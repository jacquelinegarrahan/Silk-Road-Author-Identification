				Hello, I&#039;m Synot. This is my first post on the forums but I&#039;ve been registered for a couple months. I&#039;m pretty shy to this community (and somewhat in general) but hopeful once I get used to it, that will change. I&#039;m a very kind person who tries to avoid conflict.<br />I&#039;m an aspiring graffiti artist, entrepreneur, general artist, psychonaut, and maybe someday an aspiring chemist. I am very interested in science.<br />My preferable substances that I do or want/going to do are psychedelics, dissociatives (DXM, Ketamine), empathogens, and alcohol. <br />I am from the U.S. I am a very smart person who is very open-minded and I love a good debate. <br />I am very easy to get along with. Sometimes I may be socially awkward in some form. I am very excited for future friendships that may develop from SR. I am a very responsible person when it comes to the substances I take. I research a lot of different substances. The kind of music I listen to is electronica (Aphex Twin, The Black Dog, Tycho, Bonobo, The Flashbulb, etc.), some dance (Nitrous Oxide, other), Psychedelia, I absolutely LOVE post-rock, and some other types of music as well. Finally, I hope I fit in here and that I am welcomed.

				I would agree with me being somewhat stupid and ignorant, no problem with agreeing. Ignorance, as I am new and still have a lot to learn... And stupidity, as I know I should have posted in the appropriate topic as for that I apologize. I thought posting a new topic would get me more acquainted with more people as I thought I would get less of a response by posting it in the other topic, I was also not having good judgement at the time. As for the ignorance in my first post, I think it isn&#039;t that bad as most of the things I said I keep pretty well purposely hidden, just to myself, or pretty discreet.<br /><br />Yeah, I&#039;m very interested in business and science but I am also fairly new to business (as for science, I have only recently been taking it somewhat seriously, I have always had an interest though), I try to keep an open-mind, learn from mistakes, and keep on learning in general. I will probably poke around there after I get used to the community to a little bit more. Thank you for introducing yourself/talking to me btw!<br />

				Hiyas Fella,<br /><br />welcome to the road. Travel safe and sound and you be okay. All the info you need is here.<br /><br />Rule 1: People that have the biggest mouths and attitudes on anonymous online forums are usually rather small or otherwise impaired specimens of the human species in real life, so take that with a smile and some sympathy for the poor fella on the other end. (I never quite understood the mechanics of improving one&#039;s ego by blurping bruhaha two-liners on a forum).<br /><br />However, there was some truth, take it easy on revealing too much that could be correlated to you over time. Assumed that everything you write in here goes straight into some GovGoon correlation database and stays there forever.<br /><br />Other than that, stay safe, have fun, and more stay safe...
