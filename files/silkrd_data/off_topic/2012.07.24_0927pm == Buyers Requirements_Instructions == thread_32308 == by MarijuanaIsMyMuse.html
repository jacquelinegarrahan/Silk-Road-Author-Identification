				BUYERS INSTRUCTIONS<br /><br />Please be sure to read/review:<br /><br />Vendor Profile - http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b54698f8da<br />FAQ - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=13548.0<br />Shipping Delivery Times (ESTIMATED) - http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32307.0<br /><br />=====================================================================================<br /><br />FINALIZE EARLY<br />Finalize Early is requested, but not required, for all orders.&nbsp; There is no compensation/bonus for Finalizing Early. <br /><br />=====================================================================================<br /><br />ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS:<br />You must provide your address EXACTLY as shown below.&nbsp; I use an automated order processing system so you must provide it in this format to give your package the best chance of delivery.&nbsp; Do not put anything other than your address in the address box when ordering - either clear text or via PGP.&nbsp; I use an address verification product to configure the address correctly into the format as used by your country&#039;s postal addressing requirements.<br /><br />NO REFUND IS AVAILABLE FOR ADDRESSES NOT PROVIDED IN THE FORMAT AS SHOWN BELOW.<br /><br />Place each address component on a separate line! DO NOT provide me with anything but your address - No thank yous, questions, suggestions, etc. - PM me for everything otherwise you risk your order being cancelled.<br /><br />ADDRESS FORMAT<br />Name/Business/Contact<br />Street Address &amp; Street Name<br />Apt/Unit/Suite # (If necessary - otherwise reduce to a 6 line format)<br />City<br />State/Territory/Province<br />Postal/Zip Code<br />Country<br /><br />=====================================================================================<br /><br />ONLY provide your address when placing an order.&nbsp; Addresses may be sent either via clear text or in PGP encryption.<br /><br />Asking questions, telling me a story, sending me additional information, or providing me with your PGP key does nothing but SLOW ME DOWN and take time from me to process, package and send out orders!&nbsp; Send me a PM and I will happily respond!!! ÔÅä <br /><br />=====================================================================================<br /><br />If you have an issue with either the product or delivery, contact me to resolve the issue BEFORE leaving feedback.&nbsp; If negative feedback is left without me having an opportunity to resolve the situation, no resolution will be offered and YOU WILL BE BANNED FROM PURCHASING FROM ME AGAIN.<br /><br />=====================================================================================<br /><br />For any inquiries, send me a PM and I will be happy to address your questions. If you PM me with a question that is answered in either this document, or others I have posted and made reference to, I will answer your PM with a link to my info threads.&nbsp; However, if your question is not answered, please DO send me a PM and I will respond.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />MIMM<br />

				2 months have passed but I am still angry that MIMM(MarijuanaIsMyMuse) has scammed me so ... My first order from him and then he make this ... I ordered an extra little (0.25) and still I was scammed by him. In the beginning, he has not even sent me an answer to my messages but then he writes but in fact it should have arrived long ago and he does not send a reship !!! I just hide from him leave of his reviews as well as other buyers ... annoys me the most about myself that I always see the good in everyone&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(
