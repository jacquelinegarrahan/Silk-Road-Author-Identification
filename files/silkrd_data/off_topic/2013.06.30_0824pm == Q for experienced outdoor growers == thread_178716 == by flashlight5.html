				Got a theoretical question for some guy <br /><br />That some guy is growing couple of plants outdoors (weed that is). those are now between 20 and 50 cm tall<br /><br />fertilizer<br />that guy got <br />- rooting, <br />- growing and <br />- flowering fertilizer.<br />till now only rooting fertilizer has been used... how should he continue? switch to growing? still give the rooting? when to start with the flowering?<br /><br />height<br />for their general development the plants seem a bit tall. possibly for the not ideal sun conditions. is there anything that can / should be done about it?<br /><br />there are some holes in the leaves. not alarmingly many, but some. also there seems to be some some white stuff under the leafs. <br />is there anything to do? organic &amp; free if possible?<br /><br />light<br />light is not ideal, but the plants seem to do fine. how important is direct sunlight? the more of the surrounded bushes get cut off, the more exposed they are.<br /><br />wind<br />the plants are not exposed to lots of wind since they are located between thick wall of bushes all around. that causes them to not develop strong stems. the bushes are far taller than the plants will become in the future so not much wind has to be expected. is that still likely going to be a problem? if so, what to do about it.<br /><br />thank you!

				And you say I was in way over my head???<br /><br /><br />Light: Yes direct light is important in an outdoor grow. The sun should always be hitting the plant, from sunrise until the sun sets.<br /><br />The white stuff you see are probably spider mites, or mold. I will bet it&#039;s mold because there is no air circulation, which is very important. Wipe the mold off the plants.<br /><br />

				Can some girl answer too? :)<br /><br />It&#039;s hard to say much about fertilizer w/out knowing more about the soil conditions. If the soil is decent there&#039;s not always much to be gained from messing with it - soil provides so much more than just nutes &amp; sometimes it&#039;s best to just let the plants enjoy that. But by now you should definitely be using growing fertilizer rather than rooting fertilizer. You can switch to a bloom fertilizer when they start showing signs of flowering. Go easy on the feedings, though. Over fertilizing happens way too often &amp; is one of the top reasons plants die. <br /><br />Light matters. Cut away as many of those surrounding bushes as you can. It&#039;ll help with the height thing too. (About the height: you could top them or tie them down but honestly if you&#039;re outdoors I&#039;d just let &#039;em grow.) <br /><br />If you&#039;re concerned about the strength of the stems just stake them. Put a bamboo stake into the ground about 3&quot; from the stem &amp; loosely tie the plant to the stake every 15 cm or so. Depending on what the summers are like where you live it might be a good idea to do anyway, just in case you&#039;re hit with a hard storm. <br /><br />If the white stuff on the leaves is mildew spritzing the plants w/ watered-down milk can help. Mix 1 part milk to nine parts water and spray the plant once a week or so, ideally during the sunniest part of the day. (IMPORTANT: Only do this when the plant is in the growing phase, though - not the flowering one! The milk solution works well on mildew but can encourage other molds that are dangerous to flowering plants.) <br /><br />Garlic is also v effective at pest control - and it&#039;s cheap and organic, too. You can mash up garlic cloves into a paste and then boil them into a sort of garlic &quot;tea&quot; that you can spray on the plants once cooled, or (even better) just plant a few garlic bulbs in the soil with them. The sprouting garlic will keep pests away and will also improve the soil.<br /><br />But there are a million weed-grower forums that would be far better places to ask on! Go join a few of those - I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get better responses than here!&nbsp; ;D

				thx guys / girls. <br /><br />spray them during the sun is high? sure? doesn&#039;t that &quot;burn&quot; the leafs? <br /><br />well, i thought about finding another forum after getting no input, but wouldn&#039;t be smart to ask the same Q again in a clearnet forum. also, its just small grow, moron buddy of mine didn&#039;t come around to giving me back my seeds...&nbsp; &gt;:( &gt;:( glad to get some input here, should be fine. haven&#039;t been there for 3 weeks, since rain was fine<br /><br />the soil is very good. is was before and i further prepared it well in advance. put a good mixture of all kinds of sh*t in there. so ill go easy on the fertilizer. <br /><br />

				Fertilizer???<br /><br /><br /><br />You should not put fertilizer on his/your plants whatsoever. Unless your are using pure organic, I hope you don&#039;t mean like Miracle grow<br /><br /><br />The ground should have been prepped with some peat moss

				I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to be very successful if you have it wedged too tightly between this &quot;wall of bushes&quot; that you say are taller than the plant. It needs direct sun, and the soil needs to be prepped, and then tested. balanced, and irrigated with fresh running water (not stagnant lake water, or something w/ lots of algae and bacteria). As that will only promote more pests. <br /><br />SPIDEY MITES! Roar! They look like micro-bed bugs. Fucking gross. :P

				don&#039;t know miracle grow. its normal fertilizer. buddy is using them and he knows quite a bit.<br /><br />soil has been prepped very well. well,, he&#039;ll cut down more of the bushes. but they obviously need to be surrounded by sth... or they will be seen..<br /><br />one more Q: <br />any1 got an idea on how pass high grass without leaving a visible path. right now its still visible after weeks.. :(<br /><br />One cool tip:<br />get some stinging nettles early i the spring, dig them out some place and put them near your plant. nobody likes to cross those.
