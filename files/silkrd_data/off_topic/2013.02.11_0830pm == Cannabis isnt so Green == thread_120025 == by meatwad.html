				https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ewv5xeI4uug<br /><br />I had no idea that there were over 600 outdoor grow ops, JUST IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY.&nbsp; No wonder why you guys have an abundance of bud out there in Cali.<br /><br />The video is actually talking about the negative environmental aspects that outdoor grow ops can have.&nbsp; What do you guys think?

				I watched this earlier on today!!!<br /><br />I agree there will be an environmental disaster, think about how much water the mary janes need to feed on... its the price we will have to play to smoke our beloved herb! <br /><br />We could argue that this is as bad as logging trees, would you agree?
