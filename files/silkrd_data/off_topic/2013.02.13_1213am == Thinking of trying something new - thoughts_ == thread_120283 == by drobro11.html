				Hey guys!<br /><br />We&#039;re all bout the flowers here, but thought about maybe experimenting with something new.<br /><br />We&#039;ve done shrooms once, and I tripped minimally while my friend got the short end of the tripstick.<br /><br />What would you recommend and why?

				ketamine is a great suggestion. i also recommend trying mdma and lsd. i wouldn&#039;t smoke dmt until you have more experience with psychedelics though, as it is extremely powerful and can be quite overwhelming... especially if you&#039;re not used to the psychedelic state!

				If you reach a certain dose you will just knock the fuck out, but between 80-200mg or so is where the magic happens. Don&#039;t quote me on that though because I can&#039;t be assed to hunt down a scale and just eyeball the stuff. Ketamine seems to give a radically different type of experience every time. I&#039;ve listened to Dark Side of the Moon and saw my childhood play out as if I were watching a movie projector, remembering people and events that literally haven&#039;t crossed my mind in decades. A few times I was able to carefully decontruct and work out problems that otherwise had me completely stumped. I combined it with DMT and had the most bizzare psychedelic experience of my life; and once had myself convinced that I was a creature of the night that needed to suck blood for sustenance. That was a particularly fucked up day.

It might be more intense IM/IV&#039;d, but insufflated (I&#039;m not down with needles, me pussy) ketamine for me at least has the highest (high=good) ratio of change to reality vs fear/anxiety. Takes you to super strange brain states (especially if you take a few bong rips after snorting), but I have almost no fear/anxiety fight. Though fwiw I don&#039;t get much fear/anxiety with DMT, so for me it might just be the length of shroom/LSD trips that gets to me. For me the peak of a ket+cannabis trip lasts ~2 hours, which is kinda perfect for my tastes.

				I can&#039;t snort. Makes me gag. LOL Sorry boys!<br /><br />I don&#039;t really want to do anything too hard or too dangerous/scary. I educate myself about things but as harmless as pot is, I just stick to that; no risk of doing too many marijuanas.<br /><br />I&#039;ve since ordered some NBOMe (however you say that) it&#039;s uhhh... 25i 1200ug per smartie.

				Absolutely not telling you not to try some new stuff, and there are some nice suggestions above, but I hope you don&#039;t turn your back on shrooms from one weak experience. Get yourself a batch backed by good reviews. I prefer whole but some people like the powdered stuff. if powdered, soak in citrus juice for a bit first. If whole, make tea. Drink the tea and eat the shrooms. Then smoke/vape a bowl of some good weed. There will be magic.

				If you just want to &quot;try&quot; something, but not go too deep in it at first, <br />you might think of Ketamine (small bumps) or DMT (&lt;30mg). <br />Both will be really nice experiences and &quot;mushy&quot; (= safe in a comfortable, smooth way). <br /><br />If you wanna &quot;rock the top&quot; I&#039;d go for a good portion of LSD (200ug), mescaline (400mg), shrooms (quantity depending on what shroom and from what buyer), high dose of K or high dose of DMT (&gt;50mg). <br /><br />MDMA can be nice as well, but don&#039;t go to hard at first (125mg is a perfect dose for most people to start with, in a capsule or parachuted). <br />Coke is higly overrated. If you get your hands on some &quot;real stuff&quot; it&#039;s worth the experience, but even on the Road it&#039;s almost impossible to get the quality that you should have to make it worth the money/time/effort. <br />2C-B seems to be pretty nice also (I still need to try it out myself) - light dose for light feeling, bigger dose for heavy tripping... <br /><br />If you&#039;re into opiates you could try opium. Very mushy... <br /><br />You see, it&#039;s all about what you like: do you like base-jumping or a walk in the forest? <br />Do you like being confronted with yourself (psychedelics) or do you prefer an ego-boost (amphetamines)...<br />

I&#039;m the type that enjoys exploring herself, but in a mushy kinda way ;)<br /><br />I&#039;m not really looking for anything hard or superdangerous, as stated before. I&#039;m not into amphets - had a meth stint a decade ago and I&#039;m not looking to aggrevate my anxiety issues :P<br /><br />We should be getting in some NBOMe 25i sometime soon, so that&#039;ll be interesting. I&#039;ve read it&#039;s not as &quot;deep&quot; of a trip like shrooms or acid, but should be at least fun!<br /><br />I think i&#039;ll be trying some MDMA soon - we&#039;ve been looking into that as well and I haven&#039;t had X in 10 years and even then, who knows what it really was (local shit, small town, you do the math LOL).<br /><br />Keep em comin&#039; guys!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Yeah, definitely try 25i, especially if it&#039;s still legal where you live. All the LSD-fanatics will tell you that NBOMes are shit (which is extremely hypocritical considering their boasting of their supposed open-mindedness), which they&#039;re not. They have next to no potential for spiritual experiences (which is probably the cause for the hate they get) but they&#039;re very, very powerful psychedelics and hallucinogens nonetheless and can provide tons of fun (and dangers, so they must never be underestimated).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I am an LSD-fanatic, and i somewhat agree with you. There is such a thing as unwanted spiritual revelations which may occur with LSD. LSD is not for everyone. If you JUST want to have some hallucinogenic fun, then NBOMe would be a good option (or a low dose of LSD). Of course, spiritual experiences can also be intensely &#039;fun&#039; as well. The spiritual euphoria is better than any other high you&#039;ll get, in my opinion. But it can also be a kind of hell.<br /><br />I think that LSD should only be taken by people who are serious about finding out who they are. It is for philosophically minded, spiritually minded, artistically minded, and/or scientifically minded people. It&#039;s not something that should be taken by the average joe.

				[edit]On 25i,[/edit] I&#039;ve had plenty of typical psychedelic realizations and thought processes, and enhanced appreciation and comprehension and creativity and all that. It&#039;s not really superficial even if it is fun, but not particularly social. I have intense and complex closed eye visuals that verify the artistic capabilities of my mind, and the ability to hear fully formed, perfect and original works of music in any genre built element by element. But no you can&#039;t really go that deep because your feet will turn purple and all that and yes acid is the best so far.
