				Maybe Im wrong but some of the things posted in these forums are so absurd, I actually try to stay away from them.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been a member here for over 2 years i dont even know how many orders, and it seems to me that the statements &quot;CD&#039;s are a regular occurence&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;Crackdown on blahhhhhh&quot;&nbsp; 2 years ago i think they had that same crackdown.&nbsp; Whoever &quot;they&quot; are.&nbsp; Unless you are wanted by the marshals, you can stop looking out your window, get your packages, and stop reading whatever your reading,&nbsp; Im sure many disagree, maybe im wrong, keep looking out the windows and posting asking for help.&nbsp; &nbsp;I dont think its needed though, thats just my opinion, obviously be as safe as possible.

				In the words of astor &quot;many people have regretted not being secure enough, but no one has ever regretted being too secure.&quot; <br /><br />That being said, SR is still extremely safe and easy to use if you take proper pre-cautions.

				I would say that as long as you are not spending large amounts of time stressing out over your use of this site, a healthy dose of paranoia can certainly be helpful in protecting you. I read as much as I can just to have the information, and some of it can be scary but it&#039;s just good to know what&#039;s going on and what kinds of things can go wrong so that you can try to avoid them yourself.

You can use it for your address. Part of the reason my operation runs so fast is because I don&#039;t have to waste extra time trying to read secretive messages or use that stupid time wasting, good for nothing, pgp.<br /><br />Don&#039;t be the one slowing the packaging and shipping down with your privnote last second after my time cut off time with a long message for me to read and respond to. I am very busy!<br /><br />Privnote is safe, fast, and easy. And totally not needed. BUT if you feel you need to..then use it. I don&#039;t care. But don&#039;t use it to send me a question..A big waste of time. You are too paranoid and stupid... Go to another vendor or jump off a building. And try and hit Astor.<br /><br />▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------░▒▓█ P G P █▓▒░--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀<br />If you want to use pgp...go to another vendor. Or contact Astor and have him get you in the pgp club. It is for losers that know nothing and think they know everything. I am sure they are preppers too. And I am sure they also believed in Y2K.<br /><br />If SR ever gets compromised they will want ME--NOT YOU!! And they sure as fuck won&#039;t look at orders and find your address and do something. I don&#039;t have the space to get into it...but it is the biggest myth on SR. I have heard so many lame reasons. But they all love to say it is an added layer of security. Total bullshit...but whatever...NO PGP FOR THE KING! EVER. I would move to Canada and change my citizenship before I would use PGP.<br /><br />But the beautiful thing about SR is you have a choice! So exercise that choice and if you do not like that I do not use it...go fuck yourself. But before you do that...try and get a good TRUE reason why you should waste your time with it! It actually only takes seconds to use it...so if it worked I would use it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OK apparently he has been a vendor for 17 months with more sales than 90% of vendors and I&#039; have been a customer for 2 years and probably have placed more orders than 90% of buyers. And we both think this that even using privnote is absurd. I admit I will use it maybe half the time BUT ONLY to jump on the band wagon.&nbsp; The other half I just right my real name and address.&nbsp; &nbsp;For 2 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;Now if any buyer has been on here longer than 2 years with more orders than I have placed Ill listen,<br />As far as vendors go I have no say.&nbsp; &nbsp;But his profile says it all. <br />&nbsp;And I never even ordered from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;So please no one post anymore nonsense about law enforcement Im tired of looking at it to be honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;If you are worried look it up.&nbsp; OR check out your window because then if anything happened your safe.&nbsp; I have a feeling that long time vendors like that just dont even post on the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />I dont want to hear the term &quot;red flag&quot; anymore, I hate that term.&nbsp; And no theres never been a controlled delivery from this site.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care what the news says or anything, 0 times has that happened.&nbsp; And every person reading this knows it hasnt happened to them, (only a friend they know)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

Oh, those hideous eyes...&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But seriously, this is illegal shit we&#039;re doin&#039; here. Is it paranoid to fear going to jail for purchasing illicit drugs? I&#039;ve known several people in my life to serve jail time (even serious prison time) for possesion of amounts smaller than what I buy here on SR... and I don&#039;t buy very much.<br /><br />Even though the probability of my house being destroyed by a tornado is practically nil, it DOES happen. That&#039;s why I have windstorm insurance. So, am I being paranoid? Should I drop my insurance? After all, it&#039;s highly unlikely that I will ever need it.<br /><br />That seems utterly ignorant and irresponsible to me... and so does the refusal to utilize such a quick, simple, and FREE info insurance as PGP. However, I will certainly agree with RxKing on one point... <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: RxKing</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you want to use pgp... go to another vendor.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Personally, I would never use a vendor that didn&#039;t value my freedom enough to spend 5 seconds decrypting my address (the only thing I ever bother to encrypt, as it&#039;s the only identifying info I ever send from Tor). Perhaps I&#039;m just a totally paranoid, gun-totin&#039;, government-hatin&#039;, doomsday-preppin&#039;, spam-suckin&#039;, bomb-shelter-dwellin&#039;, harbinger of doom... but even THAT would be my choice and my freedom, and that I shall entrust to no one.<br /><br />Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;m off to go fuck myself.

				The problem is how you define &quot;too paranoid&quot; and how you measure it.&nbsp; In the absence of real data, you only know if you&#039;re &quot;too paranoid&quot; if you never get caught.&nbsp; So, you never know if tomorrow you will not have been paranoid enough.

Sure there is...<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: DelusionalFreakazoid</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">&quot;Oh my god, there&#039;s that two-year-old toddler with the tooth again! He always chases me to the sidewalk when I walk past his house on my way to work, shaking his rattle at me. I can tell by the menacing gleem in his eyes that he intends me only harm. Oh, those hideous eyes...&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But seriously, this is illegal shit we&#039;re doin&#039; here. Is it paranoid to fear going to jail for purchasing illicit drugs? I&#039;ve known several people in my life to serve jail time (even serious prison time) for possesion of amounts smaller than what I buy here on SR... and I don&#039;t buy very much.<br /><br />Even though the probability of my house being destroyed by a tornado is practically nil, it DOES happen. That&#039;s why I have windstorm insurance. So, am I being paranoid? Should I drop my insurance? After all, it&#039;s highly unlikely that I will ever need it.<br /><br />That seems utterly ignorant and irresponsible to me... and so does the refusal to utilize such a quick, simple, and FREE info insurance as PGP. However, I will certainly agree with RxKing on one point... <div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: RxKing</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">If you want to use pgp... go to another vendor.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Personally, I would never use a vendor that didn&#039;t value my freedom enough to spend 5 seconds decrypting my address (the only thing I ever bother to encrypt, as it&#039;s the only identifying info I ever send from Tor). Perhaps I&#039;m just a totally paranoid, gun-totin&#039;, government-hatin&#039;, doomsday-preppin&#039;, spam-suckin&#039;, bomb-shelter-dwellin&#039;, harbinger of doom... but even THAT would be my choice and my freedom, and that I shall entrust to no one.<br /><br />Now if you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;m off to go fuck myself.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />*Applauds wildly*<br /><br />The thing for everyone who&#039;s worried at the moment to remember is to use common-sense, intuition and general security precautions. As you say about house insurance, I too don&#039;t leave my house&#039;s doors open when I leave and a sign for the burglars to help themselves. I switch on the alarm, lock that fucker up and go about my day.<br /><br />I DO think there&#039;s a lot of pointless speculation from feeble-minded types here in the forums who probably spoke too much pot and are going over what ifs when they&#039;d do best to bone up on the latest security measures they can take and to take them. <br /><br />That said, for me the risks of using SR weighed against the pros are worth it. <br /><br />

It gives a total false sense of security. <br /><br /><br />

Several programmers/researchers visited the site and got an error msg, then analysed Firefox and saw malware had been injected into a flaw in its javascript code, exactly like a similar code that had been used on pedo sites that were also hosted by Freedom Hosting. Many many people have verified this. The below thread is probably the best discussion on it. If you have evidence to refute these contentions by all means go ahead but just merely saying it&#039;s not true and is bullshit won&#039;t cut it. <br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195878.0
