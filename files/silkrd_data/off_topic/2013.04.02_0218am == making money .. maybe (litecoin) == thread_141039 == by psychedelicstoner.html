				vircurex.com (NOT virwex.com, that&#039;s a scam site) and btc-e.com seem to be the main places to get it. You can trade BTC for LTC.<br />

				Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but didn&#039;t lite coin just more than double in the past two weeks?&nbsp; &nbsp;Psycadelic stoner said it was like .53.&nbsp; And now 1.80.&nbsp; &nbsp;?!?!!&nbsp; Holy shit .&nbsp; &nbsp;So, if you bought like $1000.&nbsp; You would have more than doubled your money!<br /><br />WTF<br />

				I was told it was pretty much pointless to spend time mining BTC.&nbsp; Is it any different for LTC?&nbsp; &nbsp;Also plz be patient with me I&#039;m not great with computers but - Is mining just downloading the software, starting it, and then letting it run?&nbsp; &nbsp;
