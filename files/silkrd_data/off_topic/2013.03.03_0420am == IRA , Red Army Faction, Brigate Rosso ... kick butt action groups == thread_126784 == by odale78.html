				do you still remember the good ole days, when the pigs actually had to fear for their lives ?&nbsp; :&#039;( <br /><br />remember : RAF whacked the CEO of Deutsche Bank real quick one day.&nbsp; :P ::) <br /><br />one RAF guy in trial didn&#039;t like the way the Attourney General of Germany talked, so they whacked the fucker.&nbsp; ;D ;D ;D <br /><br /><br />What&#039;s happening these days ?&nbsp; The fucking bankers fucking rip off the public, and everyone pays gladly.<br /><br />seems there are no BLACK PANTHERS around any longer...<br />

				Because those groups, such as the Black Panthers, succumbed to in-fighting. Tupac wasn&#039;t killed by the US govt, though they probably tried;. the Black Panthers killed Tupac.<br /><br />Now, whether or not the black panthers were infiltrated by the US gov&#039;t is the question... But every group that rises and combats LE, is made up of the same stuff that LE is... Humans.

				The IRA havent gone away, they were just compromised and led by brit agents for twenty years or so, they&#039;re currently re arming and re organising by the signs of it here in Ireland,<br /><br />They executed a screw and a Brit policeman here in the last 12 months, and had a few attacks resulting in injury / economic damage. <br /><br />Hopefully he good ol days when the Irish fought back are comin back! Politically left too.<br /><br />The Palestinian and Iraqi resistance are others who rock, they dont muck about.

				<br />some of those dudes end up in government even.<br /><br />like this woman Dilma (Roussef ?) who runs Brazil. She used to be a Guerilla fighter / Stadtguerillero<br /><br />but many are in jail. a few RAF folks are still out there doing bank jobs asf.<br />
