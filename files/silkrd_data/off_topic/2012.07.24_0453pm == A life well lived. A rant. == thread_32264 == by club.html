				Warning: incoming rant. I&#039;m lower-middle class, in my mid 30s. I work 45 hours a week at a job I hate, because I need money to eat and occasionally buy things that entertain me. But it&#039;s an unfair trade-off in my opinion.<br /><br />Let&#039;s look at a day. Twenty-four hours. Technically, youre supposed to sleep 8 hours a night. That leaves 16 waking hours left. Of those 16, you&#039;re supposed to work 8 of them... or even more for some of us. I work a 9 hour day, so of those 16 waking hours, I get less than half to myself to enjoy life, and more than half is consumed by a prison of khakis and personal computers. <br /><br />Young adulthood is a special time when you have the most fun. I like to party, go out, dance, drink, flirt with girls, all that. That lifestyle is only going to get harder to do every 10 years I age. Now is the time I should be enjoying the fuck out of it, not wasting all my time confined to an office. Is this living life? Giving up over half my waking hours to do shit I hate? I submit that this is not living and enjoying life. For example, it&#039;s sunny outside right now. I should fucking be out there in it right now instead of trapped in this office. I know it&#039;s hacky, but Steve Buscemi nailed it with a line in Con Air:<br /><br />&quot;What if I told you insane was working a 50-hour week for 50 years, at the end of which they tell you to piss off? Ending up in some retirement village, hoping to die rather than suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time. Wouldn&#039;t you consider that to be insane?&quot;<br /><br />Fuckin&#039; A.<br /><br />When I was a kid I used to fantasize about being rich and famous. Now I&#039;d be happy to just make my current salary without having to waste 45 hours a week of my life in the process. Then I had a realization. My favorite vendor on here only has to sell 12 small orders (8th of weed) per week, to equal my entire fucking salary. He grows and tends to his plants, which would actually be an enjoyable hobby to me, harvests it, packs it, ships it, and he&#039;s done. And making fistfuls more money than I do for doing a fraction of the effort around the clock. I want this life. I want to travel. I want to sleep in everyday. I want to be able to tend to my plants, send some boxes out, and have the whole rest of the fucking day to do whatever I want. I want my day job to be video games and exercise and reading.<br /><br />What&#039;s stopping me? I know I will get caught. I always got caught anytime I did anything &quot;illegal&quot;. And Im so not prison material. Im a small quiet guy. I would get rolled on in prison. So the fear of big black cocks in my ass and mouth daily stop me from pursuing the life I want. I&#039;m not worried about the shipping part. I know there are quite safe ways of dropping off your packages. I&#039;m more scared about getting busted growing. If you get busted trying to send 1 small package, you&#039;ll get a slap on the wrist. But get busted with a grow op, and you&#039;re fucked.<br /><br />But every year I keep getting older, like clockwork. I&#039;m starting to think I should just fucking risk it. It takes money to make money. I wouldn&#039;t keep selling forever. I would just try to make enough to work with and use it to create more wealth. I just need a springboard to get out of this hellhole rut. I don&#039;t want to spend the rest of my life struggling just to just get by. I want to be comfortable. I want to love my life. And I don&#039;t right now.<br />

				this is what happens when you just float through life not knowing what you want. if you want money, then do something about it. growing weed is easy but theres other ways that are legal. personally, i think money will never make you truly happy. doing something that you are proud of, that will help humanity will. [in my opinion]

				i think a lot of people feel this way. I recently quit a job wherein people there (mostly I avoided this) would be forced to work 100 hours per week with no overtime. This is called the &quot;exempt&quot; employee, because you are exempt from labor laws by your own volition. What&#039;s next, &quot;exempt&quot; child laborers? That being said, you need to understand what is really important in life. You are crying out for free time but you mention nothing productive that you will fill that free time with. You are essentially saying in your post that you want money without working, and the extra time you gain you sill spend playing video games, getting fucked up and going out clubbing, and working out. Not to sound harsh, but your job is the only thing that is forcing you to add value to our collective culture instead of detracting. Your only satisfaction about life comes from consuming but not from producing. Everything you mentioned about how you want to spend your free time is a result of your addictions in life brought on by marketing campaigns and a self centered middle class culture that breeds adult children with such a sense of entitlement. You&#039;ve described a life wherein you&#039;ve been fortunate enough to get bored because you don&#039;t have to worry about the survival aspect of being a human being. Yet you don&#039;t make enough money to really take it to the next level and fill that void with something else. I suggest you fill it with something meaningful. Work your damn job and don&#039;t complain about your wages. As much as possible, spread the fruits of your labor among loved ones and others whom you can take satisfaction in helping. Learn to love yourself. Break free of your bonds to video games, drugs, drinking, stimulation, and culture for just a short while at least. When you clear your head of these things you might see through your problems more clearly. It sounds like you are incapable of loving and a little emotionally detached from the true purpose of life. <br /><br />This is just my opinion about you from the very little you posted, I could certainly be wrong. If not you however, a lot of other people seem to echo your sentiment at least as I perceive it.

				very interesting post. i am in a similar bind. i have a good paying job but spend way too much time away from home or doing things i dont want to do just to get a pay cheque. i wish i could travel or not have to worry about money. i could probably make a good additional income off of SR but i no longer have the connects to get the amount of drugs needed to be a consistent vendor. what to do ... what to do. guess just keep doing the 9to5 until i catch a lucky or unlucky break. either way u just gotta keep truckin ;) <br /><br />stay strong brother. things may be boring and repeitive for a while but eventually things will change for the better. u just gotta figure your shit out. i know im still doing that. SR has brought the most joy into my life in a long long time. finally i feel free again. able to purchase whatever i feel like. finally feel sovereign over my own body. long live SR and good luck in your future quest to find happiness and fulfillment!<br /><br />MBMC

				If you don&#039;t have a family then just quit. Fuck it. Watch the movie &#039;Into the Wild&#039; and do everything that guy does. Enjoy the fuck out of life. You don&#039;t need money. <br /><br />Go be happy. Trainhop, ride a bike, hike. Travel the world under your own power. <br /><br />If that&#039;s not a viable option. Stop dreaming, and go back to school and get a degree in something you enjoy that doesn&#039;t require you to be in an office for 45 hours a week. <br /><br />If you think you&#039;ll get caught growing weed, then don&#039;t do it.

				Once upon a time, I would&#039;ve become an actuary because the salaries I heard about were pretty awesome and I&#039;m pretty awesome with numbers.<br /><br />Flash forward a few years, a lot of drugs, and some time living on the street later, and I don&#039;t care how much I&#039;m making as long as I&#039;m doing something that makes me happy, something that helps others, something that moves me forward towards what I want, and I&#039;m doing it with my friends.<br /><br />Don&#039;t try to make tons of money to be happy. Just try to be happy by doing what makes you so.

				Seems to me like your main issue is that you don&#039;t like your job. It might not seem like it right now, but find something you would rather be doing and then do it. If that&#039;s growing pot then do it. If it&#039;s too much of a risk (which would arguably reduce how much you&#039;re going to enjoy it, stress and that) then don&#039;t, but do find something you want to do and do it.<br /><br />I think there are a lot of people who have been where you are. I have, but I&#039;m on my way to something better right now :)
