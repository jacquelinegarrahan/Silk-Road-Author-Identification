				(Warning, all links below are clearnet.)<br /><br />https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.0<br /><br />Basically, the creator of Bitcoin (whoever he is) owns 100M USD worth of coin at today&#039;s prices. Do you guys think that&#039;s fair, since obviously he is the one who made all this possible, or are you with some of the folks on Bitcointalk and think this was all an elaborate scam for him to get rich?<br /><br />I think he deserves the money. After all, he brought crypto-currencies, which had previously basically been a joke (see: E-gold http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/06/e-gold/) to the forefront of people&#039;s attention and legitimized the whole space.<br /><br />

				He mined the first blocks, so it makes sense he has the money.<br /><br />It was a hit or miss anyways, what would he have done had this currency NOT taken off the ground?

				Im always posting about this to people. <br /><br />Bitcoins are made fewer and fewer every year. Satoshi probably had 100M of BTC when they started making them and they were worth peanuts. <br />Look at the prices now? If he cashed in he would be a fucking billionaire. But my bet is he is waiting until they make very very few per year and rely on coins in &quot;circulation&quot; already. <br /><br />I reckon if he invented them , Then he deserves to get money out of the idea. Even if it was originally meant to be a get rich quick scheme.

				There are many unsupported (and refuted) claims in that post. No one knows who got what in the early days, and more pertinently, who saved what.&nbsp; One of the unresolved questions about Bitcoins, I think, is what is the effect of lost wallets - bitcoins vanishing, never to resurface.&nbsp; Now that they are worth $100 each, there&#039;s less of that, but back in the days of almost zero value? Who knows what people did?<br /><br />Whatever Satoshi has, he/she deserves, and it&#039;s no money out of my pocket or your pocket...
