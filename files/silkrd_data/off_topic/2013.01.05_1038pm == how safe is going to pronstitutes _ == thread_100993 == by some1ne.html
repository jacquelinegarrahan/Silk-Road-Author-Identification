				Never FE!<br />I suggest you avoid the ones with refunds over 5%<br />Condoms wont save you from the nasty shit out there. If ones not available, give&nbsp; her one in the shitta. it costs a bit more but your worth it.

				Well sir.. let me start by telling you a little story about whores.. <br /><br />i married one and she cheated on me with random niggers and beaners that sold heroin.. she would leave in the middle of the night, come home late from &#039;work&#039; and claim she was sick when really she had a herpes outbreak..(she told me all this after the break up and 2 kids) <br /><br />After we split.. i thought well ive been fucking one shouldnt i just try to fuck a hotter one? shit i paid a lot more for the one i lived with and called my wife so whats the big deal right?<br />WRONG.. so i go to MLK BLV .. most cities u will find whores or crack there.. <br /><br />and i looked for a big breasted fat ass having black whore who said wouldnt mind being with me for a whole night leaving in the morning.. <br />&nbsp;so i BOINKED HER.. it was amazing best sex ever when we were done it felt like i took a X pill and it is a memory i will have forever...<br /><br />but then again.. so is the aids i contracted from letting her suck my penis.. <br />i know its from her because i had gotten tested after the break up and the bad news she broke to me. <br /><br />so i now go to the doctor every other week to get check ups and such.. <br /><br />n every time i got to the doctor he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a bunch of spaghetti.. <br /><br />so moral of the story.. <br /><br />always bring a fork to the doctor<br />

				I haven&#039;t tried this but I know some friends who have used eros.com to choose escorts and they have said good things.<br /><br />At least this way you can pick a hot respectable chick instead of a dirty street whore.

				The best and most expensive ($300) fuck I ever had was in a private booth at a strip club. She coulda been in the movies WOW.<br /><br />But a condom is 100% MANDATORY! Don&#039;t ever take that chance, no matter how clean and yummy they look. You don&#039;t even want to think about how many crackhead loads could have been blown in there. As a very wise man once said &quot;just cuz you can&#039;t smell it doesn&#039;t mean it don&#039;t stink!&quot;

				Prostitutes are usually very desperate.&nbsp; If you must use one, save up your money and get a call girl from one of those websites.&nbsp; &nbsp;Going to a Brothel in Vegas would be best, they all get STD checks regularly.<br /><br />Not sure about &quot;pronstitutes&quot; though. ;)

Streetwalkers are usually infected (no offense). This pack of weirdos walked past me when I was leaving the gym and asked for sex and I was like yeaaaaaaaah, I can see THAT happening. I told them to fuck off. (Tip, if girls approach someone with a dude in tow it ain&#039;t gonna happen for you sweetie.) I could they were dodgy. Yar, you can always tell the females who are hanging out the front of our gym just to perve on guys coming out from the &quot;legitimate purpose&quot; others. <br /><br />btw, what is backpage???? Is it an internet site? <br /><br />btw, SorryMarrio, you got a girl&#039;s name you muppet! ::) A Princess is usually female..... I thought you were lesbian, and then I figured it out.<br /><br />Piece out. Drive safely.

				okay what im going to tell you is like the secret to young pussy&nbsp; i swear. ::) i heard it from someone else but its golden and very true<br /><br />women under the age of 28 or so, do not understand how much of an asset beauty is. they dont know how special it makes them, and it makes it easy to get with them.<br />they dont understand their value in a sense... and if your older than them thats another plus... women like a wise man that can take care of them.<br /><br />if you still lack confidence and dont want to get shot down, find a girl that has something that would cause a slight insecurity but doesnt bother you really.<br />( like a big nose, crooked teeth, you get the idea.)<br />i realize this sounds like some soul-less shit but women manipulate men so much nowadays(or try ) that it becomes too much of a hassle to play the games that go along with a relationship.<br /><br />good luck getting your dick wet, but dont get a prostitute&nbsp; :o thats sad and pathetic. just talk to some girls.<br /><br />oh and i guess i should include that, the guy that walks around at parties and asks every girl if they want to fuck, is almost guaranteed to get laid. some girl is going to say yes eventually..

				Far too many people are complacent about condom sex.<br /><br />Condoms do nothing to protect you against herpes, which is a serious and incurable disease.<br /><br />Don&#039;t rely on condoms. Investigate the sexual history of your chosen partner. If that person has a promiscuous past, avoid!<br /><br />Obviously prostitutes are a bad choice.

				It depends entirely on where you get your prostitutes. <br /><br />My partner and I have spent a lot of money on female escorts over the years. She&#039;s bisexual and every now and then we throw a private party. Good escorts are expensive (around £200 per hour) so it&#039;s only a rare treat but these girls are very clean and very pretty.<br /><br />I suspect I wouldn&#039;t have so much confidence if I were paying for a £40 crack whore from the street and my partner probably wouldn&#039;t want to go down on her.<br /><br />Lessons to learn? Pay the extra man!

				I hate the stigma against having paid sex. If you&#039;re piss-drunk in Vegas, and up a couple $100 from gambling, why not spend some of that &quot;hard-earned&quot; money on a great blowjob before you lose it at the tables. Then, when you&#039;re broke the next day, at least you got that blowjob. The casino can&#039;t take that shit away! Obviously use a condom.

But I also don&#039;t understand why prostitution is illegal. It&#039;s been around forever, its called the worlds oldest profession for a reason. Make it legal, regulate it and make it safe. Like the legal brothels in Nevada. Hooking on the street should still be illegal though.

				i will tell you about my personal experience with escorts.<br /><br />i have had sex with 4 escorts. i saw that someone had mentioned &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; and it is the most true in this business. i would recommend only calling girls who advertise at $225/hr +. they are more likely low traffic and therefore less likely to pass something unfavorable to you. that theory isnt a perfect one, but if youre really itching for some kitty calling an escort is one way to go.<br /><br />my personal recommendation is to look at it from a monetary standpoint. if youre to spend $100 on a girl at a bar, you would save yourself a lot of money. and she might even sleep with you again, which means you dont have to pay $100 again. but you still might have to take her out to a nice dinner (~$50), which - again - is still cheaper. also its probably better to just try to pick up on chicks in general, because you might even end up meeting baby momma material.
