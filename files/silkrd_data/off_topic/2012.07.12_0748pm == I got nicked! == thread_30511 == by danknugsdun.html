				In the UK the feds don&#039;t just come knocking.<br /><br />It was quite a rowdy party. Loud music, screaming bitches, few fights so the feds were called by neighbors who think a pussy is a rubber hole on a doll.<br /><br />Feds got called, I don&#039;t vacuum pack any of my street deals, I just pin fold my jeans/trousers (American: pants) and stick 1/8th baggies in there. The rest was stuffed in my pants (American: drawers, panties) whatever lol.<br /><br />Had court hearing and gave me a caution which I am more than happy with! <br /><br />Cashflow is still a major issue for me at the moment as the 2oz was my only stock at that time. With monies tied up elsewhere and no stock I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be back for atleast another 2 weeks.<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna try and lower my prices a little so I can get more volume in and keep things rolling for all you guys who have supported me and love my nugs!<br /><br />Stay safe strangers<br /><br />Dank

				Feds is not a term used by any police, customs or agencies. Slang bought from the USA.<br /><br />In the UK, its common for police to turn up at rowdy parties. <br /><br />And when your drunk, high, stoned its not easy to quickly dispose of the evidence.<br /><br />Still, its personal use right?<br /><br />100 hours community service of if you have prior maybe a bigger fine and more hours.<br /><br />All depends on whether the two oz was in deals.<br /><br />Even then you can argue you bought it like that. Plus you need to careful dosing.<br /><br />Best say nothing, after all it only takes one cop to make a mistake and evidence gets lost so that is why many deny even when it &#039;seems&#039; obvious.<br /><br />Good luck bro.
