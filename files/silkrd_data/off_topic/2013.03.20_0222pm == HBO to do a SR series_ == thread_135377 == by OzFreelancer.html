				&quot;HBO has hired Kill List and Sightseers director Ben Wheatley to write, executive produce and direct a new original series called Silk Road. Details of the show&#039;s plot are being closely guarded for now, but what we do know is that they&#039;re calling it a &quot;thriller&quot; and it&#039;s said to be &quot;in the vein of The Prisoner.&quot; &quot;<br /><br /><br />http://twitchfilm.com/2013/03/ben-wheatley-is-going-down-the-silk-road-for-hbo.html<br /><br />

				This WILL NOT be about THE Silk Road.&nbsp; It will be about the ancient trading route of the same name.

				I am not 100% sure about it being on the ancient trading route but I don&#039;t believe that any TV station is going to make a FULL series about THE Silk Road.&nbsp; I will put my foot in my mouth if it is proven that this will be about SR the marketplace.

				Even if this one is not about SR, I think it would be interesting to see a documentary about the Road at some point. Who knows, maybe 10 years from now we will all be hailed as visionaries and pioneers....

				How would they get anyone on camera to talk about it? I remember reading once where DPR said he had been aproached to speak at some conference, and he said he even entertained the idea briefly before declining the offer. How would that have worked? Aside from being on of the coolest fucking guys in the history of alt culture, he&#039;s unfortunately probably also one of the most wanted figures.<br /><br />

Students of history are welcome to leave comments guessing about the symbolic or actual significance of this association. However, more recently, Silk Road has become more well known as the name of an anonymous online black market, which, according to a 2011 Gawker report, &quot;makes buying and selling illegal drugs as easy as buying used electronics--and seemingly as safe.&quot; Or you know, perhaps it has nothing to do with either of those things.&quot;<br /><br />This was taken from the link that was posted by the OP. It seems as tho this site was named after the original trading route anyway. It also seems that a show like this would be like a reality show involving 3 letter organizations and they would have to have actors playing the part of Silk Roaders unless they used people who were already in jail or on probation from using the road. Ya know, people who have already been caught and their real identity exposed because who wants to be exposed?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
