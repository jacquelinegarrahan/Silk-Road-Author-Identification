				^ Nice suggestion. I do always feel like I&#039;m in a bit of a time warp on acid.<br /><br />Did you know that Seth Rogan plays one of the bullies in Donnie Darko? Just a random bit of info.<br /><br />Have you seen S. Darko? It&#039;s worth watching. Nothing spectacular, though.

				on 1channel we streamed an independent film, a comedy, two nights ago, called &quot;Wrong&quot;. It was quite funny and we were sober. The movie is strange by itself, I think watching it while tripping would give quite a ride lol.

				On our last &quot;voyage&quot; (alice and K)<br />we watched (once we were way up among the stars) Madagascar 3 - but without sound. <br />Meanwhile we tuned in to this internet radio station: http://streema.com/radios/play/2159 <br />and had that music play while Madagascar3 was playing on mute...<br /><br />it was EPIC!!! Without any doubt the best &quot;movie&quot; we&#039;ve seen while flying <br />and the soundtrack was unbeatable!!!<br />enjoy&nbsp; ;D

				Thanks for the awesome input, you guys. I haven&#039;t even heard of a lot of these movies. I tried watching the new Alice in Wonderland while tripping one time, but just couldn&#039;t get into it. Also Inception is hard for me to follow, but I&#039;m sure it will make much more sense when tripping. I&#039;m going to check out A Scanner Darkly soon and see what it&#039;s talking about.<br /><br />Figure I&#039;ll add some movies I watched and loved when tripping..<br /><br />- Hotel Transylvania<br />- Trailer Park Boys<br />- Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit<br />- Life of Pi<br />- House on Haunted Hill<br /><br />On a side note, I suggest everyone go to the theaters and see Django Unchained. Fucking EPIC movie, tripping or not.

				Hmm, I don&#039;t know, most of the movies on your list seem kind of heavy. Which wouldn&#039;t be enjoyable really. Especially during the first half of the trip.<br /><br />I know that my first trip was extremely childlike and I decided to watch Elf. Literally the most hilarious movie on acid I have to say. I&#039;d definitely recommend a light comedy like Elf, or Zoolander, or anything of the sorts. But it really depends on what kind of trip you have, whether it be more childlike, visual, or introspective.<br /><br />I know that some people said Fantasia is awesome while tripping because of the music and visuals, but I didn&#039;t get much visuals my first trip so that movie did absolutely nothing for me. Turned it off not even 5 minutes in.<br /><br />So yeah, try something light. You might be able to watch a deeper movie like Inception, like Donnie Darko, like Memento, like The Matrix, during your comedown. That&#039;s always when I&#039;ve been more introspective and wanting to think new things. It also helps watching a movie you&#039;ve never seen before so you can really follow it and not get bored.

				While i agree being out in nature and/or doing something besides being trapped inside is better for tripping, if your going to watch something while tripping, i suggest EdBassmaster on youtube. Funniest/Funnest shit ever when trippin. He goes in public places with a fart device that uses his hand to make the noise, not batteries. Each fart sounds different. I sound it sounds immature an all, but watching these people react is fuckin hilarious. <br /><br />I want just one person to dose and watch these guys videos, it&#039;ll make my day knowing im not the only one who thinks that shit is hilarious.

				Well, I definitely agree with all of you that said you should go outside whilst tripping, but sometimes it&#039;s just too cold outside.<br /><br />I watched Waking Life the other day. Interesting, yet boring. I read Philip K. Dick&#039;s A Scanner Darkly, since the movie was so awesome. It really fills in what the movie left out.

				I would agree for the most part watching a movie while tripping is probably not the most productive thing to do.&nbsp; However, towards the end of the trip and your just looking to chill i would definitely recommend Scanner Darkly.&nbsp; Its such a trippy movie and the animation involved just looks crazy when your trippin.&nbsp; This does make it very hard to follow though i must say.

				Ghost In the Shell just about killed me with its sheer awesomeness. Also Ponyo. Ponyo wins for the straight up visual effects. I haven&#039;t watched any other Miazaki movies while tripping, but I bet they&#039;re all worth checking out. Groundhog&#039;s Day would be kinda nice. <br />However.... The Fountain with Hugh Jackman, and that English girl I like is probably my favorite tripping movie. Go check it out. Even if you aren&#039;t tripping but especially if you are. Here are two CLEARNET links to some screenshots:<br />http://www.spiritualteachers.org/images/fountain.jpg<br />http://moviemezzanine.com/wp-content/uploads/fountain-1.png<br />Hugh Jackman spend about 1/5 of the movie floating around in this bubble spaceship thing, and the background looks unbelievable. Apparently they filmed some bacteria in a petri dish and digitally modified it to get those shots. Or something like that.

Seriously, don&#039;t mock it until you try it.<br />I even paused it to look at how beautiful the princess is (once sober I find her less so). Serious fun.<br /><br />Best movie K-Holed and setup properly (Big screen, big subwoofer, blackout blinds) was LotR: Fellowship of the Ring<br />Felt like I was with Frodo for a good 30mins. Got through 5 grams of K to finish the trilogy though =/ by the end it didn&#039;t work anymore, just kinda paralyzed me haha
