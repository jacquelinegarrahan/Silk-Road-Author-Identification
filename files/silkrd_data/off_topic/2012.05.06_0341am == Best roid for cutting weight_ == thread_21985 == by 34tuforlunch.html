				t3 and clen, avoid DNP. Though you don&#039;t seem to know much about them so I suggest reading up on steroids and the side effects and how they work. If you do know about them then my apologies, use safely and be careful mixing any recreation drugs while on steroids / clen

				Yea, this is going to be my first time using roids and I plan on doing extensive research on the ones that interest me, was just looking for some one to point me in the direction of what I was looking for.

				Honestly though, if you are going to buy roids I would not buy them here. Look for eroids on the regular internet, I have personally used GorillaGear and they are absolutely great, quality gear and good prices + they&#039;re domestic. On that site though you can find 100&#039;s of reviews and such so you can see other peoples experiences. <br /><br />Regardless of who you buy from though, please read up on PCT and anti-estrogens, maybe hcg if you wanna do that too though it&#039;s not required. <br />Some good links if you need a starting point:<br />(Good post on a good first cycle, test-e is mainly a muscle building cycle though, weight loss I&#039;d recommend Cytomel(t3) and Clenbuterol because t3 will help you maintain and keep maybe even gain muscle while you&#039;re on your cut, and the clen is a fat cutting compound.) http://pastebin.com/aT2RvgAv<br />http://www.steroidology.com/forum/anabolic-steroid-forum/595482-standard-pcts.html<br />http://www.eroids.com/forum/steroids-qa/steroid-cycles/easy-quad-pinning-tip if you choose to pin in the quad this is a good tip<br />http://www.steroidology.com/forum/anabolic-steroid-forum/156919-im-ready-gear-check-list.html<br />http://www.steroidology.com/forum/anabolic-steroid-forum/607308-cutting-steroids-mass-adding-compounds.html<br />http://www.eroids.com/ site i buy from<br />Goodluck bro, be safe

				Clenbuterol and T3 seem to be the best for cutting. DO YOUR RESEARCH! This stuff is dangerous, and since you will be taking it daily, get it down to a science. Make sure your diet is in check, not too much or too little. You need alot of protein. <br /><br />From my experience, T3 made me sick to my stomach and fucked up my digestion system for 1-2 weeks after just 4 days...<br /><br />Clenbuterol worked well, but the increased heart rate made it hard to run do cardio, my BPM would go over 200 sometimes... Only use clen once your in shape and &lt;15%BF. I dropped it until I&#039;m down more. <br /><br />Everyone reacts differently, remember to taper up on the clen, and ESPECIALLY the T3. <br /><br />Also, stay away from DNP, losing weight is easier than you think. I lost 10 lbs in the last month without using any hard drugs. <br /><br />Diet is #1, if your diet is good, you could lose weight without exercise, but you still want cardio and to lift to ward off muscle loss and keeping metabolism up. <br /><br />Good luck! Also, 5-HTP and Oxy Elite Pro daily helps me resist urges to pig out on food. <br /><br />
