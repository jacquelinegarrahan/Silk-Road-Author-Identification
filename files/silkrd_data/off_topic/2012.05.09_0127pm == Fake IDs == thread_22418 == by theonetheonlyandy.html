				I guess you just have to look at it like this. <br />How would he or anyone else know the pic you send him is even you...<br />You could be getting a fake ID for someone else. In fact I imagine you could make a business out of it.<br />You take someones picture and cash and send it to the User on SR and he makes the cards for you...<br />Do like 10 or so and Im sure you wouldnt have to worry about him knowing which one was yours..<br />I mean you are using false info on the card so its not like someone can take your pic with the fake info and find you :)
