				Hey SR Forum!<br />I have just recently joined the community and I&#039;m honestly excited about such a revolutionary site.<br /><br />I have always had some solid connections of high quality cocaine and marijuana and figured with a site like this it can be an enjoyable advantage for us all.<br /><br />Just wondering if anyone would be able to offer some solid advice on the ins and outs of the business. such as:<br /><br />-Best way to gain trust from buyers as a new seller<br />-Perhaps offering samples if buyer pays at least the shipping?<br /><br />-Best ways to package and send<br />-Anything to watch out for that may be overlooked in the beginning<br /><br />Basically any advice that would help me become one of the most trusted and respected sellers here on SR from buyers and sellers alike.<br /><br />Id be shipping from the US so I was thinking of limiting orders withing the US until at least I have built an at least decent clientele? <br /><br />This stuff is pretty awesome so I&#039;d, of course, be wanting to prove it. What are the best ways? Any places I can get purity tests? Or should I just let the reviews do the talking? <br /><br /><br />Thanks for any advice you might be able to offer!

				Offer free / cheap samples, especially to reputable members. Ship only via USPS, be sure not to leave fingerprints. Double vac seal the weed.

				That sounds good. Reputable members would already have built solid rapport with the community. Maybe just have them cover shipping?

				Give out some free samples to reputable members or list cheap samples for sale and hope that you get good feedback. You can get a testing kit and post photos of the results (include your SR name and date so we know it isn&#039;t some pic from the internet). Still could be faked but testing results in conjunction with positive feedback should give you a good start. One thing I can say is don&#039;t cut your shit. We have several established cola vendors on here and their stuff is all tested over 70%. You might want to check out the coke vendor thread in the rumor mill forum and order from a couple of those guys to get a feel for your competition. You might also get some ideas about packaging etc.<br /><br />http://www.eztest.com/shop/&nbsp; (testing kits)

				Excellent advice vanilla. I will order the eztest kits immediately.<br />I would love to try some of the competitions product but for some reason my bitcoins haven&#039;t made it to my SR wallet. I sent them yesterday maybe 26 hrs ago. But I&#039;m sure it&#039;s due to the technical difficulties SR is going through at the moment. In the mean time I will get everything else I need.<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback, it&#039;s much appreciated!&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hey Now!!<br />To build up confidence you need some feedback with successful sales. Might I suggest to offer some very low cost (cover your shipping) samples to some of the Forum Mods. Positive feedback from them goes a long way in my opinion. That way they can rate you on speed, stealth, communication, and just as important product. I am into my 4th month on SR and if I see bad things in the forums I will not take the chance. My confidence is built when a seller gets my items out and marks them in transit and it arrives in a timely manner, flag-less, with exactly or better/more than I was expecting. Good luck.
