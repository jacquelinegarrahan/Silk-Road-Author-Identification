				Hallo dear Silkroad users! I am sitting here right now reaaaaaly tripped out on some great acid. It&#039;s a beautiful day the sun in shinning and nothing is wrong. I just came back from sitting at a bird observatory watching the sun as it washes over a sea of green. A sea of life. It was overwhelming so I had to go back home. It makes me so happy that this chemical exists and for all the people who are experiencing its wonders. It is truly a thing of love. Unity. Honestly guys English is not my native language so I might just be typing random words I see fit for this moment. Aaaaaaaah just as I typed that &quot;Forever Young&quot; just started playing through my speakers.<br /><br />Love &lt;3<br /><br />Zookie

				and +1 for you as well! Man I just find it kind of incredible that the media and everyone else makes us drug users look a bunch of unintelligent motherfuckers just sitting in apartments chasing our next high at whatever costs. SilkRoad truly is a wonderful place. I have found so many people alike myself on here. I mean let&#039;s face it most people who circulate drugs are sketchy motherfuckers. But to have found so many other people just like me who do drugs cause they simply enjoy it. That some many others are able to use while still having very good jobs and being seemingly well educated. Makes me happy to know we are more then what my little town makes users out to be.<br /><br />Love to this community &lt;3
