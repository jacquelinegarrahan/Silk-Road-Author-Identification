				Hello, there has recently been a homeland security officer hassling me, telling me that he would have me arrested for tresspassing, loitering, and vagrancy when I was honestly not doing any of these things, he also told me it is illegal to not have identification and he would have me arrested for that too which is complete bullshit. I was wondering in what way I could get back at him? I was going to make a complaint that he threatened to assault and rape me which he did threaten to do ;) but Im not sure what I would have to go through. Would I end up having to go to court and testify to this? How much trouble would I get in If they determine it a false allegation? Can I just call and make a complaint and would they end up just firing him not wanting to deal with the allegation. Help is needed and wanted. Please and thank you

				Crying rape is a completely bitch move on your part. People in positions of &#039;authority&#039; tend to let it go to their heads, perhaps he was just having a bad day. No need to ruin his life for it.

				No he was not having a bad day he has been doing this to me for a couple days now. Second crying rape is not a completely bitch move because its about the only thing I can do to get him removed from homeland security so as to make sure his authoritarian ass knows that he does not run shit. There is complete reason to ruin his life over it considering he makes his living off of wasting tax payer dollars and giving law abiding citizens hell. Maybe if he loses his job and position of authority over this he will rethink his life and come to the conclusion that he is no higher on the totem pole than us ordinary citizens. I have been walking around and enjoying this area of my neighborhood for years and now he comes in and acts like he runs shit and threatens to have me arrested for things which are not illegal and im making a bitch move. He just doesnt like how I look because he&#039;s one of those old conservative military buffs that want an american police state. I think the best thing to do is get him removed from his position of authority so this bullshit doesn&#039;t continue. I didn&#039;t ask what you think about my idea to get his position of authority removed from him so if you have a better idea please share. Peace.

				Let it slide for now.<br /><br />But if he carries on, make a complaint, but tell it how it is. If you say he threatened rape there&#039;s a chance it could go to court. And do you think he&#039;d let it go with all his buddies in LE if you did? It&#039;d cause you more trouble than it would solve

				um, is it cool to pass an anonymous complaint about him actually raping you?&nbsp; he is a cop, that is their game.&nbsp; play by his rules in his court.<br /><br />cops lie.<br /><br />so lie.<br /><br />write a totally fabricate story about how you were raped by a homeland security officer.&nbsp; don&#039;t mention his name or any details, let them &quot;pry&quot; it out of you.&nbsp; tell you story but hide behind tor and random email.&nbsp; say you are afraid or what they will do to you.&nbsp; <br /><br />act like you are only reporting it because you want the next person who gets raped, if they report it, to have some sort of collaborating story.&nbsp; claim you do not want to come out or make an official allegation because you are afraid.<br /><br />it will be funny, even if they don&#039;t link it to him specifically, actually, try not to at first, at least.&nbsp; It would be fanny to read their reaction<br /><br />remember, fuck his life, you think he would give two shits or a fuck if he could have caught you with drugs and destroyed yours?&nbsp; or even killed you?&nbsp; sure he would care, he would be happy as fuck and feel all good about himself..<br /><br />fuck the people that went out of their way to get a job where they get pleasure of destroying people for money.<br /><br />peace, love, unity, respect.&nbsp; these are things they do not live by

				I like what I&#039;m seeing. I am scared to go to court though, I have anxiety issues and&nbsp; so does my mom and it would just kill us both. I like what you said trippyskies, play there game against them&nbsp; ;) and its all good britishperson Im just all shook up because of this. I&#039;m thinking of just saying that I thought he said something about rape but im not sure because he mumbled it but when I asked him if he said that he called me fucked up in the head, which he really said (any repurcusions on him for that?) I don&#039;t want to make an allegation that he threatened to rape me but I do want it to be known that he may of said it so it could be on his record and possibly get him fired. I just don&#039;t know what to do this nigga is turning my neighborhood into a police state&nbsp; :(

				So how did this shit even start. Has he just been giving you guff on the block? Or have you done some shit to piss him off?<br /><br />You should put some time/research into fucking his daughter/s (if he has any).<br /><br />Seriously look them up on FB.. play the slow game, there&#039;s a decent chance you could bang em.

				a wise man once sad that if somebody threatens to rape you, rape them first.&nbsp; if you have a penis.&nbsp; if not, strap on.&nbsp; it&#039;s the rape game<br /><br /><br />but seriously, do the crazy letter thing.&nbsp; &nbsp; Hell, get super creative with your writing, bounce it through a few translatora to fuck the words up a bit.&nbsp; send multiple different ones from &quot;differeent&quot; people claiming crazy acts against them.&nbsp; Fuck, sign a few, like Jose ramirez and shit.&nbsp; &nbsp;just space them out over the next year :)&nbsp; <br /><br />Some jokes take time

				Thanks guys this is great. I should check if he has a daughter. And what more or less happened is there is a of my neighborhood I have been going to the last 5 years to watch the waterway and check out the sunrise/sunset and now this faggot corporation near this area hired this homeland security guy who has constantly been threatening to arrest me but I think he more or less does it to make me leave because the faggot hasnt called them once because he and I both know I&#039;m doing nothing illegal so he just bullshits me and trys to scare me away. All the actual security guards that are hired and work for this faggot corporation have no problem with me though and don&#039;t mind me being there so long as I don&#039;t cross a certain line but its only this one fuckhead that doesnt want me there. Im gonna fuck the shit outta his daughter and send 100&#039;s of letters. Thanks you guys so much&nbsp; ;D
