				For thousands of years China has oppressed her people along with Russia. Both of these despicable countries are scars on the face of the world.<br /><br />The United States has alot to gain by taking China by force and seizing all her assets. The United States should over throw the current Chinese government and free the people. The United States should then help the people live better free lives without the fear of the communist Chinese oppressors. China&#039;s army is purely defensive while the US army is purely offensive and the most powerful army in the world. It would be no problem to take out the Chinese government. Then to pay for the cost of the war the US could require that the new Chinese government sell valuable resources to the US and her allies at 50% market price. The new Chinese government should then give 10% of the money back to the people. The people would come ahead and the important powers in the world would win.<br /><br />Ultimately this describes the US oppressing communism but its for the best. We could completely forget about the recession by exploiting Chinese resources!<br /><br />I luv America. <br /><br />(I also luv Mexico for supplying my country with drugs) Long live the corrupt Mexican government!<br />

				I think a worse problem is the recession. We have the most powerful army in the world and they are also I think as expensive as all the other armies in the world combined. We piss away tons of money on the military. I say use it. China is the best to hit because they are assholes and their country is full of resources. I would like to see us take a few colonies in Africa and take their resources because we all know the Africans are just pissing away everything they have.&nbsp; I know that many people in the government are against Asians while tons of people in the government feel&nbsp; guilty about black people. So it would be easier to convince others in the government to attack China as opposed to an African country. I mean after all we don&#039;t wanna be racist.

				What is it with US Americans thinking they own the entire planet?<br /><br />Lights Out, Obama recently signed the 2012 NDAA, which has some pretty scary provisions about detaining American citizens without trial. That&#039;s pretty much Martial Law right there, and a very clear violation of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. The fact that a government can even do that without people flooding the streets in protest the very next day is enough for a lot of people to call the US government a dictatorship. this will be even more true once SOPA passes. Now, imagine that the countries of the European Union and Mercosur decide to organize a joint army to invade and &quot;free&quot; the USA from Big Bad Barack. This is pretty much the same scenario you&#039;re proposing for China. Wouldn&#039;t you, as an American citizen, feel like your rights, your nationality and your very country are being violated by this foreign aggression? Wouldn&#039;t you think &quot;Who the hell do these people think they are, coming into MY country to fight against MY government? Why don&#039;t they go take care of their own problems? God knows they have enough of those!&quot;?<br /><br />Besides, look at how much Iraq is worse off since your boys went down and tore Saddam a new one. The country&#039;s base infrastructure was completely destroyed in the war, poverty and homelessness skyrocketed, and government corruption is just as high as ever. The only differences from when Saddam was running the show are&nbsp; that it&#039;s a different ethnic group oppressing all the others, and the country as a whole is substantially poorer. Why should we assume that China wouldn&#039;t be the exact same thing?

				I am an American and I served many years in the military. You are making all Americans look like blood thirsty world police with only our own interests at heart. It is essential that America serve as a role model. So that others may follow if they choose. If they choose to live another way this should be allowed unless they show aggression to us or our allies. You dont sound like someone that would have the balls to shoot one of the Chinese oppressors that you speak of. Do you know what its like to have nightmares in the day time? Thats what happens after you shoot and kill someone. Even if that person raise a gun and was preparing to kill you.....after you kill them your life is never the same. My entire world changed after I killed my first man. I have watched close friends go crazy after they shot an enemy that was preparing to kill them. It takes a special kind of person to maintain his sanity after committing a murder. Ultimately it is murder and you will come to that conclusion even if the government gives you a pat on the back.

His views are warped but that doesn&#039;t mean you get to say his post is trolling.<br /><br />Additionally, this is the off topic section of the forums. That leads me to believe that anything can be posted here right? I dont know forum etiquette since I usually dont use the internet for socialization purposes. This is the first website that I have used for anything resembling social purposes. <br /><br />Despite this post being questionable at best its much better reading than FaceBook or Twitter posts. Talk about &quot;trolling&quot; or w/e. Those entire sites need to be erased.

				I think the OP needs to forget about China and Russia and start looking at how Uncle Sam is quietly enslaving Americans.<br /><br />The Internet has paradoxically supplied both the chains -and the tools to liberty ...and that&#039;s what makes living in the 21st Century so exciting!<br /><br />Loving America need not include a love of the US Government (be it Democrat or Republican Tea Party or Socialist) the US Govt. machine is out of control. <br /><br />The question is, how will Americans retrieve the idea and ideals of America from big government and big internet before it is lost as our fathers remembered it?<br /><br />I&#039;m not American, but like many westerners, I hail from a country that is heavily influenced, allied to, and hosts US troops on our soil. For the most part, I still prefer US world-hegemony to the alternative, and as such these realities give me a platform on which to comment upon the crossroads America is fast approaching.<br /><br />

				As a young American who has been to China, I think that it&#039;s ridiculous that you would want to just march into China and force them into doing what we want.&nbsp; It&#039;s like &quot;we owe China a lot of money, so lets walk in and bitch slap them to justify us robbing them blind and refusing to pay them back&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know man, the last thing we need is another war.<br /><br />Also, some people here have posted about not knowing anything about the Chinese government.&nbsp; When I was there, my tour guide openly talked about the shitty parts about his country, when we weren&#039;t monitored by the government.&nbsp; He knew which areas were monitored and which weren&#039;t ( to an extent ).&nbsp; Not only that, but there aren&#039;t any armed guards in my area, but in China there were plenty of people walking around with machine guns and shit.&nbsp; The people there are terribly poor, and are desperate for a dollar.&nbsp; I had beggars walk up to me and take my trash just for the hopes of recycling it.&nbsp; The beggars were so abundant that every time I would exit a bus, thirty or so Chinese would storm the entrance to the bus in hopes of selling something to us.<br /><br />The Chinese people aren&#039;t happy with their government, and I think if America was to go to war with them, they would have a revolution.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying I know everything, but I have seen plenty of China, and the people are not happy.&nbsp; Many of them work 60+ hours a week for shit wages, or are jobless trying to kiss the ass of tourists to make some money.<br /><br />I think America has it&#039;s problems, but in general it isn&#039;t that bad compared to other countries.&nbsp; I just wish more people would act on NDAA + SOPA, but no one wants to throw the first stone.&nbsp; I have contemplated about leaving college to start paramilitary training, but I&#039;m not sure if the next American revolution will be violent.

				I like when people say they love america. It really is silly and makes no sense in itself. Which part of america do you love? child pornography or murder? unconstitutional practices by an oppressive government, or the fact that the president is allowed to lie to the american citizens and brag about it while being cheered on? The country is so divided, it makes no sense at all to &#039;love&#039; it as if its one united entity. This isnt WWF where you can love the whole organization. Our civil battles are real, and as far as us real Americans are concerned, the US government has chose to oppose us, its obvious from their daily actions, up to and including the mind warping techniques that has their citizens thinking its ok to drive tanks through foreign yards for no reason.
