				So, after hearing a lot from people on the internet and uni mates irl, I decided that i&#039;d jump onto the onion network to see silk road for myself, i&#039;ve been having trouble finding dealers around my area so I figured i&#039;d just see what it&#039;s like, prices etc. I was pretty disspointed to find that 2g cheese costs about £30, I could get 2g for £20 (and probably a little more if my old dealer wasn&#039;t busted a month ago). To top it off the hastle of getting bitcoins and then transferring it over to an SR account is a lot of trouble, and being a student means that most of my money is gone in a fortnight.<br /><br />So why do you guys use SR? Do you have any dealers? Do you deal yourself?<br /><br />It&#039;s just questions i&#039;d like answered, getting bitcoins is a pain and takes a long time when I could just go out on the street in an attempt spot my own stoner kin.

				1. Can&#039;t find the quality or selection of cannabis present on SR just looking around on the street. You may be able to, dunno, but not me/here.<br /><br />2. No idea where to get acid locally whatsoever.<br /><br />3. Liking the community so far.<br /><br />Chronological order, not order of importance.

				Three reasons really..<br /><br />&nbsp;1. Customers eager to purchase abound here :D<br />&nbsp;2. Buying exotic psychedelics here is cheaper and less trouble than a lab build-out, synthesis/extraction and so forth.<br />&nbsp;3. Some typical IRL dealers are obnoxious socially and working via email and BTC isolates me from their crazy.

				Marijuana and cocaine are easy to come by around my location, molly is a little hard at times, and as for other things like psychedelics it&#039;s damn near impossible.<br />Reasons I use SR:<br /><br />1. Most dealers around my area don&#039;t know how to handle themselves well and keep a tight business. Also, not a lot of them are as professional as how I would like to see.<br /><br />2. Drugs like mdma are usually never pure, it&#039;s always mixed with some RC which I don&#039;t like with my mdma. As for weed, man, it&#039;s just one BS after the other like people selling mids but saying it&#039;s afgan kush or some other exotic. Not much trustworthy dealers with that but luckily I have a steady supply.<br /><br />3. Who wouldn&#039;t want drugs delivered straight to them? Haha<br /><br />4. It reduces the danger of going out and having to find a new dealer which in turn could lead to some problems and/or violent situations.<br /><br />5. Before I buy a drug on SR I could review the ratings of said items and see how other people liked it.<br /><br />6. I do occasionally sell to my friends whenever I buy psychedelics on here in low bulk since it&#039;s so dry over here, low price as well so everyones happy ^_^<br /><br />7. The quality of the drugs on SR a lot of times are just amazing.<br /><br />I guess that&#039;s all? Ha, but I am interested in other members thoughts about this subject.

				1. Quality of products. If you can find 84% pure Bing in the U.K I&#039;ll print you out a certificate and a medal, everything on here is by and large top quality. <br />2. Focus on customer service. There ain&#039;t no jacking on SR, dealers run this shit like a mail order business so you cut out the cut drugs, jackings, waiting on street corners and having to lick your dealers ass to get the good shit.<br />3. LOL BitCoins are easy to get, takes about an hour to learn and maybe 3 hours to get any amount you want. <br />4. The range....come on mate, this place is like a fucking candy shop. Everything you want under 1 roof. <br />5. You can pay for drugs anonymously. <br />6. It almost takes risk of 5-O completely out the equation.<br />7. There is more information on SR and the SR forum than you will ever learn from the bullshit rumor-factory that normal dealers give you. People know what they are talking about here, otherwise they just don&#039;t get very far.<br />8. You can learn how to streamline your business and find other things like false identities, I myself teach advanced money laundering of digital currency.<br />9. You can vet every single vendor on here before you buy anything via their ratings and not have to just go on &quot;Yeah that geeza is well good&quot; like IRL.<br />10. You can easily buy bulk here to sell IRL and probably nail your local competition in terms of quality. <br />11. Here your funds are protected via the escrow system.<br />12. You want to get technical? Easy to find chemists here, I found one already and I&#039;ve been here coming up to three months.<br />13. You want to set up a lab, you can easily get the equipment/chemicals here (I can supply things like Double-Jacket reactors, centrifuges, extractor ventilation, glassware and lab chemicals etc, so can others too).<br />14. You want specialist electronics? You can get them here.<br />15. You want to learn how to be digitally secure, you can get that info here for free. <br /><br />Need I say more????

				I prefer Sr because it&#039;s cheaper then it is where i live (the whole country)&nbsp; and i think quality is better, all my dealers have quit is in jail or is complete douchebags that i don&#039;t want to associate with. And of course the wide array of drugs. Sr is awesome!
