				I, too, love SR and the way (most) vendors care about their clients. I also do some deals one HackBB and BMR, but that&#039;s always like a step into into unknown.<br />Of course there are black sheep here, too, I hve lost 200$ to the most recent scam here, well, ok, but I have a lot of transactions where I got more product, better quality and/or some extras, which more than make it up for me.<br /><br />And since I have begun to sell some things myself, I appreciate the time and effort the vendors take for god packaging.<br /><br />I only wish that there were more mid-quality weed available in EU, and a broader variety of K, which I have learned to love in the last months<br /><br />Total transactions: 79<br />Total spent: ฿1522.48<br />Refund rate: 0%<br />Auto-finalize rate: 0%<br />Member for: 6 months<br /><br /><br />cheers, and thanks to all the good vendors and of course the SR staff (which I might contribute to in the new future by buying some &quot;common sense&quot;, that&#039;s something I know I need and imo a great idea)<br />

				I don&#039;t think a &quot;best buyer&quot; is a person who spent a lot of money here.. i think a &quot;best buyer&quot; is someone who:<br />1. Wait at least 13-15 days before bothering a vendor with questions like &quot;Where my package is?&quot;<br />2. Pay the seller as soon as the drug is received and the quality is tested.<br />3. Discuss on the forums with others about what drugs they like, how to use them safely or just to help some new buyers.<br />4. Is always polite and courteous when he send PM to others.<br /><br />Have a nice week everyone !

I want high quality drugs, as fast as can, so i always pay when package arrives.<br />Most young people doesn´t honour this.Maeby they think they buy a music cd on AMAZON.Most&nbsp; have no respect and no payment morale.<br />In some countrys&nbsp; you get killed if you don´t pay your stuff.If you bought drugs yesterday, and you wont pay them today, than tomorrow you are dead. Hard but fair.<br />For future i wish we find a good way to protect SR and detect scammers and eliminate them. Only happy buyer´s and happy seller´s.<br />Let the nickel roll.<br />Nowadays i buy all my drugs here and i never want to buy anything on the streets again, only if its same price and quality.Silk Road is a lifetime partnership and friendship and i hope to buy here for the rest of my days.<br />We all have to pay tribute to Silk Road. Remember the old day´s where you driving miles to your dealer, always police on your neck, maeby loosing driver license, get arrested and woke up on a police station ...<br />Some people&nbsp; forgot this&nbsp; and doesn´t&nbsp; appreciate.<br />
