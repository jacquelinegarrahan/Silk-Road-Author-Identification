				Just curious what do you guys prefer? <br /><br />I&#039;ve always leaned towards the night rather then the morning, something about the sun rising always gave such closer to an amazing night.<br /><br />

				I think night trips are better because you usually have more time/less worries at night so you can focus more on the trip than life.<br />Drugs are the best virtual reality haha

				I prefer dosing during the day, early in the morning is best. That way you don&#039;t fuck up your sleep cycle.<br />That&#039;s the only downside to night tripping for me...back when I lived at home, I would dose acid at night, usually around 10-11 pm. I would always have amazing trips, but I would feel really tired the next day because that&#039;s a while to go with no sleep for me. I would sleep amazing the following night though.<br /><br />Holly is right about the introspection. When I would trip at night, it was usually pretty fucking amazing, because I would be in my bed the whole time, having really deep insights and introspection. No distractions, nothing you need to do or act sober for, nothing to worry about. Just you and the mind. ;)

				Depends on your lifestyle. If you want to trip with friends and they&#039;re more available during night/day, then that answers it for you. If you want to trip alone, then pick a time that you&#039;ll have the lowest chance to need to function: days off of work (or even the night before a day off of work, if it&#039;s a long-lasting psych), days off of school, that sort of thing. Considering the above and all things being equal, I prefer trips, rolls, etc. at night. A fully dark room at night with rave lights going is always better than a bright mid-morning room with the same lights. And for me, I have to have some visual stimulation if I&#039;m beyond functional, but everyone&#039;s different. Though going for a walk during a bright day on a mild psych can be fun, too.

				i like to trip at night one big reason is cuz people are alot less likely to stop by and add some wierdness to my trip ( like a neighbor or something the strangest shit happens when i trip for sum reason) i also like to time my trips to big thunder storms. sitting on a covered porch when its hailing and lightning with strong wind may sound kinda dumb but its an awesome experience the lightning is so vivid and intense and you feel the thunder through your whole body, you can really feel the power of mother nature. and watching the storm from arrival to leaving and clearing up during the day is cool too but the night gives its a little extra.... magic

				When&nbsp; I am with friends, I enjoy dosing right when we wake up after a communal breakfast or lunch :) But, I like to dose for sunsets, too, and enjoy tripping in the night. Someone mentioned more introspection at night and I feel that way because at night is when I trip by myself, usually. Watching the sun set on the dunes of the beach while really &#039;in it&#039; is incredible!!! Watching the sun rise is pretty cool, too. Honestly, it all comes down to who you may or may not be with, and what you are trying to get out of it. the advantage of dosing right when you wake up is being thrown into the experience as soon as you are regaining consciousness. It&#039;s awesome! A sun rise / set is always beautiful, though!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />edit: i agree about the talk of less chance of non-trippers fucking with you at night, but my current location is rather private. i can smoke bowls and dance and be at the beach very privately even in the day time :D but i totally agree that one should avoid contact with &#039;reality&#039; (non tripping world / public places *especially crowds..these can freak me out...*) if they are really trying to &#039;get into it&#039;&nbsp; 8)

While my dorm was nice, I never felt very safe outside of it on high doses. Here, no problem. Woods surround my abode and the beach is a quick 2 minute stroll away. I walk through an extended path of an almost tree arch for a bit before the beach. Simply magical&nbsp; ::) The dunes above it are a perfect area for the sunset, as they are quite high up. The sun rises over the beach, too :) While the city and public life are cool, I have found it very refreshing out here. ALmost transcendental. I feel like Thoreau out here sometimes :D Also, its not too far off the beaten path. Plenty of kids within a decent distance. Going to a rave this weekend&nbsp; ;D EVERYONE COME ON DOWN :P

				I have always tripped at night by default I guess. Whether it be due to work commitments during the day, waiting for friends to be available, or waiting for the people I live with to go to bed.<br /><br />I enjoy standing in the backyard and looking up at the sky. The clouds look so amazing!<br /><br />I&#039;d like the trip during the day more often just to see what it&#039;s like. Nighttime can sometimes feel a bit scary/evil to me if I&#039;m tripping really hard.

				Conditions must be perfect if I am to trip during the day, such as dark grey rain clouds enveloping the sky and eclipsing the sun casting a blue-ish/green hue over everything. I also prefer heavy-rains during my day trips, there&#039;s just something about how vivid and clean the earth looks to me while looking through the rain. It gives me chills!&nbsp; ;D Not to give away to much info about myself, but you haven&#039;t lived until you&#039;ve smelled Arizona rain. A certain plant grows out here in the desert that releases a marvelous smell during those April showers!<br /><br /><br />Normally, I&#039;m a night tripper though.

				I&#039;m a day tripper when it comes to psychedelics. I enjoy the sunlight way too much to pass it by. On dissociatives, I prefer tripping at night. My ideal trip starts with LSD at about 3-4 P.M., culminates with a beautiful sunset at the end of the come-up and then gets mixed with a few bumps of ketamine for a calm and introspective come-down in the dark. Either that, or I drop acid in the morning and make it a family day. You just can&#039;t beat being surrounded by the people you love for the best come-down ever.
