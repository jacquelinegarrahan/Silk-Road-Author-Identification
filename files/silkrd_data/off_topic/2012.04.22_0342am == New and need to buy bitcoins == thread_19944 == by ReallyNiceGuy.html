				I&#039;m pretty lost here. I want to order some things, and I loaded a debit card with 120 dollars for anonymity, but where can I exchange the money for bitcoins? <br /><br />EDIT: It is not a MoneyPak.

				There are many paths you can take that all lead to the same bitcoins, but at different costs, durations, and difficulties.&nbsp; For a first time buyer, I personally would recommend going to a store that sells the little cardboard-esque MoneyPak reload cards.&nbsp; Note that you do NOT want to buy one of the prepaid Greendot debit cards, but one of the reload cards instead.&nbsp; They cost $4.95 to load money onto and many MoneyPak to bitcoin exchange vendors operate here on SR.<br /><br />I personally trust and recommend BTCpal for MoneyPak transactions.&nbsp; There are many other exchange service vendors, but I do not feel comfortable recommending a vendor I haven&#039;t personally used.&nbsp; I&#039;ve had many transactions of over a hundred dollars with BTCpal without any issues, and they offer one of the lowest rates on SR and a very fast turnaround time.&nbsp; Unless their profile lists that they have a backlog or are not taking orders at the current moment, you can be assured that you will have bitcoins in under 24 hours in most cases.<br /><br />As a real World example, I just recently placed an order with BTCpal during one of the busiest times in recent history here on SR, the 420 sale.&nbsp; Not only did BTCpal deliver my coins quicker than expected and in time for the sale, they did so while dealing with a terrible personal issue of having a close relative&#039;s funeral to attend.&nbsp; In my history with BTCpal, they have always delivered even when faced with personal hardships and insanely large backlogs.&nbsp; In fact, when the favorite vendors feature was unveiled, BTCpal was the very first vendor I added to my very short list of favorites.<br /><br />Good luck, I won&#039;t say it&#039;s easy to complete your first order here on SR but once you complete the first one it is fairly easy from there.&nbsp; Hang in there, don&#039;t hesitate to come back in here and ask for more help, and most importantly good luck and stay safe!&nbsp; I feel confident saying that you will likely find SR a good home base with a vibrant community of intelligent people with very diverse areas of expertise.&nbsp; Oh, and we have some pretty cool drugs here for sale too&nbsp; ;).

				BTCpal, Sugar mama, etc. Even some vendors do it from time to time. <br /><br />Check the money section on Silk road&#039;s marketplace for vendors doing moneypak to BTC. <br /><br />Just be careful and read up about each in the Rumor mill section. <br /><br />And if you&#039;re not in such a hurry, you can try get-bitcoin.com. They only charge 5%. And you can deposit cash into their back accounts at Chase and Bank of America. Turn around time, in my experience with them has been anywhere from 2 hours to 18 hours. Sometimes it can take ore than 24 hours. But if it does, they will refund you the 5% fee. <br /><br />Check them out on the clearnet. <br /><br />Another is Bitinstant.com. They can also do cash depoits for BTC. But you have to send the BTC to an intermediary like MT Gox account before forwarding it to your SR account. But if you go this route, you can get you BTC in under 3 hours I&#039;m told.

				Excellent points and advice, Sonic. +1 Karma. <br /><br />@ reallyniceguy, possibly. But you might need to buy something small and then get the remaining cash value out of it at the register.
