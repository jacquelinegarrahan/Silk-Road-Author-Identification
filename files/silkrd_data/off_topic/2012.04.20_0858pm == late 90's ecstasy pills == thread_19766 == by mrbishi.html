				I first popped in 97, the pills were weak for ages. Then in 98, Mitsubishis. Tight tall little pills that did the business. Now, 14 years later, for the first time in a very long time they are back in the form of white speakers. I assume I&#039;m not the first to notice how good these are but I feel I need to let anyone who had the original mitsi&#039;s know that they are back.<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;bish&quot;

Whereas with pure mdma, the comedowns are just normal.<br /><br />Do you prefer pills to powder/crystal or are you just a rave enthusiast?&nbsp; 8)

				The majority of pills are MD now, at least they are in the EU. Check out the results on pill reports: from December 2010 the number of MD pills reported increased dramatically whilst the horrible mCPP/TFMPP pills which plagued the EU market from 2006 began to disappear. <br /><br />Every old raver is convinced that drugs just aren&#039;t as good as they used to be, forgetting that 15 years of caning it causes some of the magic to disappear. I hear people in their 30&#039;s reminiscing about &#039;those mercedes in Ibiza in &#039;98&#039; and people in their 40&#039;s who swear that MD powder just isn&#039;t as good as the apples they has at Castelmorton in &#039;92. <br /><br />Having said that, my parents say the same about acid- &quot;that windowpane got really bad in &#039;76&quot;, no shit- you took it every weekend&nbsp; ::)

If you roll one night then roll again 2 days later then of course it will be less effective than if you waited a month.. but.. even if you waited 6 months between doing it, the brain &quot;remembers&quot; how to process the MD and tolerance can&#039;t be escaped. Ultimately we are all cursed to this fate.<br /><br />Piracetam? Tell me more man, what&#039;s it like etc. Is it very similar to MDMA?<br /><br />

				Piracetam is....<br />I could waffle on but as I&#039;m not a neuroscientist, I&#039;ll just be regurgitating stuff I&#039;ve read in books and journals. The wiki article is pretty good.<br />en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam<br /><br />If you take it every day it works as an effective cognitive enhancer &amp; has neuroprotective properties. <br />No idea how it works but it definitely helps maintain the magic. I take 4g a day and stop taking it a couple of days before I plan on taking MD. <br />It&#039;s so cheap &amp; safe it&#039;s worth trying&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;m going to swap it for pramiracetam soon to see if it&#039;s more effective.<br />en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pramiracetam<br /><br />

				My partner and I use to get a shit load of rolls that were nothing but 5-MEO-DiPT and me never having had real ecstacy thought this is what it was. We sold them like hot cakes too (not knowing they weren&#039;t real X but they were the best pills around which basically goes to show you that almost all pills have no MDMA in them anymore if you are in the U.S.)<br /><br />I still haven&#039;t had MDMA (got DopeBoy order coming :) but 5 meo effect is pretty spot on with how ecstacy has always been described to me. Everything feels great, and fucking is absolutely the best and you can do it the whole night and every thrust sends shivers down your spine and feels like you are getting off. Music is amazing, and you do get slight visuals like the room always seems smokey and colors are different.<br /><br />They were these orange german Shepards, and yellow and blue doves. We would pick up like 500 or so in a major metropilis city (huge like top 5 biggest cities) and they were very well renowned there, so that is why we got them. Everything was done through a network from a gang (I am not affiliated but my partner was considered an O.G.)<br /><br />Pretty fun times especially me being white and seeing how the black culture is.

				I have no idea what dosage they were, but I think they had a pretty high dose of 5-Meo in them because one was enough and two was too much.<br /><br />It is psychadelic as far as colors, sounds, and tracers, but nothing like morphing walls that you would get on a 3-4 grams of mushrooms. You don&#039;t get that weird feeling in public that shrooms give. I went to the strip club plenty of times and wore sun glasses the whole time and had a blast and felt like I was in a Hollywood movie strip club lol
