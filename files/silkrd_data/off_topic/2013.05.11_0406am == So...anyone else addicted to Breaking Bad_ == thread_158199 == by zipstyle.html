				Funny that breaking bad was the biggest factor that motivated me to try meth! But it also made me discover my interest an talents for chemistry, so changed my studies to chemistry.

Walt tells his wife he&#039;s a meth dealer. Walt moves to the superlab to work for Gus. Jesse gets out of rehab and cooks his own meth. Hank links Jesse to the blue meth. Hank almost catches Walt and Jesse in the RV at the junkyard. Gale is introduced as Walt&#039;s assistant at the lab. Jesse kills gale. Shoots him in the head after knocking on his door. <br /><br />Gale was a cool guy.<br /><br />Why would they have &quot;the best pure meth&quot; be blue?

				The show is good but it would be better if it was more realistic. They make a big deal about what they call a &quot;p2p cook&quot; when it&#039;s just a simple amalgum reduction on p2p. Then they have Gale the expert chemist who doesn&#039;t know how to run a simple amalgum? What?!

				Gus is such an amazing character, has so much depth. When you learn about his past in Mexico, you feel like loving him immediatly, yet later.....That scene with Don Eladio was great.&nbsp;
