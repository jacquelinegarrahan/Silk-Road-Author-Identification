				Hey all, seems bad times may be upon me and I know you&#039;re the best people to ask for advice, and hopefully people in the same position as myself (or could well be at any time), will learn something from this.<br /><br />Here&#039;s my situation. I&#039;m a buyer only, in the UK. My bank accounts MAY be checked by police for something non-drug related, nor scam related (for anyone who thought by this point they had a smart arse reply ;p). My bank account will show transfers to Intersango and mtgox on a regular basis. Will they question this? I know it&#039;s not illegal to buy bitcoins, but would the evidence of me buying BTC give them enough reason to delve deeper?<br /><br />What happens when they do chase it up? Can they trace the BTC exchange transfer to an actual SR account? Can they get into that account without my login details?<br /><br />I&#039;d love to delete my account. I did search on the forums for info but all the threads that were asking for their accounts to be deleted, never had a reply. So I guess I&#039;m shit out of luck there? At the worst, they&#039;ll only have a record of what I bought over the past 3 months, which is only cannabis and some blues.<br /><br />I admit I&#039;ve been stupid and sloppy. I did straight transfers from bank to exchange to SR account. Probably &#039;cause I thought they&#039;d never bust me for drugs. I never thought something else would trigger events leading to the shit I MAY be in. So my advice to those who think the same as I did, please be more careful. It doesn&#039;t have to be drugs related for them to check your bank account.<br /><br />Anyway, would love to hear your advice on this. I&#039;m constantly thinking of what I can say and what I can&#039;t (obviously not without speaking to a solicitor first, when that time comes). It&#039;s driving me nuts!

Good luck my friend!<br /><br />- The Consultant<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Another point is how will Police gain access to your silk road account history? :) unless you have your username and password written down they will only ever have a btc address which links to the website silk road. Silk Road however is not illegal and they won&#039;t have proof unless they literally find the substances that you ordered. Now i am no expert feel free to prove me wrong but i just don&#039;t hold any information on my PC or written anywhere about my btc addresses etc and as The Consultant said transfer it to a wallet then to SR and delete the wallet you used :) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And of course, if you ARE ever going to save data to incriminate you, put it on a usb key which is encrypted, with a file which is encrypted, with a file in the file, and within that file a hidden encrypted directory, and within THAT... your data. All with truecrypt. All with keyfiles. Paranoia is great.<br /><br />- The Consultant<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Great idea, didn&#039;t think to do this however will be now :) thanks <br /><br />CJ<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Glad to be of help my friend!<br /><br />- The Consultant

				There&#039;s nothing wrong with buying and selling BTC.&nbsp; People use it to trade for legal goods all the time.&nbsp; Hiding your trail of transactions is the challenge.&nbsp; I hear a lot about how it&#039;s very difficult to trace a transaction but very difficult is not impossible even with tumblers.
