				I just wanted to take a moment and thank the community and the DPR for giving us the opportunity to have this site, <br /><br />&nbsp;Honestly, and embarrassingly with out SR this past month, I do not know how I would have taken care of my family. We still have a hard month ahead before our normal payroll starts ( messed up payroll system&nbsp; &gt;:( ) and I know that SR will put food on my table and keep a roof over the heads of my children. We were both cut from our programs and only one of us has been able to find employment<br />&nbsp;( un-employment has run out) ... In reality recently this has just been pocket change to most people,&nbsp; I just don&#039;t have the capital to make large buys for the investment. ( I have market for it to move)&nbsp; but even the small amounts have really saved us! <br /><br />&nbsp;I know we will get back to the status we once were at and SR will help us get there.. I will get larger buys soon, once the capital is there. In the mean time smaller buys are whats keeping us a float. <br /><br />&nbsp;So..... THANK YOU DPR&nbsp; :-* for giving us an outlet to be able to make money when we were at a dead end. Thank you for working so hard to keep the attack at bay and the site up and going! If nothing else you are keeping a family safe, feed and going in their time of need.
