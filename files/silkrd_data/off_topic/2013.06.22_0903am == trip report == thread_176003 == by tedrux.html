				she didn&#039;t immediately leave but eventually she did. I puked in a puddle and the cops let me lay in it. i vaguely remember hearing a voice through the vent and not wanting to answer because i didn&#039;t know if it was real. it was though. i found out on later visits to county that the ladies holding tank is next to the dudes in one area and they can talk through the vents. I drifted in and out of consciousness, exhausted from running for hours . when I&#039;d come too Id see m1 who got popped too. L&#039;s dad bailing him out. M1 threatening me , reading his lips he tells he he got arrested just so wed be in gen pop together and he could kill me. I sat in jail after that for a while. it lead to more violations because of drinking and long ass probation sentance .<br />it was a hell of a ride. it showed me many things. that woman really could change me- really could make me move mountains. she made a fat boy run as fast as long as he could and thats a real start because I NEVER show determination when it means hard work.
