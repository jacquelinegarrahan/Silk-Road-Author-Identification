				hey yalll&nbsp; :D<br /><br />as the topig says, my girlfriend dont like me doing drugs, but she is ok with me smoking, and im happy about that..<br />My pased grilfriends didnt like that either... But i want to do some drugs now and then, if I do drugs I usualy cant sleep the following night, and its no fun just pretending to be sleeping next to my gilrfriend.. what drugs can i take in small amount urly in the day, come home and night and go to sleep, without my girl noticing?<br />Ive try to do this with som lines of coke and that worked ok, but coke is a bit boring.. Small amounts of mdma works fine to, but only if shes drinking to... any toughts?<br />&nbsp;;D

				Hi dude,<br /><br />That is a sticky situation you find yourself in and I have been there myself once before. In my experience, drug users and non users are not compatible as a couple unless the one that doesn&#039;t take drugs is cool with the other dabbling every now and then. If you&#039;re hiding your drug use, she will eventually cop on to what you&#039;re up to and this, in turn, will lead to accusations of you lying to her and she will be wondering how long you were doing it for.<br /><br />When the situation happened to me, I laid my cards on the table and told her where I stand and that my drug use is part of who I am, and that she either had to accept that or else it was over. I was prepared for the possible outcome of her saying &quot;OK, goodbye&quot;, which she did. Best thing I ever did was get rid of her because I hate hiding what i&#039;m up to at parties etc and I don&#039;t like someone else dictating what I can and can&#039;t do. Now I am with a girl who also likes to take drugs and everything is hunky dory :)<br /><br />If you really like her, I guess you&#039;ll have to figure out what you are going to do. I wish you luck.<br /><br />Psy

				Grow some balls?<br /><br />Why doesn&#039;t your gf like you doing drugs? I think you need to adress that and be realistic with her. I&#039;ve went through a lot of women this past year and the ones i&#039;ve had the best time with are the ones that don&#039;t care about my use and partake with me. I&#039;m not saying go out and find you a hooker that knows how to party. (Unless that&#039;s your thing.) I&#039;m saying it would be eaiser to be up front about it and a lot more fun if she was up at night with you lol. <br /><br />Otherwise you can hide your habit. I got pretty good at hiding mine with two of my ex girlfriends. (I thought that i was going to be with them forever blah blah blah.) It was really easy for me to hide most of my habits. Also, if you are taking them when you&#039;re not around your girl. How would she notice? That part confuses me. Obviously don&#039;t use things that linger on clothing, breath, or change your gait.<br /><br />Good luck living your double lifestyle 00 agent.

				I understand your desire to carry on using drugs but you need to balance this against how your girlfriend is going to feel, she certainly doesn&#039;t approve of it. We don&#039;t like to hear it but people who don&#039;t do drugs ALWAYS look down on those who do, it&#039;s wrong, but it&#039;s just the way it is. This would be a guess, I don&#039;t think the legality of the drugs your using is the issue, she&#039;s more concerned (and insecure) your not happy enough with her to not do drugs. Although, in YOUR mind this is not the case, we&#039;re talking about what&#039;s going on in HER mind. <br /><br />In relationships, I personally believe it&#039;s very important for both partners to be honest with one another, and do not attempt to conceal, hide, or lie. Dishonesty is not a solid foundation for a relationship, in most instances lies catch up eventually, causing the relationship to breakdown. It&#039;s not easy finding the right partner, but females that accept and use drugs moderately like yourself exist.<br /><br />The other option is for you to give up altogether to please her, which I think is wrong, she should love you for you. I don&#039;t believe in manipulation in a relationship, and if she gets what she wants with this issue, she may start to enforce her opinion into other areas of your life. It&#039;s going to be a tough decision, but if you love her, you have to do whatever you feel is the right choice, best of luck to you :)

I was in a situation like you about 10 years back. I was a recreational user, my girlfriend was so very anti-drug (she had OD&#039;ed at some point before I met her and had to go to the ER) and because I wanted to be with her I gave up that portion of my lifestyle, left it all behind. <br /><br />Fast forward 10 years, and after getting married and having a kid and suffering through a bad relationship and bad marriage we&#039;re getting divorced. And Princess was right - it didn&#039;t stop with her opinion on drugs, she was just a very stubborn and opinionated person on a lot of things, and she could never open her mind to view things in different ways. It became a major point of argument for us.<br /><br />And now I&#039;m back here on SR, getting my recreational use on after a 10-year drought.<br /><br />But since you&#039;re asking for help on what kind of drugs you can take... you can always bump ketamine in bed next to her, lol. You can k-hole while she gets her sleep on!<br />

				Don&#039;t change who you are for anyone. But don&#039;t go around taking drugs behind her back and lying to her face, that&#039;s not good.<br />If drugs are important to you and she is not going to change her mind on the issue, then you&#039;ve only really got one option.

				I am sorry for your dilemma . I was in a similar one years ago.What i learned and finally accepted was that i could rely on drugs and that i could not rely on a woman. All i had to do was read the label on the side of the bottle and i new what to expect. With women men will never know. It is part of the mystic of the female gender. Show me a man who say&#039;s they know what a woman wants and i&#039;ll show you a fool .

				I had a GF similar to this and I eventually ended it due to her being a pathological liar and freaking out since I promised myself in 5th Grade after graduating from DARE that I was going to try all drugs..<br /><br />But now I actually sell to her&nbsp; so things kinda went full circle and on a side note she&#039;s an idiot and is going to fry her serotonin receptors before she&#039;s 25 but thats her issue haha

				Don&#039;t listen to em. Girls are more important than drugs. <br /><br />If you can snatch some alone time here and there, enjoy it. That&#039;s what men do.
