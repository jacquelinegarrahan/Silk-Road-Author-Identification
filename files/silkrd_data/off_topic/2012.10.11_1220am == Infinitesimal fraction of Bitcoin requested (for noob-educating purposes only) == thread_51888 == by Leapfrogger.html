				Hey, I hate to be &quot;that guy,&quot; but would any kind soul be willing to send this highly motivated noob an infinitesimal fraction of a Bitcoin so he can play around with it before making his first, medium-sized Bitinstant deposit tomorrow? Mostly I just wanna see that the coins will in fact show up on my torified Bitcoin client before I send a couple hundred hard-earned dollars careening through the ether.<br /><br />Bitcoin Faucet has been &quot;under repair&quot; since the weekend, and a similar site I found wants my cell phone number for 0.01 BTC. If there are other &quot;faucet&quot; sites that don&#039;t require me getting spammed with Bitcoin-related texts for the rest of my natural life, please let me know and I&#039;ll just go there!<br /><br />My address: 1K8xm8TBR5H5fmVHXnYn9NZiGZn7NGAfS1<br />

				CaptainMal, thank you for popping my Bitcoin cherry! Okay, that sounded a little weird. But yeah, I just saw your 0.01 BTC arrive and the network is currently confirming it... I&#039;m shocked by how excited I am, lol. Like, I can&#039;t believe this shit actually works.<br /><br />Apparently I can&#039;t give karma until I have 100 posts, so you&#039;ll have to wait. Thanks again. I now feel I&#039;m ready to take the plunge.&nbsp; :)

				Ah, that does make me feel better!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Thanks for the advice. I&#039;ve got a handle on PGP, though it was tricky at first. A dear friend of mine actually made his first couple of SR purchases without using PGP at all- oops! I brought him up to speed on it and now he&#039;ll &quot;shop safe&quot;, hopefully.<br /><br />Bitcoin required a bit more time to wrap my head around than PGP, so again, it&#039;s very reassuring to see that the thing actually works. Amazing times we&#039;re living in...
