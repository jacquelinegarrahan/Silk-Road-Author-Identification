				I&#039;d like to know about any spiritual experiences with drugs like DMT, mescaline, etc. What happened and what did you learn? I&#039;d like to learn from the knowledge of experienced users.

				While I&#039;m sure there is some great insight in these forums, you should probably read up on www.erowid.org a bit, it&#039;s a great resource with some excellent trip reports.<br /><br />Your question as it stands is a bit broad.&nbsp; I believe it was Strassman that described the three elements that determine your experience.&nbsp; Set, setting, drug.&nbsp; Your mindset, the environment you&#039;re in and the drug(s) you are on.&nbsp; Keep this in consideration when planning a trip if you want to get the most out of it.&nbsp; Also, I hope it goes without saying but be safe.<br /><br />sorry if this isn&#039;t quite the response you were looking for, but I hope it helps.

				I was a &quot;devout&quot; atheist before I took shrooms a few times and read a few books by a modern russian philosopher. Now I&#039;m a pretty strong believer in karma. It&#039;s a simple answer, but it&#039;s hard to explain spirituality.

				Back in 1985-1987, LSD helped change my view of life. It&#039;s all spiritual or whatever word you want to attach to it. These are sacred medicines or tools for the journey. <br /><br />Some good sites: http://www.maps.org/<br />http://csp.org<br /><br />I would suggest finding an experienced sitter to help facilitate a large dose journey with psilocybin or LSD.

				While I haven&#039;t had many spiritual trips (in the godly sense), psychedelics always have a way of opening my eyes to some information I&#039;d been unable to see in the world. Mushrooms get me very deep into thought about myself, my actions, and my place here on Earth. With the right intentions and mindset I&#039;ve found that you can learn some incredible things. I remember one of my earlier trips quite clearly to this day. I was feeling pretty down before the trip and wasn&#039;t sure where the trip was going to take me. After 4 grams of mushrooms and a couple hours of waiting the trip was taking me deep ride. Chasing my own thoughts into oblivion I had the realization that &quot;I&quot; am nothing, just some blob of consciousness floating around within this body. I felt I reached a place in my mind where it was completely empty, I was alone, and my purpose was completely lost. But this feeling of emptiness wouldn&#039;t hold for long. It was at this point in the trip that I had this incredibly real view of myself with a huge smile and incredible amount of joy, as I was literally sprouting from within my body and surging out through my throat. That emptiness inside of me was so quickly replaced with a overwhelming joy and understanding that I couldn&#039;t believe I didn&#039;t &quot;get it&quot; before. I might be a blob of consciousness floating around within this body, but that blob is ME. It is my heart and soul, and my will to be free. I learned that regardless of where my thoughts take me, I am always there with myself and I found that very comforting. <br /><br />Anyways, DMT provided by far the most &quot;spiritual&quot; experiences I&#039;ve had. If only I could make sense of it all! The most eye-opening trip I&#039;ve had with DMT I literally had my entire SELF ripped from me. I was dropped into hyperspace with a friendly &quot;light-being&quot; as I watched us both be stripped of our entire lives and left with only our true selves, or our souls as I&#039;ve come to speak of it. I was at peace here, knowing only what was absolutely current. Upon being dropped back into reality I was still in this soul-state, with absolutely no DATA to accompany it. I would wonder not only &quot;what is my name?&quot; but I had no recollection of any of my past. This subsided within a few minutes as my brain started googling itself and piecing together the data, as I remembered my experiences. On the DMT trip I was stripped of everything except for what I am. It was the most freeing experience of my life.<br /><br />I left out my experiences with LSD as it doesn&#039;t give me as strong of realizations or change in worldviews. My personal experience with LSD is a feeling of vast connectedness, happiness, and thoughts of how perfect and beautiful everything is. Wonderful tool in its own sense, but mushrooms and DMT (still need to grab some peyote one of these days) take me deep into my consciousness. Mushrooms take me an hour or 2 after the trip to really process all I went through mentally in that time-compressed manner. DMT leaves me in a state of &quot;holy shit I actually just experienced this?&quot;<br /><br />Hope I was able to answer your question to some extent. Just remember, have the right intentions (for me it&#039;s one of personal exploration and education) and stay strong for whatever comes your way along the trip. Don&#039;t fret, as even the darkest of trips have led me to the most amazing places in the end.

My lsd experience pretty much matched what you described. I bought some DMT on here and it was not that amazing. However, I lacked a meth pipe and used aluminum foil. I should try it again sometime. Any idea how I can make my own?

				Just look up on Erowid or Dmt-nexus? (I think that&#039;s it.) and they&#039;ll have good teks for DMT&nbsp; a straight to base (STB) seems best but there are other ways pretty easy synthesis if you are smart about it and careful with the chemicals and add them how you should as to not cause splashing or anything you wouldn&#039;t want especially chemical burns ;)

				Just recently took an 1/8th of some really dank shrooms but made the mistake of taking them in lemon shots (previous shrooms I have done never seemed that potent so figured I would need the help to get where I was going). For those of you not aware, lemon shots basically potentiate the active chemicals in shrooms and can turn even a half 1/8th into a very epic trip. Doing them this way also causes the effects to kick in within 30 minutes with peak not far behind.<br /><br />So there I am sitting on my couch with this feeling in my stomach. Not a sick feeling at all. That feeling of pure anticipation and excitement you would get from being at the top of a roller coaster about to go down the first hill. The body buzz was a struggle to cope with so I closed my eyes for a moment because watching South Park was just way too much at that moment. And out of nowhere an idea formed in my head. It seemed totally random to me but epic at the same time. The idea was that LOVE isn&#039;t just an emotion. It&#039;s a fixed point in time and space involving a person, place, or thing that all other points in our life can be referenced from and this is why you can love the memory of someone no longer in your life while not particularly caring for the person presently. Then I opened my eyes again and enjoyed the rest of my trip that seemed a lot more comfortable after the revelation.<br /><br />

				Shroom Ayahuasca is way more powerful than shrooms alone. I heard that Shroom Ayahuasca&nbsp; was the first ritually performed Ayahuasca by man, about 13&#039;000 years ago.<br />There are some Anthroplogists who think the first psychedelic ritual was even earlier, more&nbsp; than 40&#039;000 years ago, when some early humans ritually consumed the brains of bears. And we all know which substance can be found in the pineal gland...<br />Of course this theory can&#039;t be proven. But it&#039;s an interesting coincidence that the species Homo Sapiens appeared around 40&#039;000 BC.

				Yes, and different Ayahuasca blend is concocted according to different Curanderos. The real ritual, one would have to consult his Cura, for the exact concoction.<br /><br />For this reason, different tribes would have their own blends of Ayahuasca. And they are powerful.
