				I&#039;ll start: Friedrich Nietzsche. He breaks down principles and morality down to almost nothingness, proves them all paradoxical, and somehow makes sense out of them. He&#039;s simply magnificent and a great read for any psychonauts.

				Nietzsche is my favorite to read. Also he&#039;s one of the few who concerns himself primarily with the immediate reality of man being confronted with existence and how to deal with that. I find it the most practical of all those German guys. Certainly Nietzsche does the best job of ascertaining the difference between strength and weakness and applying it to explain history and human behaviors. <br /><br />I also like Ayn Rand, and though she may be incompatible with Nietzsche I find her appealing for different reasons. Her philosophical premise is interesting though fallible, but I think it achieves the correct conclusions for a political society. <br /><br />I like Francis Bacon&#039;s discussion of the empirical method in science.

The idea of God is that it is an entity that controls everything in the universe. What if the universe itself is God? All of our choices affect the universe on a microscopic scale in comparison. But if we&#039;re a collective consciousness, then everything in the world is God. And the stellar forces that are thought to &quot;control everything&quot;; maybe that&#039;s just the collective consciousness of ones/spirits/individuals who once, or never, &quot;lived&quot; but affect the universe in their own way; our dimensions are may be either converged or separate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18504.msg185573#msg185573">Quote from: 34tuforlunch on April 11, 2012, 06:26 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Jesus!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There&#039;s a troll in the basement!

				I think anybody who feels a bit adrift in this world, should take some classes in western philosophy and go from there.&nbsp; From Aristotle and Plato, if you have a good teacher it can be really exciting.&nbsp; I mean, sure, it&#039;s useless in one sense, but I felt like finally thoughts that were kind of unformed and incoherent in me, had been voiced and thought about before I was even around.<br /><br />I noticed David Hume hadn&#039;t been mentioned, but he seemed to pull the rug out from beneath rationalism and empiricism both, simply by showing that we don&#039;t really know if nature is uniform, so where do our laws come from, and all we really know is from experience.&nbsp; And it&#039;s all perception anyway.&nbsp; Kant is another one that woke me up, especially the categories just being human constructs...<br /><br />Nietzsche is brilliant, and probably the antecedent to the previously mentioned existentialists anyway...he&#039;s said just about everything that can be said, and better than the guys who followed him anyway.&nbsp; Convicts invariably love him, and think he is talking about them, as the supermen, but again, every convict who ever read a book thinks he&#039;s above morality blah blah blah...<br /><br />Another dark one is Schopenhauer, mostly seems similar to Kant, to me, but it&#039;s his aphorisms and essays that are appealing.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s easy to get all superior and phony with philosophy, but fuck all that: they can give you a whole lot of comfort in an otherwise cold and unfeeling universe.&nbsp; Heroin, jails, it&#039;s nice to find that maybe it&#039;s not you, but the world around you that&#039;s fucked...most of the great thinkers seemed to think that ethics was where they really wanted to be, but had to explain what was what, first, and then come up with reasons why we should act good anyway...<br /><br />I was in a war, and a friend sent me kafka and camus...but I needed to get a bit of western philosophy under my belt before I could understand what camus was saying, tho with freedom--and despair--at least I could crawl out of the hole and make my choices, and live with the consequences...seems like all of camus is just saying why carry on at all, if it&#039;s all for nothing?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />And certainly makes heroin defensible....

Thats if you use it in present sociocultural context! Philosophy is philosophy and shouldn&#039;t be so much taken in context of a society, but humans overall. Forget morals, forget ethics, forget what you&#039;ve learned from religion and government; what&#039;s left? Just a human being with intuition and instinct; what would they do is what really matters. Most western philology only works with present day humans and not each throughout history and that&#039;s what halts my belief in it; although it&#039;s still a good read.<br /><br />As far as Nietzsche goes; his Ubermensch theory is right on. We&#039;re just stopped by our current morality system, as he says. Convicts love him because they were put into prison for not following the ethics of the current system; it&#039;s only fitting for them.<br /><br />What does Schopenhauer speak on?<br />

				Dostoevsky and Camus for (relatively) accessible existentialist novels. <br /><br />Allen Wheelis- &quot;The Way We Are&quot;, a quick read about the human condition. He&#039;s a psychoanalyst, which I&#039;m not really into, but parts of this book really resonated with me, especially after going on a long Nietzsche binge. <br /><br />Speaking of Nietzsche...there have already been good suggestions for him, but I also recommend his essay &quot;On Truth and Lying in a Non-Moral Sense,&quot; especially if you liked On the Genealogy of Morality. <br /><br />For Buddhism, I suggest Dogen&#039;s &quot;Moon in a Dewdrop&quot; or anything by Nagarjuna. The Diamond Sutra. The parable of the poison arrows. Any koans. I also liked Brad Warner&#039;s punk rock interpretations of Buddhism, like his book titled &quot;Sit Down and Shut Up!&quot; Good stuff. <br /><br />I like lots and lots of other stuff, but I may have to vote Epicurus as my all-time favorite. He was just a baller. <br /><br />&quot;Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?<br />Then he is not omnipotent.<br />Is he able, but not willing?<br />Then he is malevolent.<br />Is he both able and willing?<br />Then whence cometh evil?<br />Is he neither able nor willing?<br />Then why call him God?&quot;<br /><br />and&nbsp; &quot;Stranger, here you will do well to tarry; here our highest good is pleasure.&quot; <br /><br />Paradoxes and placing pleasure (though not necessarily hedonism) above all else? Yes, please.
