				Wow.... what a day i had this last weekend. I want to share a story, because i can&#039;t tell anyone else.<br /><br />last weekend me and my Son went to a farm yard quite far from where we live, Last fall i had been there and noticed in the corner of the &quot;Barn&quot; there were tall stacks of 1 foot thick styrofoam sheets, approx 4&#039; x 4&#039;.... as i had just bought my young son a small compound bow, we needed a &quot;Backstop&quot; for his arrows.<br /><br />So i go into the building (it has no door!) and go to the back where the styrofoam is, and i grab one of them off a small stack, just then i notice a large zip lock baggie fall down to the ground, it must have been between the sheets of foam....<br /><br />well, initially i notice a wad of 20 dollar bills, (50 to be exact), then there is an envelope in there as well.... and in the envelope is 50- 100 dollar bills! SCORE!!!!<br /><br />i snatched er up and put it in my jacket! my kid was playing in the corner and never seen anything. what a morning, made six grand, and got a backstop. I have no idea who&#039;s it (was), or why it was there, all i know is its mine now!<br /><br />i wish these kind of things happened more often!

				Someone was looking down on you!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />If i were you ... If he hasnt got one already ,,, then i&#039;d open a bank account for your son - and put at least a grand in there for later in his life. After all ... if it wasnt for him, then you&#039;d probably never have found it&nbsp; ;D

				Yeah, well he&#039;s got an account! and every few months i make him deposit all the change i give him! the little guy has quite a lucrative gig going one with that alone! He has to clean out my truck once a week, and i clean out my office desk drawer and let him keep all that. i go him one of those &quot;electronic&quot; piggy banks, every 3 months or so he cleans it out and we count/roll up all the change, he avarages about 275-300 bucks a crack.<br /><br />he&#039;s a good little guy, the best Son a man could ever be blessed with..... :-) Anyways, besides my initial party purchase, the rest will go to good causes. hell, ive found a twenty before, but never a wad like this. i guess you could say its a one in a lifetime type thing! tax free!<br /><br />take care y&#039;all!<br /><br />Ginnz!<br /><br />&nbsp;
