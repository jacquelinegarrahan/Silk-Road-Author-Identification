				I am totally addicted. And I&#039;m not even talking about drugs, I&#039;m talking about SR. It&#039;s even getting scary how much I keep browsing the site and the forum. Probably because this is all so new and exciting. Without a doubt one of the milestone in the history of the internets. <br /><br />So yeah, I love it for most of the reasons mentioned in this thread, except for the guns which is lame to have here and does damage to the image of the reasonable proponents of responsible drug use that we are, at least many of us. <br /><br />Let&#039;s enjoy SR to the max, while it lasts.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				Because now when&nbsp; I reference a .onion people have to wonder whether I am into drugs or CP. (Only drugs thank you)<br />Ha but really.. because this place is a really is great. We have a great community - some really friendly, intelligent, and witty people. Most days I love everything about my time here from vending to modding. Also its a great reminder that their are those who take pride in their vending/work, which is so refreshing, not just dealing with uninformed overpriced shit. <br />Love you all : )<br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				How do I love thee?&nbsp; Let me count the ways:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Silk Road mitigates the inherent violence of government prohibition.&nbsp; Yes, I still have to worry about violence from the gang of people with badges and guns (cops) in some regard but the threat of getting robbed by a dealer is nearly non-existent.&nbsp; The threat of being caught &quot;red-handed&quot; in the act of a drug deal is nearly non-existent.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; The community is wonderful.&nbsp; We will never eliminate irresponsible drug users and crooked dealers, but through communication and sharing of knowledge through trip reports/experiences, safety &amp; best practices, and vendor feedback we raise the overall responsibility level.&nbsp; Very few people want to get brain damage or kill themselves through drug abuse.&nbsp; Because of drug prohibition, we don&#039;t have (many) professional doctors, chemists, psychologists and scientific testing to study the benefits and detriments of many of these substances.&nbsp; However, by cooperating, communicating, and supporting the community we can negate this harmful side-effect of prohibition.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Buying drugs on a website and having them delivered in the mail is fucking cool&nbsp; :D :D :D
