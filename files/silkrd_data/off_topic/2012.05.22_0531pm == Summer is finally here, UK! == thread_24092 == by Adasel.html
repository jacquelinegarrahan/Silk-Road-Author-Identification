				Yeah no fucking duh it&#039;s summer. I had a littler more than a gram and a half of DMT hidden in my closet, but after I came home from hiking in this ungodly 108 degree weather I discovered that my DMT melted. Fuck my life right? &gt;:(<br /><br />Well anyways, I just stuck the bag in the freezer hoping it&#039;ll recrystallize and I might have a chance to salvage some of it. :&#039;(

				Also more on topic.. OP have you forgotten that BEASTLY week we had in April? That was fucking amazing. My mate bought a pool for her back garden on the last day of the heatwave before the rain kicked in again HAHAHAHA.. Gotta love English optimism.<br /><br />There&#039;s something about the warmth of the sun. It just feels so fucking good when you feel the heat over your body.. it brings you to life. Also it brings out the summer scents of the world.. shit takes me back to childhood. <br /><br />I&#039;m really fucking hoping it&#039;s sunny all this summer. MDMA + booze + sunlight and there is no equal.

				No, your absolutely right.&nbsp; Its true that when the summer is out, people seem to en mass on the streets.<br />We have become a culture who do nothing but complain about the weather.&nbsp; Most years we are lucky if we get two solid weeks of summer.<br />Its not like california or arizona mate.<br />So obviously we want to appreciate the sun when it finally arrives.<br />Not sure how accurate the info is, but according to weather forcasts it looks like we are in for one, glorious long hot summer.<br />Oh, btw, not ALL of us are hermit weirdos! lol

				Ah sollemnis, at least you have a car dude.&nbsp; I have to ride everywhere an a fucking bike mate.&nbsp; When i leave work and that sun hits my back its a killer.&nbsp; It might only take 20 mins to get to and from work but in this heat it feels like an hour.<br />Someone on here said about the winter being the best or something.&nbsp; They are kinda right as in winter you can wrap up and feel all nice and cosy.&nbsp; In this heat you fucked, you cant escape it.<br />However as for your journey on the M1, you really have my sympathies dude.&nbsp; Time to break out the ice cubes.

				It was me who pointed that out... It&#039;s true, its easy to mask the cold with some extra layers. Ahh sorry you haven&#039;t got a car bro, neither have I. Passed my test when I was 19 but never bothered getting a car. Why? Simply because insurance is a joke... I&#039;d be paying more for insurance than the car itself! Oh well, least I don&#039;t have to fork out for petrol... I have more money for drugs&nbsp; ;D Win-win.

				Sollemnis you are totally right there mate.&nbsp; One of the reasons i dont drive is because of the costs.&nbsp; Not just the insurance, everyone knows its ridiculous. Its also the cost of lessons, petrol like you said and maintaining the car in general.&nbsp; It&#039;s just one big money drain.

				Yeah i hear you geedog.&nbsp; When we got that batch of sunny weather they also said we are going to have the hottest summer on record, probably august or september i cant remember which.<br />Who wants to bet we get the same shit as last year, two weeks of unbearable heat then pissing down with rain the rest of the year.&nbsp; Then to kick a man while he is down, a SERIOUSLY cold fucking winter.

				Haha I have worked all over mate. :) Amsterdam is fun though. <br /><br />And yeah the cafes are cool, and yeah you can do that in some places. I wasn&#039;t really into them because I don&#039;t smoke puff but I went to them a fair bit. Normally got on the brownies and shit though because they don&#039;t spin me out so much. The hookers are obviously pretty blatant but I never used them, I find that sort of thing a bit of a cringe.

				I don&#039;t know about everyone else, but there is something about the British summertime that I just love. I mean, a lot of places in the world have it good for sun and warm weather, but in the UK when we have a day like that EVERYONE makes use of it.<br /><br />Cant be enjoying ourselves too much though; need to spend some time thinking how best to squeeze as much fun out of Notting Hill as possible! <br />Last year for me was a lot of time spent at Channel 1 dub and Pineapple tribe. I know most people relate MDMA to repetitive dance music (and don&#039;t get me wrong, it goes hand in hand with it perfectly) I just love to drop at a dub sound system...<br />Think I may spend this year around Abi-tshanti area one day and Martix drum and bass for other. <br />Anyone else looking forward to it?

				On the topic that summer is finally here, I drove past Heathrow Airport today and those huge reservoirs (yes the ones that are &#039;empty&#039; and causing a drought) are overflowing. All three of the water butt&#039;s in my garden are full and my garden itself is under a few cm of water meaning the groundwater level is pretty high.

				Has there ever been a summer when a heatwave has not been promised? Those media clowns say that shit EVERY year because it shifts units, every fucking year! Last real hot dry summer I remember was in the 80s, I swear. A good summer is as rare as good cocaine in the UK. Its been shit in Europe last few years too.&nbsp; ::)

I doubt that<br /><br />But you&#039;re right, it is always passed off as a heatwave summer. My fault for buying into it I guess.
