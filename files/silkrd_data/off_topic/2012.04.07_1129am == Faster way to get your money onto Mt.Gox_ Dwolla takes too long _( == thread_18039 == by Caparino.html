				I see a new listing and I deposit asap but it takes at least 5 days to clear; by that time the listing is usually sold out. Mind you, I&#039;m only 20 years old and working a shitty ~35 hours a week job so I don&#039;t have the money to set aside beforehand so please don&#039;t offer that as an option.

				Buy BTC&nbsp; from vendors on the site. We usually deliver BTC within 4 hours.

				dude from SR to MTGOX takes me maybe 2 hours and from mtgox to dwolla it takes me like 5 minutes because I have a commercial account, is that what you mean by transferring and cashing out?

				I use a fairly complicated process, but it only takes about 5 hours. First, I use bitinstant. Basically, you make a deposit at Bank of America in cash, and then they&#039;ll instantly deposit that cash into Mt. Gox or CryptoXChange. (I use the later). From there, you can buy bitcoins. That step is pretty quick, and usually takes less than two hours. If you email the bitinstant people with your deposit number, they&#039;ll actually process the order within a few minutes. From there, I withdraw the money from CryptoXChange to a btc wallet, where I then transfer it in random chunks to 4 other btc addresses. I then transfer from those addresses to my SR account. Those last couple steps are probably a little unnecessary, but as it only adds a few hours, I figure it&#039;s no big deal, and it makes it a lot harder to track where the money is coming from and going.
