Something has to happen. So this fund was created to make something happen. We need 50 btc to send a letter bomb filled with ricin to benjamin phelps, son of the infamous fred phelps, the founder of Westboro, to make him feel the pain he inflicts on the loved ones of the heroes of america and the world; soldiers, gay rights activists, and now CHILDREN. They both deserve whats coming to them, and even if this attempt fails, it will send a clear message, that the world will stand against hate.

I&#039;d hate to see some innocent postal worker get harmed. They all deserve a very painful, gruesome death. If they lived in any other country in the world they would have all been wiped out by now. I remember they planned a trip to picket somewhere in England. The Prime Minister barred any of them from entering the country, stating that it wasn&#039;t possible to ensure their safety because far too many Brits were dead set on murdering them the second they got off the plane. It&#039;s unfortunate Fred Phelps didn&#039;t go ahead with pulling the trigger on the shotgun when he had it in his mouth all those years ago, all strung out on Meth. We can all take solace in the fact that their inevitable deaths at the hands of angry Americans will make the world a far better place. Do you guys have any other plans besides a bomb in the mail? I&#039;d gladly damn near drain my bank account if I knew even one of those assholes would die as a result, but I&#039;d only be comfortable helping fund something that ensures only they suffer because of it.

				I understand y&#039;all&#039;s concern. The package would be made by a professional and we don&#039;t necessarily have to include the bomb part of it; only using the ricin would make him suffer all the more. If enough people are interested we could shell out the big bucks for a hit, but we&#039;re nowhere close to and have no connections in kansas. if someone does and wants to post here to create a fund of their own to make these scumbags suffer, lets do it. for now ill post a poll asking if people would prefer we take the cheap way with some risk of harming an innocent, or the expensive way where the fuckers just die.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94495.msg668920#msg668920">Quote from: BruceCampbell on December 19, 2012, 03:43 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think they&#039;re really fucked this time.

				Soldiers are not heroes. That said, these cunts actually WANT you to attack them. It&#039;s a very lucrative business for them, every adult in Fred Phelp&#039;s family is a licensed attorney, they provoke people to swing at them or otherwise violate their rights so they can sue them into oblivion. If they really are going to protest these kids&#039; funeral they are gonna end up hitting the jackpot.

I believe most reasons to become a soldier are poor, but if there is a cause you truly believe in, you should be respected for laying your very life on the line for it. The problem of abuse in the military is very real, but it is not nearly as rampant as you say it is, and regardless, anyone who has as firm convictions as a volunteer solider must should be respected.

				Sorry but that&#039;s bullshit; conviction alone does not make you worthy of respect. Take the fucksticks in the DEA for example. Most of them truly believe they are providing a service and doing the right thing, but in reality they are parasites that make a living by ruining the lives of the innocent for no good reason at all.

So I&#039;m going to pretend this is just some type of trolling, or something that those interested druggies among us will eventually forget about (it&#039;s what druggies do best).<br /><br />But, since we&#039;re on the subject, people should definitely check out Louis Theroux&#039;s excellent documentary on Westboro from a few years back. The thing that sticks with me the most are his interactions with the kids who had the misfortune of being born into that life. How they have this weird smile on their face whenever they recite the bullshit hate they&#039;re programmed with, like on some basic level they know what they&#039;re saying is wrong in some way, but the adults around them have fucked with their innate sense of right and wrong to the point that they can&#039;t really tell the difference between the two. Probably saddest of all is when Louis asks them if people at school know about Westboro, and if they&#039;re treated any particular way. It&#039;s pretty heart breaking to see 8 and 10 year olds come to tears saying how they feel everyone hates them and no one wants to be their friend. But if you&#039;ve ever wondered how hate and ignorance maintain themselves through generations, this is a VERY instructive documentary. Fittingly enough it&#039;s called &quot;The Most Hated Family in America.&quot; Great doc, definitely worth a watch.

				This group is doing their job well, as evidenced by this thread.<br /><br />EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. Pay attention to what you&#039;re saying/thinking about this group because so far every single person in this thread has fucked up.<br /><br />This group exists to spread hate. They want nothing more than to turn people against each other, and create hatred and negative thought. If you&#039;re sitting here thinking, &quot;those fuckers deserve to die,&quot; then they&#039;re winning. If you think their hatemongering is funny and you promote it, then they&#039;re winning. They need attention to be successful, and so far they&#039;re doing that extremely well. If you really want them to disappear, then don&#039;t discuss them, don&#039;t spend any of your time or money or brainpower on them. Disregard them, treat them with the amount of respect that an attention whore deserves.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t even read this thread without getting angry about the group and their actions, but also everyone&#039;s reactions here. We&#039;re supposed to be a more rational community than average, why can&#039;t we act like it when people ruffle our feathers?<br /><br />Just my thoughts on WBC.<br /><br />EDIT: I understand that it may be hard to ignore these soulless creatures if they&#039;re picketing and yelling at your child&#039;s funeral. I would probably be the first to attack them if it was my child. But they feed off of the reaction of those that they offend. Everywhere they go, they probably get looks of disgust and shock and even people lashing out at them. But what would they do if nobody looked their way? If people were able to contain their emotions and ignore the group, then I truly believe that they would recede. I doubt they would dissolve altogether, but if their mission is to ruin people&#039;s day and everyone just continues about their business as normal then it&#039;s probably going to fuck with THEIR heads.

This was in fact the doc referred to, but not the only whistleblower. It is quite rampant, absolutely, positively, 100%. In every sector of the defence force in U.S. except for National Guard, where I haven&#039;t heard anything happen but probably does, also in Australian Army and Navy, Duntroon and ADFA.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry if any of my above post causes offense, your brother being one, but I absolutely stand by it as it has been backed up over the years, not just from the SBS doco. (I will edit this part of my post in 60 minutes, but [edit] transferred [edit] transferring to [edit] when he quit, and as far as I know he didn&#039;t rape anyone in [edit], however to be fair, he was not FT and that is where the abuse occurs and if he DID rape somebody and I knew of it I would penetrate him with a kitchen knife, castrate him and finally choke him to death with my goddamn phucing hands.) <br /><br />As for &quot;you should be respected for laying your very life on the line for it..........anyone who has as firm convictions as a volunteer solider must should be respected.&quot; , well I guess that depends on whether you have put others through abuse and unjustified torture doesn&#039;t it? ALL servicemen are prepared to lay down their lives for their country, but ironically some of the world&#039;s very worst, depraved scumbags come from the defense forces and have inflicted unspeakable evil (can I say that? Phuc it, I will!) on those in a vulnerable position. What about that dickhead U.S. serviceman (not having a go at U.S., just saying what defense force he was in) shot a bunch of Iraqis in a drunken rage (fucking idiot), or the sniper who took a bet whether he could bag a civilian while on &quot;duty&quot;, and actually killed them (fucking idiot), or perhaps further afield the U.N. Peacekeepers who reportedly carried out widespread rape on the very people they were supposed to protect (fucking idiots), and citing a more specific example one of them who raped a girl and then murdered her whole family, herself included, in order to avoid it being found out (fucking idiot, it was still found out)? <br /><br />Do you ever wonder why I keep harping on about this subject, if subtly, every so often? Do you have any fucking idea what it is like to hold on to all this information on sexual abuse and to not forget any of it? I won&#039;t even touch on the more serious rapes involving extensive and severe torture (even by torture standards) and genital mutilation that I am unfortunate enough to have knowledge of as this forum should really not be for that kind of thing. I&#039;m trying to keep this clean, however there&#039;s no way in phuc I can stand by while somebody makes the comment &quot;but it is not nearly as rampant as you say it is, and regardless, anyone who has as firm convictions as a volunteer solider must should be respected.&quot; even if you mean well, which I am sure you do. Sexual abuse is something that I am not unfamiliar (not saying I was, not saying I wasn&#039;t, not saying anything so shut the phuc up) with and has always pervaded my right and wrong indicators. I have built myself, or rather my body has, into a frenzy of ever-increasing loathing and hatred for anybody who has done this to someone. One of my few regrets is that I have still not yet found somebody who falls into this category and who is within my area of effect. (People change houses.)<br /><br />You&#039;re dead wrong about this issue. When somebody is in the military it&#039;s anticipated that their family will support them. It&#039;s loyalty. It&#039;s expected. I&#039;m not surprised to hear you say it&#039;s not rampant. But totally dead wrong. I wouldn&#039;t waste your time by telling you something that I had a passing opinion on.<br /><br />Piece out.
