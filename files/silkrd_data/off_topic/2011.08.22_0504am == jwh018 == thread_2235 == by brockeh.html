				No it wouldnt, my armchair biochem at work again but i beleieve pretty much all cannabinoids are too large of a molecule to pass the blood brain barrier, not sure if its water soluble either so in short i dont think there are any insuffluable cannabinoids, certainly none i know of and im sure one of the crazy medical dispensaries would have come up with a nasal pump spray, theyve turned it into everything else, its medicine there of course, i mean rasta billys purple grape flavoured cannabis sweets are the perfect way to give meds to grown adults, can we get it in sherbert form with a licorice stick next and where is my bannana flavoured ibuprofen tincture, ibuprofen is a med too so why isnt it marketed in the same way. Can you tell im not keen on this whole medical dispensary thing, its absurd

				thanks for your reply, confirmed with seller its nonactive to snort :(<br /><br />as for medical mj, while im sure there are a lot of people in pain who need their medicine, i get the idea from what ive seen/heard about it (dont live in cali, or even the us) that its mainly just stoners using it, so grape lollies would make sense in that regard. they may be pushing it too far too fast and strangle the golden goose so i guess i agree with you

				youre best bet is to vape it, or just sprinkle it in a tobacco spliff if you fancy itll still rip your face off, be careful though a little can go a long with with 018, many people dissolve it in an alcohol that evaporates cleanly and add it to some tobacco or smoking mixture, add it to rolling tobacco and youve got stealth smoking anywhere, be aware though itll build your tolerance fast, its also known for causing panic attacks in some especially at higher doses, so if you are going the sprinkle method remember to sprinkle lightly<br /><br />i believe its soluble as most canabinoids are in fats and alcohol, so if it were possible then an alcohol based thc/synth nasal spray would have been done by now, as i said im pretty sure i read somewhere canabinoids are too large a molecule so cant pass through the blood brain barrier so insufflutaion (spelling?) is pretty much out of the question
