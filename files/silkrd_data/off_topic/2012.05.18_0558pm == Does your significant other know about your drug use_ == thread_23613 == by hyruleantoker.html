				Hey everyone! My girlfriend does not know that I use drugs. She knows that I smoke weed on occasion, and I told her once that I tried ecstasy.<br />She was quite upset when I told her that, and I told her I probably wouldn&#039;t do drugs again, but I told her I can&#039;t make that a promise.<br />She told me not to tell her if I do drugs, because if I do, she probably wouldn&#039;t talk to me for a week or more. I occasionally think I should stay away from drugs entirely for her sake, but I haven&#039;t experienced all that I want to yet.<br /><br />I&#039;m curious about other people&#039;s relationships, and how drugs tie into them. Please vote and maybe even explain a little bit in a post.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />HT

				The girls i have been together with have always been like me enjoyed rolling and smoking and stuff like that. I actually don&#039;t think i want to be with a girl who don&#039;t do drug actually cause that would only be a source of conflict. That being said i have been in a relationship with a junkie once and i am not doing that again. Didn&#039;t know she was a junkie when we became an item tho

				Not currently in a relationship, but all of my previous significants have known what I like to feed my head with, particularly cannabis and acid (formerly hallucinogens in general but now I have my favorite).<br /><br />I&#039;ve known several people who stopped taking drugs for their other. I respect that a lot for casual users who recognize that their other is more significant than the drugs.<br /><br />Personally, I have varied reasons for smoking including that it keeps me from getting stressed and depressed and flipping out on people for reasons which only exist in my mind. For these reasons, I will not give up smoking for my other. If they can&#039;t accept that, they shouldn&#039;t be my other. I can&#039;t have two important aspects of my life clashing, or hiding from each other for that matter.<br /><br />My relationship with acid is more of a pure choice, as I wouldn&#039;t suffer great negative effects from not taking it, but part of my worldview includes what I experience on acid, which means that if I stopped I would be closing off half of my world. I can&#039;t be with someone who would ask that of me. Some people don&#039;t understand, they say &quot;it&#039;s just a drug.&quot; Many of my most profound shared experiences have been fueled by one psychedelic or another, particularly acid. That right there makes it more than a drug.<br /><br />And so all of my past others have been aware, and all of my future others will be at least as aware. Honestly, I don&#039;t plan on getting in further relationships with anyone I can not share psychedelic experiences with.

				Mine knows and participates with most of it (MDMA, amph, occasional coke/weed) - but doesn&#039;t know about my meth use (so I chose that option).&nbsp; He also knows about my other SR forum name, so this is a more targeted account for stealth purposes.&nbsp;

				before i met my girlfriend, i drank too much and was a snorter/stoner. now that we&#039;ve been together over a year, i&#039;ve given up alcohol for the most part... and got tired of snorting/smoking. she doesn&#039;t know the extent of my opiate use...but we&#039;ve just moved in together. so i doubt i&#039;ll be hiding it. we&#039;ll have to see how it goes. <br /><br />if she asked me to give it up (for the sole fact that it is slowly killing me)... i would. i think that&#039;s the difference between her and all those past women who weren&#039;t made exactly for me.<br /><br />/hopeless romanticism

				My partner is as much into it as I am. I have a daily weed habit, where as she will only smoke once or twice a week.<br /><br />Her big love is with mushrooms, mine more MDMA, APB etc... Both recreationaly and as exploratory tools. <br /><br />Mind you, we both don&#039;t exactly see the world as the rest of the planet do and I am glad to have found someone who also knows that their body is a sovereign nation and that just because somethings illegal, doesn&#039;t make it wrong.

				I think if your SO doesn&#039;t know or approve of your drug use you&#039;re going to eventually have problems. I am glad mine enjoys them as much as I do. :)

Yeah, I suppose it could be seen that way. I think it&#039;s more of her past, where she&#039;s lost close friends to drug abuse, and she has forever locked her mind into seeing drugs as bad. She doesn&#039;t care about weed, she won&#039;t do it, but she doesn&#039;t have any negative thoughts about it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to lose either her or drugs, so I may try talking about it with her, although those conversations are always some degree of uncomfortable. If I end up having to choose, I&#039;ll choose to keep her. I just feel like I need to experience what other drugs have to offer just once though.

				In my humble experience I would say you have a choice to make OP.&nbsp; She may be comfortable with it now, but when times are not so rosy it will be a big issue later on.<br /><br />I married someone who would occasionally smoke weed or do acid with me, but it was never a big part of her life.&nbsp; These days every bowl I smoke I get the evil eye, or a lecture.&nbsp; It is nonsensical to say the least.&nbsp; I barely drink anything, and I&#039;m not violent or unable to function.&nbsp; I love my kids and play with them, do things with them, etc.<br /><br />I can respect her choice to not do drugs, and to follow her new found religious ideals (when we met she was an atheist), but I cannot stand the double standard of attacking me for my choice of lifestyle.&nbsp; Every fight we have my drug use is the ace up her sleeve.&nbsp; &quot;Your argument is invalid, you are high as a fucking kite.&quot;

				Currently not involved, however, my past two relationships both of my partners have partook in doing the drugs with me. First one loved the weed and I&#039;m still a light weight when I do occasionally smoke. I was more---I&#039;ll just stop myself and answer the damn question. Man, I always do that. Tell my life story and shit.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />Personally though, first relationship I didn&#039;t hide much when I was a drinker and it was messy. Second time I hid it and it still ended up messy. But I hated going through the routine and doing everything I can to &quot;sober&quot; up before she had a chance to suspect anything, it&#039;s like there&#039;s no point of even doing it. Not much of a point though when you abuse, it&#039;s just the thought and the act of doing it you rely on.

				Luckily I have a girlfriend as well that doesn&#039;t mind me doing drugs, but she worries at times when I try something new but I always reassure her that I did my research and wouldn&#039;t do it if I don&#039;t think I can handle. She also does drugs with me on occasion haha, shrooms don&#039;t sit in her stomach so well so I&#039;ll try and convince her to do some acid with me.

				She knows, but has no idea the extent. I use responsibly, though, and I stay sober when I&#039;m around her.
