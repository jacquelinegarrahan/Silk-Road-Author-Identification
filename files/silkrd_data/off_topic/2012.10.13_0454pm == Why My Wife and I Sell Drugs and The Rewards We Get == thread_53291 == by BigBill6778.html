				OK some of you may not believe this but my wife &amp; I are constant community supporters we donate a lot of money to Food banks to help out the less fortunate.At Thnanksgiving we did a little trial run here and asked members to donate to a food bank &amp; we would ship them a free Gram of jamican Oil a lot of people came forth and did just that we would like to thank them and wish them the best in life &amp; hope they feel good just for helping their fellow man (woman)<br /><br />anyways as I said we do a lot of charity work &amp; we always donate 20% of our earnings here on SR to the food bank ( IF THE GOVERNMENT &amp; COPS ONLY KNEW) <br /><br />Anyways from time to time we like to help out SICK people and we would like to share this email we got today from a buyer I hope it will justify to people why my wife &amp; I do this we are not here to get rich but to try and make a difference in OUR COUNTRY,OUR CITY, our own little piece of Heaven <br /><br />Hope you enjoy the reading<br /><br />Hi bill, i want to inform you that i am one of your steady customers previously using the account sakios. Sakios was a friend of mine in greece and he organised my transactions as he had a mature account, this is now my personal account. I have now moved to Australia but business remains the same to the same address. If you wish for me to finalize early due to the account being new, no problem. The oils are used orally by my father who has an aggressive brain tumor, around the same time that our first transaction was finalized the doctors had given him 2 weeks to live. Its been a long time since then and MRI scans show that his tumor is slowly shrinking. Because ive never had the chance to talk to you personally id like to say THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! without you knowing it you have played a big role in my families life for giving us access to such a medicine. Also from what i see your the only vendor who has such a product and for such a reasonable price and also chemical free. I plan to do many transactions about one every 7-14 days as we have been doing. Again thank you very much!!!!!! excellent service, oh and thanks for the hash you&#039;d put in a few times me and sakios got blazed quite nicely :)

				Very nicely said BigBill6778, it&#039;s lovely to hear from a vendor with a heart. I donate regularly to local causes in my community and national charities I believe in, it makes me feel good that I&#039;m helping someone less fortunate than myself, and it constantly reminds me to be truly grateful for what I have. Thank-you for sharing this, your post has really made me smile, and I wish your customer and his farther all the best too, sounds like your oils are doing great things in the world. +1 to you and your wife for your wonderful generosity :)

				+ 1 to Big Bill. <br /><br />Ha! I sit here right now in front of my PC rolling some of his oil into my dubbies&nbsp; ! I think we&#039;ve come a long way in seeing that medical marijuana does have a compassionate place in society. Hopefully Australia recognizes this too. In the meantime, it&#039;s good to know that people like BigBill and his wife are courageous enough to offer their services. Now we just have to lobby for complete decriminalization of this harmless stuff;&nbsp; next stop, recreational usage for the masses.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				+1 from me as well. I was going to send you&nbsp; a scanned paper proving where I had donated but I just didn&#039;t. I don&#039;t have a motive for getting anything whenever I donate.<br /><br />Really heart warming thing to read that email you got. Nice job keep it up

				Good on you! It&#039;s upsetting to think that there are people out there willing to put you away for a long time regardless of the medical properties of cannabis and your charity work. Don&#039;t forget the reward of being able to market and sell &quot;a good time&quot;!!
