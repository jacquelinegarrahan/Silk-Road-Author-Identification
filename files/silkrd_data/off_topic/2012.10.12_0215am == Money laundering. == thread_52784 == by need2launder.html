				So I`m a vendor on SR, I am either turning 18 soon or recently turned 18. I don`t want to be to specific for security reasons. <br />adulthood = taxes, I am just wondering would laundering my money completely be xfering bitcoins to cash without their being any record of the exchange or would it be having it exchanged to cash then declaring the money and claim it as revenue from some unrecorded legal source like freelance coding online gambling or anything that is not really recorded. I am not expected paragraph answers or anything I know this is info usually paid for but links to deepweb sites that would help me do some investigating on the matter would be much appreciated, thanks!

				Money laundering is taking the proceeds of an illegal business and funneling it into a legitimate business to make it appear legal, taxable, and earned.<br /><br />Now, to answer your questions.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: need2launder</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I am just wondering would laundering my money completely be xfering bitcoins to cash without their being any record of the exchange</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, this is just cashing out your bitcoins and launders the money in exactly 0 ways.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: need2launder</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">having it exchanged to cash then declaring the money and claim it as revenue from some unrecorded legal source like freelance coding online gambling or anything that is not really recorded.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is, I&#039;m lead to believe, technically money laundering. There actually is some kind of tax-code in the US, or there was at some point in time, that would allow you to essentially do exactly this. The risk is that too many funds will get the government staring at your doings, to figure out where it comes from. But paying taxes makes Johnny Law slow-down, from what I&#039;ve heard?<br /><br />Fuck it, I&#039;m not a laundry expert. This is all conjecture based on what I&#039;ve read in various places(most of it the forums)

				Yes little dude. You make it look legit and make it bomb-proof so when you get audited you can show the receipts and the orders and the payments that led to the cash coming into your account.<br /><br />That&#039;s laundered.<br /><br />Otherwise just make it spread out and obfuscated to not attract attention.<br /><br />If you are making a lot of money, pay Limitless to learn a more professional approach.<br /><br />Modzi
