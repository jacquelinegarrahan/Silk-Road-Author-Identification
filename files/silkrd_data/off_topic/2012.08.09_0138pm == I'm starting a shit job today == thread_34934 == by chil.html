				Not because I want to, because I need to. I&#039;m out of money and one of the only available employment right now is telephone surveyor, the annoying guy that calls you when you&#039;re relaxing at home to ask you whether you want to answer a survey or an opinion poll, and it usually lasts more than the promised 5 minutes, something more like 40 minutes. The guy that get repeatedly shut down or yelled at, for a minimum income. <br /><br />Jesus, I&#039;m in my thirties and I have to do this, just when I thought I had my share of shit jobs. <br /><br />Feel free to share your shit job experiences, I need it.

				You could just call in a bomb threat, that&#039;s a free day off whenever you want. I always email a bomb threat to companies that give me bad service, makes me feel better about life.

				Maybe a healthy mixture of all 3? :P<br /><br />You have to make it relevant to your locality though. For instance if you are in Northern Ireland.....maybe say it&#039;s from Pat Sweeney of one of the offshoot groups of the IRA? If you are in the mainland U.K then it&#039;s obviously Al Qaeda or the IRA. If you are in the U.S then you have a bit more room because you could say you are one of those cooky White Supremacist Militias, Cults or Al Qaeda. If you want to drift a little further afield and you are say Spanish then you can say ETA. Italy then say you are an organized crime group but then you&#039;d have to adjust the threat to fit the profile. <br /><br />Anyway I am sure you get the picture. :) Just get creative and get a nice day off work. :)

				Worked in a call center years ago. This was to help people fix PCs or laptops at home. The job was both boring and funny as some of the problems people had were hilarious. <br /><br />A LOT of workers used drugs. Boredom was a factor. We would hang outside and smoke a joint each for lunch break.<br /><br />Done worse jobs than call centers but never cold called.<br /><br />Just remember not to take it personal when people slam phones down and tell you to fuck off.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)

				I worked for one of those. Was fun because no matter what answer they&#039;d give, I selected what I liked. For example &quot;which song would most appeal to you in an ad&quot; always went for what I liked. Make the best of it. Also its a job you can do completely wrecked

				I used to work at a coffee shop. I was hired because I was fresh and enthusiastic and happy all the time. I was perfect, and treated everyone with respect, professionalism, and general awesomeness. But we had so many customers all the time and there was a LOT of douchebags. Makes me wish I would&#039;ve invested $75 in a vial of DOC and dosed those motherfuckers. Instead they got decaf coffee and they were sleepy at work. Don&#039;t be a dick to a barista, or anyone for that matter.

				Whaha, this thread is genius!<br /><br />Would it be secure to use (instead of tormail) a gmail account, made using Tor?<br /><br />Because when the police see the @tormail.org address, they know immediately they&#039;re dealing with the Tor network. However if they see gmail, then they&#039;ll try to get the IP address, only to find it&#039;s an exit node. Which means the police lose more time on their investigation.<br /><br />Also it adds to credibility. <br /><br />People who know to how to use Tor are calculating, and technologically savvy.<br />People who makes a serious bomb threat (ie: with actual intent of doing it) are generally disorganized. They&#039;re on an angry rampage. (If you&#039;re smart and you really want to bomb people, you don&#039;t give any warnings)<br /><br />So then your story is more credible. Police will try to get the IP address of the sender, only to find it&#039;s from an exit node. You hide the fact that you&#039;re from Tor a little longer, which means your bomb threat will be scary for a longer time.<br /><br /><br />

				So long as you are secure use whichever email client you want. :) If you can use hotmail or gmail with Tor and it makes it even more plausible then yeah, awesome. :)
