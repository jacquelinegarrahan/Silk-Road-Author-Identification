				I have been using both, MtGox and Intersango, I have to say on MtGox I have to wait much longer for my money to be deposited and withdrawal, Both are quite big markets (mtgox the biggest at the moment). I would say for US users Mtgox would be better, and for European users Intersango. If you don&#039;t mind the commission on international wire transfer, intersango does not require you to give any details on larger withdrawal transactions, they don&#039;t ask. The fees in both are almost the same. So I would say it only depends on how fast you want to finalize any deal, and If you mind or don&#039;t mine bank wire transfer fees, or if you want other payments method dwolla etc than only MtGox. <br />Too bad thou that MtGox is so big, it can steer the market, If there would be more exchanges like MtGox the price would remain more stable.<br /><br />In other words both of them are trustworthy.

				The owners of MtGox are openly working with the DEA to prevent the &quot;misuse&quot; of Bitcoins, so just know that if you buy from them they keep detailed records.&nbsp; And your account may be flagged for &quot;verification&quot;, as they call it, where you have to provide photocopies of state-issued ID.&nbsp; If this happens it won&#039;t matter if you already have bought Bitcoins through MtGox, you won&#039;t be able to transfer them out of your account until you provide all the ID they want.&nbsp; <br /><br />I&#039;ve heard it said that Intersango is opposed to SR, so they may just try the same kind of thing.&nbsp;
