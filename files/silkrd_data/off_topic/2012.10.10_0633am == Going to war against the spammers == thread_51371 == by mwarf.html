				Like the majority here I feel that this issue with the constant spam filling these boards is getting very old, if they were offering a legitimate service it may be different, but not only are they spamming the boards, but doing it with scams. In the past mods would take their time to clean up the posts by deleting all this spam, but that takes effort and there are generally more posts are up within the next 30 minutes. Captchas would slow the problem, but it would just force the spammers to work a little harder to put their scams out there. I suggest bringing it back to their door, crashing their websites for example. Ill be honest, Im not very savvy when it comes to computers, but I know there are others lurking here that are. Id be willing to throw some BTC at individuals or groups that want to spend some of their time fucking with these people. Im way far gone tonight, so this sounds like a good idea right now and spending some time reading the forums is a good way to come down imo. However, when there is 16 pages of unread posts to go through since I logged in a few hours ago and 14 of those pages are spam something needs to be done.&nbsp; &gt;:(

				Bump for you, just cause I was pissed off about this enough to want to start my own thread also. This is so obnoxious. And I don&#039;t think spamming the board is going to get them *any* business. Shitheads.

				but really, has anyone messaged DPS and Indica|Sativa asking for this to be implemented other than me? If not, what&#039;s stopping you. this spam is hard to sift through, and anything that can slow it down (or stop it) should be implemented quickly. the forums we read are full of spam, so maybe it&#039;s time the admin&#039;s PM boxes were filled to the brim with requests to stop it!
