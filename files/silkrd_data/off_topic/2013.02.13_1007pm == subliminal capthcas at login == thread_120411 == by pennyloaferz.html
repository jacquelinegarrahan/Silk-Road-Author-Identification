				So maybe its just me thinking too much (happens a lot), but do you guys ever get captchas on here that relate to what you are about to buy, or what you want to buy.&nbsp; I know my biggest roll order the captcha was &quot;rolls###&quot; or something like that , the last time i bought weed &quot;purp####&quot;, and just now Im not buying anything just finalizing but it was something else related to bud.

				yes man, I have noticed from the beginning that the SR captchas can have quite an uncanniness about them.<br /><br />fragments of drug enforcement related terms and echos of psychotic ramblings show up a seemingly overrepresentative amount <br /><br />&nbsp;:o (tinfoil hat smiley)&nbsp; 8)

Maybe the script just grabs a random word from a random entry in the database (or maybe even the forum database) to create a captcha with it.
