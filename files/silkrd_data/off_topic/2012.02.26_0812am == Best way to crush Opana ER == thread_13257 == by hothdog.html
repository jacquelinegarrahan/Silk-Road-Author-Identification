				Wondering what&#039;s the best way to remove the gnarly skin coating the Opana er&#039;s. I have been using a safety pin to peel it off, though I&#039;ve heard duct tape works well too. Anyone have a fast fuckin way to get this shit off?!?!<br />Thanks!

				Some will say hose clamp.&nbsp; Others will say emery board or file of some sort.<br />I myself just say screw it and grind it up coating and all, it never did seem to make a difference to me.

				wipe it off with a tiny bit of alcohol I heard. never tried that method. With the old OCs some just actually used spit to get the coating gooey and just wiped it off. im addicted to the process of even preparing the pill, so I take my sweet time and enjoy peeling the coatings off. Would try to peel the entire ring around the outside off in one piece from the old OCs for fun... i do this by using spit to just barely make the coating tacky, then it peels off easier after drying for a few seconds. dont know if that would work with the opana. I have only seen oxymorphone IRs recently.<br /><br />best way to crush something is with pressure :P

				i never took the time to lick coatings or remove them whenever i did a roxi (idk anyone i know who has) and the one time i did an opana it was soft and easy to crush, no removal of coating took place. It looked just like the one hatter has.<br /><br />i personally find that if i put a small piece of tinfoil above the bill then crush with credit card, i lose none of the powder as it easily comes off the tinfoil

				A hose clamp is all I ever use. I have never taken off the coating (except for old school oc&#039;s, which i just got wet in my mouth then wiped on my pants or shirt or whatever)... But a hose clamp will give you the best powder for snorting. You could also use it to shave off the coating, then shave a separate little pile for snorting...&nbsp; Once i discovered how well a hose clamp works i never crushed with dollars, lighters, or spoons ever again! A pill head&#039;s best friend!!
