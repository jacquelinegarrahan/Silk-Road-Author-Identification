				This post has been circulating the net and I thought it was rather funny, curious as to how true some of them are but funny nonetheless. My favorites are the wonderful names and the prisoners go on strike.<br /><br />http://www.shinbow.com/2012/06/18/proudly-south-african/<br /><br />YOU ARE PROUDLY SOUTH AFRICAN WHEN:<br /><br />You call a bathing suit a “swimming costume”<br /><br />You call a traffic light a “robot”<br /><br />The employees dance in front of the building to show how unhappy they are<br /><br />The SABC advertises and shows highlights of the program you just finished<br />watching<br /><br />You get cold easily. Anything below 16 degrees Celsius is Arctic weather.<br /><br />You know what Rooibos Tea is, even if you’ve never had any.<br /><br />You can sing your national anthem in four languages, and you have no idea<br />what it means in any of them.<br /><br />You know someone who knows someone who has met Nelson Madela<br /><br />You produce a R100 note instead of your driver’s licence when stopped by a<br />traffic officer.<br /><br />You can do your monthly shopping on the pavement.<br /><br />You have to hire a security guard whenever you park your car.<br /><br />Hijacking cars is a profession.<br /><br />The petrol in your tank may be worth more than your car.<br /><br />More people vote in a local reality TV show than in a local election.<br /><br />People have the most wonderful names: Christmas, Goodwill, Pretty,<br />Wednesday, Blessing, Brilliant, Gift, Precious, Innocence and Given.<br /><br />You continue to wait after a traffic light has turned to green to make way<br />for taxis travelling in the opposite direction.<br /><br />Travelling at 120 km/h you’re the slowest vehicle on the highway.<br /><br />You’re genuinely and pleasantly surprised whenever you find your car parked<br />where you left it<br /><br />A bullet train is being introduced, but we can’t fix potholes.<br /><br />The last time you visited the coast you paid more in speeding fines and toll<br />fees than you did for the entire holiday.<br /><br />You have to take your own linen with you if you are admitted to a government<br />hospital.<br /><br />You have to prove that you don’t need a loan to get one.<br /><br />Prisoners go on strike.<br /><br />You don’t stop at a red traffic light, in case somebody hijacks your car.<br /><br />You consider it a good month if you only get mugged once.

				I go to south africa a lot, some of this is true, normal highway speed is around 180km/h basicly however fast your car can go. If you go any slower blacks will through shit at your car and try kill/rob you not kidding, I remember a while back they took down a light pole put it across the road, some guy drove over it and his car got mangled, they pulled him out of his car put a tire around and lit him on fire. Weed their is like $10 an ounce though and wine is really cheap also.
