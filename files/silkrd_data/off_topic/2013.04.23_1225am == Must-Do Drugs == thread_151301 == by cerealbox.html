				I just got back from the doctor and got some very bad news. He said I had a rare condition called EBS (Explodey Brain Syndrome). My brain will catastrophically and suddenly explode in exactly 10 days. At this stage, there is no cure. It is inoperable. Since my doctor insists in being paid in Bitcoins, I only have enough left to purchase three drugs. As someone who has never had anything more than marijuana and alcohol, I want to know which three drugs I should choose. My doctor assured me that recreational drug use wouldn&#039;t affect either the high of the drugs nor the disease. Explodey Brain Syndrome is funny like that.

				thats crazy some half assed drugs or psychadelics what kind of trips would you be having knowing you;re gonna die in 10 days ? heroin/cocaine both good quality in one needle intravenous and do not redose until heroin wears off. thats the best you can get will live your last 10 days in pleasure and bliss.<br /><br />the only thing that will be left worrying you is next cocaine bellringer. that&#039;s the only downside of speedball - craving for a rush while heroin hasn&#039;t worn off. and addiction also.

				The perfect cocktail?<br /><br />Cocaine, MDMA and LSD<br />Cocaine, MDMA and Shrooms<br />Cocaine, MDMA and DMT<br /><br />You see where I&#039;m going with this?<br /><br />Cocaine for that pure relaxation, MDMA for the ridiculously high euphoria and bliss, and LSD/DMT/Shrooms for that glorious visual journey and happiness<br /><br />Goddamn I want all of these things in endless amounts forever. Maybe not MDMA, the comedowns might kill me in the end. But a cocaine/psychedelic mixture for life?<br /><br />nigga pls

				Must! Do! Drugs! Must! Do! Drugs! Must! D- oh. Must-do drugs, I see.<br /><br />Hmm. 10 days, here&#039;s your problem: cross-tolerance. I&#039;d love to say both LSD and shrooms but you don&#039;t want to leave the world chasing the fucking dragon.<br /><br />Shrooms vs. LSD is a tough choice. I would say shrooms because, end of life, I want spiritual content maxed. But then I&#039;ve never felt &quot;one with the universe&quot; like I have on LSD.

LSD occasions cosmic consciousness, molecular consciousness, atomic consciousness. Gaia consciousness (shrooms) is intermediate between body consciousness and cosmic consciousness.&nbsp; Cosmic consciousness is the highest level of organisation of consciousness on the panpsychist model. Anyone who thinks shrooms are &quot;more spiritual&quot; than LSD hasn&#039;t experienced the timeless unity which is the special gift of LSD to the humanity...and hasn&#039;t taken enough LSD.<br /><br />You may be afraid of big mind. LSD shows you big mind. People are scared of big mind. And thus scared of LSD which shows you big mind in the most direct manner possible... without sidetracking you on the path of MERE hallucinations.... which those who haven&#039;t glimpsed big mind confuse with spiritual experience.<br /><br />&quot;I hallucinate; therefore I have a spiritual experience&quot;....... No, you experienced phenomena. Big Mind is beyond all phenomena. The numinous is not a phenomenon.... and hence not a hallucination, a vision, etc......<br /><br />I repeat: the spiritual is not a phenomenon. It is beyond space and time.<br /><br />Mushrooms = visions, hallucinations = phenomena = maya<br />LSD = the numinous reality underlying all phenomena = Reality = spirituality<br /><br /><br /><br />
