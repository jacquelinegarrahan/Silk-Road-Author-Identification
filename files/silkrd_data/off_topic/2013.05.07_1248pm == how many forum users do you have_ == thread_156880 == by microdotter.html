				Im curious,&nbsp; <br />1) how many different forum users do you have?<br />2) why did you make new users?<br />3) are they parallel to the SR username you are using?<br />4) have you ever recognized a new username as someones old username? (not talking about exposed scammers, but normal buyers)<br /><br /><br />i will start with me:<br /><br />1 - i have 3 forum users 2 with about 200 posts and this one<br /><br />2 - opened the first same as SR user, on my first purchase i got fucked by vendor and got a&nbsp; 100% refund so i threw this one away instead of trying to fix the refund rate.<br />second one i stopped using after i shared some controversial experience on forum so i don&#039;t want to keep him active.&nbsp; &nbsp;third one is this one.<br /><br />3 -&nbsp; im still using same SR username from previous user as it have VERY GOOD STATS, lots of money spent in many purchases and 0% - 0% refunds/auto finalize rates.<br /><br />4 - i think&nbsp; some times that i can spot some username that came back on new username, not from writing as my English is not that good - but the interest they make in certain drugs and the attidue etc... :) i wonder if anyone could link my other usernames? (except for vendors that i bough from and reviewed that probably cam)<br /><br />you dont have to answer if you dont want<br />im just curious cause its a guessing game im playing with myself from time to time on the forum&nbsp; when im super high like now LOL&nbsp; :))

				thanks&nbsp; -&nbsp; i will explain 4 again - were you ever (or more than once) in a situation when you read someone posing and you are sure its a new username that being used here under diffrent usernames&nbsp; or like scammers coming backs after they have been outed (like the AWESOME and super funny MltJohn threads few months ago and canadaLTD and Gmemphis),&nbsp; some trolls,&nbsp; or just normal buyers chaining identify from time to time from which ever reason -&nbsp; i&nbsp; always Wonder if anyone could guess whats my other usernames,&nbsp; like some lottery (if i had more than 0.014BTC in my account to offer as a price&nbsp; LOL :)<br /><br />These Cathinone highs make me do stupid things even after 2mg xanax still awake :))
