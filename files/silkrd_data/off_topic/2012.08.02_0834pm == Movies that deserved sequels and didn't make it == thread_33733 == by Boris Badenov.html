				I&#039;ve been thinking that there are some socko films out there that should have had sequels made from them (and a LOT that never deserved sequels, you have your own list for that.)<br /><br />Anyway, the one that stands out for me is Chronicles of Riddick. It was so fabulously well made and so full of extraordinary images and concepts (the Underverse, the Necromongers, Elementals, etc.) Wow! I know that there was supposed to be a Chronicles 2, but I have conflicting information on whether it was actually made.<br /><br />Another is The Fifth Element, just because it was so incredibly stylish.<br /><br />BB

				The Incredibles, they even set up the end of that movie to lead into a sequel. Instead they made a fucking video game.

				If your computer is decent enough or you have an xbox, you should get the Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. It originally came out in like 2004 but they repackaged it in 2010 with completely redone graphics and a new side story, the repackaged version is called &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick:Assault on Dark Athena&quot;.<br /><br />Perhaps the most underrated game of all time, and it&#039;s probably dirt cheap by now.

				Is there a sequel to I Robot? <br /><br />I dis-like spoofs and slap stick shit like the 3 stooges is fucking retarded. The chronicles of riddick I thought was pretty good, even saw it twice. The Godfather saga was cool. Like to see a sequel to Scarface. Maybe Tony Montana raises up out of the pool of blood and says &quot;C&#039;mon! Go head! You can&#039;t kill me&quot; then kills everybody plus knocks up a crack whore and the baby grows up to be like Tony.

				I have seen Carlito&#039;s Way and it&#039;s pretty fucking good but I thought it was before scarface. I noticed a lot of the same actors as in scarface like the cuban in the hotel with the chainsaw.<br /><br />Oh yea masterblaster is a video game but it&#039;s the name of a duel character in the movie Mad Max beyond Thunderdome with tina turner and mel gibson
