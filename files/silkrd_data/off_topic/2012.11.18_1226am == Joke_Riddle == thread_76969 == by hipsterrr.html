				So as most of you know, Christy Nugs (a well known vendor of bud) chooses not to sell to anyone who hasn&#039;t had their account on SR for 7+ months.&nbsp; I contacted her recently, however, and she agreed to shoot me off a sample of her product even though I do not meet the 7+ month criterion...ON ONE CONDITION:&nbsp; that I answer the following joke which she provided to me.<br /><br />&quot;Whats the difference between a hipster and a coy fish?&quot;<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ve asked around in IRC and even asked my real life friends what they thought of the joke but no one seems able to give a confident answer!&nbsp; So now I open it up to you, forum people, with your mastery of sarcasm and trolling.&nbsp; Please try and figure this out for me...be as creative as you&#039;d like, go nuts!<br /><br /><br />**A few things to take note of:<br /><br />1) my name is hipsterrr and she&#039;s directly referencing a &#039;hipster&#039; in her joke<br />2) &#039;coy&#039; fish could very well be a play on words - it could have to do with &#039;koi&#039; fish. <br />3) there really might not be a &#039;correct&#039; answer per say, maybe she just wants to see what I can come up with

				I know loads of hipsters went and got Koi fish tattoos, its meant to be a symbol of strength LOL!. But shes a clever girl so don&#039;t think she would have misspell the word koi as coy. coy means shy or modest so a shy or modest fish? lol dunno

				to quote<br />&quot;According to Japanese legend, if a koi succeeded in climbing the falls at a point called Dragon Gate on the Yellow River, it would be transformed into a dragon. Based on that legend, it became a symbol of worldly aspiration and advancement. <br />More generally, the Japanese associate koi (also known as carp) with perseverance in adversity and strength of purpose. Because of its strength and determination to overcome obstacles, it stands for courage and the ability to attain high goals. &quot;
