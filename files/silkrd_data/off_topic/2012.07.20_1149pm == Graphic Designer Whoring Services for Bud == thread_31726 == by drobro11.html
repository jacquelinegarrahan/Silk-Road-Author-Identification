				Hi guys! To try to avoid purchasing fees and trips to the bank on my end, I&#039;m offering my skills for trade!<br /><br />I&#039;ll make you whatever you want - maybe it&#039;d neat to &quot;brand&quot; your bags with a sticker (but don&#039;t put it on the actual mailer - that&#039;d be stupid...)! Want a poster? A tee? <br /><br />I can help ya design all those things - and I&#039;m happy to work on non-SR designs needed too, of course. In that case I&#039;d work for BTC :P<br /><br />Send me a PM if you&#039;re interested. I&#039;m pretty affordable.<br /><br />************** EDIT: Here&#039;s a link to a VERY small sample of my past work :D *************************<br /><br />http://xfq5l5p4g3eyrct7.onion/view.php?image=bbb2eb5973ef0f308579daeba0c96889.jpg

				Actually, I have a good chunk of logos under my belt, but as a previous poster mentioned, to post those would risk exposing my identity.<br />What I like to do is design something for you, slap a &quot;SAMPLE&quot; watermark on it, and if you like it, you can pay me and I can send you the full sized file sans watermark. If not, you don&#039;t pay me and that&#039;s that :P<br />Hope to hear back from ya!

				<br />Update: Its been almost a week since Drobro11 and I have been working together. In the beginning I asked Drobo11 if he could design a logo based on a idea I had, he replied that he would come up with something shortly. After the first draft I asked him to rework it and make it more lively, he did so by sending me a 2nd draft. At this point I was quite happy with the logo and proceeded to discuss about the payment/commissions. We reached an agreement almost instantly and I asked him to make a few final changes to the logo, which he did. I was very happy with Drobro11`s work since on the 2nd draft so I felt comfortable to pay him in advance for the final. The final was sent to me the next day. Things moved quickly and we discussed the possibility of new ideas. Some of the ideas he put out were great and after the 1st commission, he sent rough drafts of the ideas he came up with. Upon reviewing them I commissioned a new logo based on an idea he had and was sent numerous drafts to choose from the following days. I ended up picking most of the designs, and am currently waiting on my btc deposit to pay him for 3 variants of one logo, 2 variants of another. Dobro11 has always answered my mails quickly and is a pleasure to talk to and work with. I highly recommend Drobro11 for his artwork/logo services.
