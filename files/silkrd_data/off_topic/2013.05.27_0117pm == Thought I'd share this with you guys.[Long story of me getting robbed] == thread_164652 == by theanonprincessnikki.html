				Well my birthday was on the 14th I turned 18, so I haven&#039;t tripped in a year so I decided to splash my bday money on some &#039;&#039;potent&#039;&#039; acid and xanax. Get this I ended up going to my ex boyfriends connect to cap 5 stamps I was planning on double dropping and saving the other three for a really intense triple drop once I come down. He comes in this crappy looking Honda with a bunch of random guys and his supposed &#039;&#039;connect&#039;&#039; driving. I approach the driver side and small chit chat he seems super cool tells me happy bday the son of a b***. I then gave him my 50 he was also &#039;&#039;hooking it up&#039;&#039; 10 a pop. he then hand&#039;s me this medium sized zip baggy with what it looks like to be some stamps in it, as soon as I grab it and look at them they they were obviously just little square cuttings of some sort of magazine or paper,they peel off fast in the car and yell shit like &#039;&#039;slut&#039;&#039; &#039;&#039;bitch&#039;&#039; for no fucking reason and the stupid part is I never did nothing bad to those guys and the ex boyfriend we broke up in good terms so I didn&#039;t understand. still having 120 bucks left I decided I&#039;ll just go buy the xanax from my trusty dealer. So I get 3 strips of xanax which is 30 xanax bars and a dub of weed ends up exactly 120.<br />well the deal went good but when I get these xanax I noticed it didn&#039;t have the clear coating normal GG249&#039;s have. they seemed kinda dusty and sketchy. But it was from my dealer of a long time so I trusted him but I doubted it a bit so I call him up and let him know that.He just tells me it was because a cop stopped him and he had to sit on the bag which made it humid blah blah. So I pop 2 which is a normal dose and smoke half a blunt.Nothing took 2 more which is a big dose 4 xanax bars in less than 2 hours and I feel nothing but the high the half blunt gave me.I google &#039;&#039;fake gg249s&#039;&#039; and I see a bunch of pages and pictures of dusty looking pill imprints as the ones I got and knew I got the fake ones. I call my dealer and he starts chuckling a bit and tells me everyone&#039;s been complaining and for me to just sell it and that he&#039;s sorry. I asked him for a refund and he told me just to sell them and hung up on me. All of this bad luck happening to me all at once I just thought was fucked up including right when I turned 18 the only thing that was good was the dub of weed I bought but still man shit. I just thought I&#039;d share this with you guys,just know no matter how close you think you are to someone if they have a chance to fuck you over they most likely will.<br /><br /><br />TLDR; I got ripped off 50 bucks and 100 bucks off acid and xanax people are fucking scumbags.

				&quot;How many classless dickheads does it take to rip off an 18 year old girl?&quot;<br /><br />It seems as though you have found SR and the forums just fine..&nbsp; Hopefully, your luck starts to change soon.<br /><br />I refuse to buy anywhere else, and often have people coming to ME to get shit because they know what is the deal (That I score good stuff, not that I get it from vendors on SR).<br /><br /><br />The classless dickheads in the Honda Civic will get theirs.&nbsp; Honda Civics loaded with young adult males seem to attract a decent amount of police attention.&nbsp; At least around here they do.

				Sorry to hear about that but it is the drug game after all , DO NOT TRUST ANYONE. You are young so take it as a experience. Never FE even in person until you examine. Lol nah just don&#039;t trust anyone sorry that it was your bday to.

				To all those who replied above I appreciate the kind word&#039;s fellas, I am just glad I caught on to SR I will deff not be buying from the streets again. Ah It truly was a great loss of money to me but I feel as it was a great lesson, or a slap across my ass from some spiritual being telling me to buck up and get ready for the real world ha ha. But really thank&#039;s that&#039;s the reason why I decided to post this I knew talking about it would make me feel a little better :)

				That sucks and really pisses me off&nbsp; &gt;:(&nbsp; Your story is case and point why the underground drug market sucks. The Road is way better, less chance of a rip off and zero chance of being physically assaulted. When I moved I had to look for new ganja dealers and it just wasn&#039;t worth it so i got on the road. You should stay on the road, use your real name for packages (If cops ever show up, which they shouldn&#039;t, you will have plausible deniability)and&nbsp; never FE. And another think do a DAB, concentrates will change your life&nbsp; ;D. <br /><br />Dont worry, those douche bags in the Honda will get whats coming to them

				Not sure if I would call this getting robbed.&nbsp; Scammed seems more appropriate, always a possibility when purchasing illicit substances.&nbsp; Lucy is so easy to fake to it sucks.&nbsp; Use the road at least then you can get your money back.
