				Hey guys.. which benzo should I get? I&#039;m a complete newbie to benzo&#039;s and want to give them a try..<br /><br />I can&#039;t decide between xanax, klonopin, and valium..<br /><br />is there a big difference between these 3? or are all benzo&#039;s pretty much the same?<br /><br />thanks for any help

				clonazepam, they&#039;re all pretty much the same except dosage by mg&#039;s.. clonazepam of those 3 has good taste + somewhat euphoric high.

				A friend once said to me &quot;Xanax didn&#039;t really do anything for me either. Not for anxiety or even recreation. For anxiety it&#039;s about as useful as a beer. But Klonopin...&nbsp; klonipin is like a pint and a 12 hour hug from a lost love after reuniting. Klonopin is a big warm hug. No matter what your state of mind. Xanax is cool but it doesn&#039;t give bear hugs.&quot;<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t agree more. However people who have tried both appear to be split 50/50 favoring either one or the other and your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I&#039;ve only used valium a few times but with it&#039;s very shirt duration of action, to me it feels more like klonopin only with a short &quot;hug&quot; of an hour or two at best, and significantly more impaired.<br /><br />Klonopin for me is immensely enjoyable and completely functional when not abused. Really puts me in acharming/piimpin&#039; mode as well. <br />Xanax ad valium make me a but of a asshole I&#039;ve been told and since I don&#039;t fund then very useful I just stay away from those.<br />However, 99% of my experience was with Oliver&#039;s alprazolam which may not have actually been alprazolam at all. Either way, I responded better to Xanax SR it seemed (though not nearly as well as klonopin).<br /><br />Tried flunitrazepam once and decided to go shopping. I don&#039;t remember shit really. My gf at the time told me that I pissed on her later that evening, though I&#039;m not sure about the legitimacy of the claim. I apologized. I did not drive at all and probably would have driven into the bay had I attempted to (or hurt others). I don&#039;t recommend it at all, it has zero recreational value imo and there are much safer, enjoyable benzos out there.<br /><br />

				Benzos are highly addictive. You clearly don&#039;t know shit about them... my advise is too research (a lot) or don&#039;t touch them.

				Xanax will hit you hard and fast, it&#039;s a nice benzo but it has a short half life. Clonaz will hit you pretty hard too and it has a very long half life, it&#039;s probably my favourite.<br />Valium has a super long half life but I find I have to take a lot of it to get the nice sedative effects.

				I have to say, valium / diazepam are a favourite for me... <br /><br />I call them sound pills. Because everything is sound when you&#039;re on them 8)

				thanks guys<br /><br />i&#039;m going to go with klonopin... I was thinking about getting xanax or valium just because its so cheap ($44 for 1gr of valium or 250mg xanax powder) but i don&#039;t have an mg scale so im not going to bother

				Benzo&#039;s are ALL different. They have different half life&#039;s and the effects are all different. <br />I would recommend starting on a short or medium half-life benzo with a small dose + caffeine. One effect this class of drug produces is sedation/sleep so it is good to choose one the has more musco-skeletal relaxing profiles and less sedation. For your first time take a half dosage and give it 2 hours before upping. Do yourself a favour and no alcahol, as you can loose your mind with no memories in the morning.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_benzodiazepines will provide you with the best information!<br /><br />My personal favorite is Lorazepam (Ativan) <br />Alprazolam (xanax) deserves an honorable mention, as does Temazepam (Temaze)<br /><br />-Anton

				Different people seem to suit different benzos. I always find Xanax nice.
