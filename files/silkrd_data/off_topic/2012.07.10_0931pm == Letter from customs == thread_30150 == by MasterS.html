				I&#039;m actually really curious about that largest order people have had that they just got a customs letter. New people freak out for 1 gram orders as if they are getting a kilo and while yes theoretically they might be prosecuted but not probably. Only customs letter I ever got was 8 years ago when I ordered seeds from Heaven&#039;s Stairwell (first time in my life I saw what &quot;stealth&quot; shipping was. They literally shipped the seed packages inside a dvd case that looked like a fake dvd rofl) It was a $300 seed order that I lost out on but it was no biggy. I wasn&#039;t worried that they were going to chase me down for cannabis seeds. *fades off into Overgrow nostalgia.*

				Biggest order I got a customsletter for wasn&#039;t from SR, but from a different site I used a few years back that was only for cannabis. The order customs took was for 30grams of 50/50 weed and hasch.<br />The letter said to give them a call, so I went ahead and did just that and after speaking with the customsofficer he quite litteraly said that there is nothing they can do about this since I am denying ownership, but he did warn me that I would probobly be prosecuted for it if theese types of mail kept getting intercepted adressed to me.<br />It sucks to loose your order though. Hasn&#039;t happened yet on SR&nbsp; :D
