				lately iv noticed so many people in the united states have steadily been deteriorating in their quality of life, everyone is poor, greedy and just plain rude, its an odd site to see someone helping another out just to be nice, i feel like this world or maybe just this country is turning into absolute shit, and just thinking about that makes me depressed

				I have noticed the scale goes up &amp; down when this is concerned. But as someone previously stated, it&#039;s everywhere. Well, I&#039;d say more in &quot;civilized society&quot;. Things have gotten , in some ways, easier. It&#039;s part of being human, we go through spurts of retardation. <br /><br />I just go with the flow.

				Sad to say it, but people have lost track of what really matters in life. Materialism and greed have taken over, and traditional values and common courtesy have been kicked to the kerb. When you are nice to someone, they always think you have an alterior motive. I was in a city recently enough and I over heard tourists talking about how to get to a particular land mark. Being Irish, I interrupted them and pointed them in the right direction. They proceeded to try and give me money and I was shocked. Can you not just be nice and helpful without expecting someone to compensate you for the 30 seconds of your time that they took up?!!!&nbsp; ???

				It funny how shocked people seem to be, when they talk about materialism, as if it is something new.&nbsp; We&#039;ve always been about materialism. It is just that the &quot;material&quot; has changed over the years. We&#039;ve always been greedy slobs. Times change, we do not.

				I think this can also be an issue of a place/time style thing. There&#039;s some miserable fuckers around me but I also can find some fine, fun people around me. It&#039;s all about where you are looking. <br /><br />Good luck

				...While these typess of people may increase.I find that location seems to play a major part.I can go 2 hrs from my location ,and think i was in a different state......But the biggest shock for me ,was the leaving the country and going to asia...Holy shit!!!....I just couldn&#039;t believe how selfish/rude ,my country was ..But its one of those things ,you need to experience and it changes ,your whole viewpoint on how you see people.

				Whoever said &quot;blame the Media&quot; has a good point. But it seems we (Americans, westerners, citizens of developed countries, etc. ) are chasing the wrong things - generally materialism and fame, the latter many people mix up with notoriety. Yeah, the world is getting worse, but perhaps this sort of thing is cyclic - people turn into assholes &#039;cause they think of &quot;me, me, me&quot;, and eventually as a group (or a culture / society) get burned out. I do my damnest not to give (too many) people shit, most learn to reciprocate or better yet, not to shit on others. There are times, though, where not dishing out shit is interpreted as &quot; I can just dump this off on ole&#039; bull3gern &#039;cause she&#039;ll take care of it. No. Period. And in 5 seconds your pile of shit goes in the shread box, in 10 sec I&#039;ll e-mail your boss and copy 18 other higher-up asses. But only after you dump your shit on me too often.
