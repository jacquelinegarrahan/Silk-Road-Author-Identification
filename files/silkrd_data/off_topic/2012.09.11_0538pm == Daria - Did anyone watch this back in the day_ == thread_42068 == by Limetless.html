				I remember thinking it was so radical to have a laid-back cartoon character like Daria, the scenarios they would put her in were great too. I haven&#039;t seen the show since it was on air so my memory is a bit hazy, I wonder if it&#039;s out on DVD.

				Next on Sick Sad World: Are fish using OUR oceans as their private bathrooms!?<br /><br />Ha ha. I remember that show. I used to really enjoy it when it was on. Not too long back I actually found and watched all of them. The first couple of seasons were the best / had the most solid material. They got kinda weird and unfocused.<br /><br />Ren and Stimpy was also another good one. There are certain episodes burned into my brain. I&#039;ll never forget that show.<br /><br />Beavis and Butthead Do America was also a solid movie even if you weren&#039;t a big fan of the show.

				Anyone got love for He-Man, Voltron, as far as MTV goes My favorites from the 90&#039;s were Liquid Television, the Original Real World, Headbangers Ball (my favorite), 120 Minutes, Alternative Nation, and finally last but not least.....MTV&#039;s AMP( does anyone remember that show? It was like electronica music with trippy video for background. I believe that&#039;s where I first heard Aphex Twin.

				Liquid television was the shit.&nbsp; The head, and aeon flux.&nbsp; The first season of aeon flux was great.&nbsp; The second kinda left ya wanting more.&nbsp; The story line fell short, was half heartedly done.&nbsp; The movie years later was ok, but i think it dumbed it down a bit, and explained too much of the inside story to the masses, but whatever. <br /><br />These days, everything in hollywood is a remake.&nbsp; And mtv has butchered music.&nbsp; Disney channel is just as much to blame for turning little girls into sluts as mtv.&nbsp; The shows on there are just as bad as teenage mom.&nbsp; As americans, we are an ignorant lot.&nbsp; We let our kids act like little whores, but then we&#039;re outraged at muslim states that allow marriage of young girls.&nbsp; Bunch of hippocratic christian psychobabble.&nbsp;
