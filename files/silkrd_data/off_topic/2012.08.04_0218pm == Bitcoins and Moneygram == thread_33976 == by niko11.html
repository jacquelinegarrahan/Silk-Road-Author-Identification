				Hello SR!<br />so i did some research and found out that in my country I cannot use almost all of the ways for getting Bitcoins that are listed here in the forums and in general. <br />So i realized I can use Moneygram and Westerunion here. Which one of them should i go with?<br />I was wondering how can i get the funds from moneygram/Westerunion&nbsp; to MTgox and then to SR and if it is safe. or should I just use a vendor on SR and pay him the fees?<br />Thanks a lot :)<br />

I&#039;d be happy to accept Euros though they will be converted to GBP at local rates before being banked (currently 1.27 EUR/GBP) - there is no commission on this part, you get the same value for money as someone sending GBP. <br /><br />If you&#039;d like to go ahead all you need to do is visit the below link and follow the instructions there :<br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/57b32a1924<br /><br />Any questions, feel free to send me a message.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />V.

				you can use a moneygram to put money on a mtgox account thru bitinstant.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then all you do is put bullshit information on the moneygram sheet.&nbsp; basically what you do is deposit cash into a mtgox account, then you can buy bitcoins like that with the money in your account.&nbsp; After that you can send the coins thru different ewallets.&nbsp; But the moneygram itself is fine, thats how i do it.&nbsp; I always make up a different name so its untraceable.&nbsp; if you have more questions you can PM me, and ill be glad to help.&nbsp; but just so you know, you dont have to send the moneygram to a bitcoin vendor on SR, you can just use mtgox. :)<br /><br />trainfour20<br /><br />
