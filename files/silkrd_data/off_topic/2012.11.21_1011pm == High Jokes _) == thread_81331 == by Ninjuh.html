				Here&#039;s my part of the story.<br /><br />1 night, my friends (3 of em ) came over my place and we had a smoke up session at the balcony. At that moment before we spark it up, i took out a white lighter and one of my friend freak out because of the white light. He has this myth where White Lighters are Jinx. I said fuck it and spark it up. After that, we grab our drinks and started walking to the park and we came across this cement road with tiny stone build into the cement. Its for you to walk on it, BARE FOOT. Apparently it help your blood flow better. So obviously, we took of our shoes and started walking on it. and It was the most ticklish shit ever!!! Its like walking on an alligator&#039;s back and we giggle all the way, we didn&#039;t want to laugh too loud cause it was 3am in the morning. After all the walking, came back to the house and chill at the porch. Suddenly one of my friends phone beep. Its was an email about her finals result. And Sadly she flank a paper and was pretty upset about it. Immediately, my friend said SEE I TOLD YOU ITS WAS THE WHITE LIGHTER! and He took the white light and threw it away. LOL! So, i went up and roll a joint and came back down and start singing &quot; roll roll roll a joint, twist it at the end, Light it up, take a hit, and pass it to a friend &quot;. We boost it up again. She started to paranoid because she didn&#039;t want the parents to find out and was afraid that the result will be posted to her house. And out of my insensitiveness, I said this,&quot; Oh, do you know i can ask the postman to manage your letters and take it out for you.&quot; She Replied with a face expression like there is Light at the end of the tunnel &quot;REALLY?!&quot; and i replied with a Skrillex dubstep headbagging &quot; YOU WISHED! &quot; and me and my friend started laughing of so bad until our stomach hurts and had to pee. But everything went okay with her parents and all :)<br /><br />Sorry, my English is that not good. But i hope you enjoy my story :)<br /><br />
