				<br />I got up early to see the various teams walking in the arena, after they all took their places I went back to sleep. I heard my sister talking about Atkins showing up but I couldn`t be bothered to watch more.

				I enjoyed the ceremony and was taken aback by how much effort went into it.<br />The music left a lot to be desired though!<br /><br />The Queen looked very bored I thought!

				Oh no, i am not saying that.<br />However he has not managed to stay in the lime light as long as others.&nbsp; I am not sure how true this is, but &quot;apparently&quot; there is some king of cult with those big in the music business get involved in.&nbsp; The way i heard it Eminem decided to quit, hence the reason you dont see much of him on tv.<br />Just because he has had such a huge success in the past it doesnt necessarily mean he still has all that money.<br />Of course, it could just be a part of the rumour mill.

				From what I know he has more money than ever, he realized that running a production company was much more profitable than being an artist (production companies actually keep about 95 to 98% of the profits from music sales), so he&#039;s running a huge production company now with some friends.<br /><br />A lot of other artists realise this too, such as Jay Z etc.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=32778.msg376250#msg376250">Quote from: Adasel on July 29, 2012, 04:17 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Oh no, i am not saying that.<br />However he has not managed to stay in the lime light as long as others.&nbsp; I am not sure how true this is, but &quot;apparently&quot; there is some king of cult with those big in the music business get involved in.&nbsp; The way i heard it Eminem decided to quit, hence the reason you dont see much of him on tv.<br />Just because he has had such a huge success in the past it doesnt necessarily mean he still has all that money.<br />Of course, it could just be a part of the rumour mill.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Thanks for that clarification oscar.<br />I would rather believe that than listen to all this secret society cult worship bollocks.<br /><br />I do actually like Eminem, but people have a way of swaying you off someone.&nbsp; Glad to hear he is doing well.

But, I thought is was quiet good. Danny Boyle was given a really hard task here. He had to put on a show that somehow represent us, our history, our music, our culture, our humour etc. It had to entertain and tick all the required boxes. And, it all had to be done on a budget. I only saw the first hour and the last half hour (I &quot;fell asleep&quot; in the middle, as my drug use can often make me do), but, what I did see exceeded my expectations. Really, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;d have done, given the same job to do a Danny Boyle.
