				So I gotta karma at some point from someone. Thank you, don&#039;t know what I did, but it&#039;s cool that someone appreciated it!<br /><br />Since we can&#039;t know where or when we get karma, I thought a thread for folks to post a thanks when they see that counter go up would be good. Who knows, the person you helped could come and tell you why (not that that&#039;s the point of the thread!) Please though, don&#039;t come in here screaming about your negative karma (make your own &quot;bad karma&quot; thread for that.) Anyway, I like the new system, and think it&#039;s a great addition to our (mostly ;))mature and helpful community here.<br /><br />So go ahead use this thread to just thank a member for enjoying or appreciating something you did or said here!

				I actually would like to thank everyone for the karma I have received. I really am actually surprised and appreciate the good karma, but dont understand why I have received so much thanks. I do generally try to help people out, so hopefully this means I have had some success which make me happy. <br /><br />Also, I dont understand why I have received negative karma, but would like to thank that person as well. I was kinda worried about when and why it would happen but knew it was inevitable so now that its over and done, no reason to fret about it thankfully. <br /><br />Oh also, a huge THANKS to everyone for the good karma also cause I have been allowing myself a line of H for each one :) I got two in a row last night of the pebbles for which I am very grateful<br /><br />Love you all!<br />- miRNA

				I find one of the most important emotions in life to help maintain a positive outlook is to be grateful for everything, even the bad. I mean, if we never experienced pain or stress, or never were evoked with a sense of ugliness then we would never be able to truly appreciate pleasure and happiness, or able to realize the stunning beauty in the world. without hate, one would never know the joy of the blessing of love. in this way, I am able to find some positive aspect in many of life&#039;s hardships and it keeps me from being utterly depressed all the time. <br /><br />By focusing on appreciating the simple blessings in life, like the energy, time, effort that it takes to grow and produce each and every bite of food I am blessed with, or the sheer wonder and amazement of clean refreshing potable water just a few steps away... all the way to the beauty in the living works of art, circulatory systems bursting with life out of the earth, with cycles of growth and death then rebirth in spring. All the way to the astonishment we were each initially once stars, forged in supernovas some time ago so distant one cannot possibly reasonably comprehend. <br /><br />By finding beauty in all things, or the ability to realize one&#039;s blessings in this way enables an overall respect and appreciation of life even when things are not necessarily going well. Helps remind me even at the worse, I still have it better than some unfortunate people. This then motivates me to get involved in the community when possible with soup kitchens and rebuilding after Katrina for example. I guess my point is some really positive benefits can arise just from a little conscious appreciation of how great most of us these days have life.<br /><br />I dont know if much of that made sense, but I was kinda curious if many other people have similar philosophies on appreciating life? <br />I also enjoy hearing others be grateful and was just wondering if anyone else has any thing to mention being thankful for? <br /><br />Love you all,<br />- miR
