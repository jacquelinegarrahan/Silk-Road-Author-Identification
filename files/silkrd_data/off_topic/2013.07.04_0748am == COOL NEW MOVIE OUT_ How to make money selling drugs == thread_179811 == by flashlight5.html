				Must watch cool new movie out. Can be seen on YT or various streaming sites.<br /><br />++<br /><br />Ten easy steps show you how to make money from drugs, featuring a series of interviews with drug dealers, prison employees, and lobbyists arguing for tougher drug laws.<br /><br />++<br /><br />A shockingly candid examination of how a street dealer can rise to cartel lord with relative ease, How to Make Money Selling Drugs is an insider&#039;s guide to the violent but extremely lucrative drug industry. Told from the perspective of former drug dealers, and featuring interviews with rights advocates Russell Simmons, Susan Sarandon, and David Simon (creator of &quot;The Wire&quot;), the film gives you the lessons you need to start your own drug empire while exposing the corruption behind the &quot;war on drugs.&quot; (c) Tribeca Films<br /><br />++<br /><br />

				Will watch it later. Not that I want to be some drug lord! Fuck that! I don&#039;t want to sleep with an automatic gun or wear a bullet proof jacket going to the shops!<br /><br />Historically, reaching the top of the drug game is a ticket to jail or an early grave. The drug game is swarming with informants and robbers who &#039;rip and run&#039; which means they rob drug dealers. And if you have a few kilos of coke in the house, you cannot call the police. People would kill you for a kilo of coke, actually, even a few ounces. <br /><br />As for Mafias, the USA Italian Mafias are living in a world of super surveilance, the hi tech shit out there means that communications will be compromised at any top level. Most of the new guys are fucked up on drugs and unreliable. The cops KNOW all the main players and there are enough informants to let them know about the new generations looking to run things. <br /><br />Also, with all that money, you might end up miserable. Everyone will want a piece of it and your a target even with your own guys. Even in the UK we have teenagers who will shoot anyone. If you have a name for drugs - your a target in your own local area. Most people in the drug game rise from the bottom which means they will have a reputation in their own area. Some have reputations for just dealing, others are phychopaths who find a natural level in the drug game. <br /><br />The clever ones, they deal direct with the source and have a customer base that is loyal and goes way back. <br /><br />Earning money from drugs is down to who you know. IF I knew someone in Morrocco then I could visit the Riff Mountains and buy a few kilos of the finest hash. If you don&#039;t know anyone there you get robbed. <br /><br />Same with coke. Anyone who knows someone in SA could get it sent easily. I&#039;d hate to sell coke as the customer base is prone to robbing you!<br /><br />As a cannabis smoker, the game is different but people will shoot you for a kilo of bud. Drugs = money + no police. That is tempting for the gangs of robbers who prey on drug dealers. <br /><br />I keep away from the drug scene and don&#039;t want a name or rep even for smoking. <br /><br />I&#039;m lucky as I go way back with my go to guys and girls. We have been posting for decades! SR was not the first and many UK&#039;ers will have worked out things that way. Emails, clearnet websites, lol, things have changed so much but a few sellers still stick to Ebay - selling actual legal goods but certain customers, are shopping for bud, hash or oil. <br /><br />And sorry, no way does that information go out to the public!<br /><br />There are sellers on Amazon and every clearnet auction site.<br /><br />Journalists are fixated on SR. <br /><br />I know this much. Most journalists on here are not investigating SR, they are getting in supplies for the wk-end!<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />Be well.

Honestly, that&#039;s just not how it&#039;s done these days. The cartels are the only ones fucking it up for the rest of us, here in America. The Mob is pretty hands-off with drugs(American Mafia, I mean). They used to leave it to the cartels and the hood. Every time someone in the Mob gets involved with large drug trafficking, there&#039;s a lot of unnecessary blood shed; so those days are long over.<br /><br />I&#039;m not at the top, by any means, but I&#039;m well versed in the trade. Most of what these trafficking organizations have done since the 80&#039;s and 90&#039;s is take the movement of, and the distribution of drugs out of the hands of the Cartels. Mainly, by sourcing to and from online shops and discussion boards like this. Jack N Hoff seems to understand, albe-him a troll(lol) --that this is the way things are done. And have been done for some time now(long before SR).<br /><br />Silk Road is the tip of the Iceberg glimmering out of the top of the deep-sea... <br /><br />From my time in the game, I will tell you... there are TWO definite black markets. The violent, dying out, black market of the past... and the non-violent, growing, black market of today and tomorrow. I cannot by any means go into detail, but a lot of powerful money has gone into the drug trade; to fund labs, grows, shipments, etc. and hurt the Cartels where it matters most. Some of the very same people who have made the necessary political pushes to legalize and decriminalize cannabis in states across the nation. <br /><br />Violence in this game is the past; not the future. It takes a lot of strong will and courage to make that true.
