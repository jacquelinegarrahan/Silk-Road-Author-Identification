				Honestly I barely remember the first one. I might have seen it once and turned it off or became disinterested, I would have been too young to enjoy it at that time. It was okay. Like I said, I went with the wife who didn&#039;t really care for it. I am still trying to wrap her head around the term Orwellian. I need to read her a cliffs notes of 1984 sometime.
