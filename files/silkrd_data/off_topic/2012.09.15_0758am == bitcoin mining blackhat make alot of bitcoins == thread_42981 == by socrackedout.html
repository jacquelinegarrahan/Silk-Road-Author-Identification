				I would advise anybody downloading this to put it on a USB stick / memory card and transfer it to a computer with no internet access before opening it.

				Make lots <br />of Bitcoins <br />Guide <br /><br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 1 <br /><br />Introduction <br /><br /><br />This eBook is to show how easy it is to make lots of <br />bitcoins without doing any hard work or even mining on <br />your own pc! I&#039;m making around 6 to 15 BTC a day <br />from this method, and it will work for anyone that takes <br />the time to set it up. What you will be setting up is what I <br />call a &quot;mining ring&quot; and what it does is make other <br />computers mine bitcoins for you, so the more computers <br />you put your miner on the more bitcoins you will make! I <br />will be showing you step by step on how to set <br />everything up just follow along. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 2 <br /><br /><br />Things You Will Need <br /><br />WinRAR- Download Here <br />A TripleMining Account- Signup Here <br />Youtube Account -Signup Here <br />Silent Bitcoin Miner Builder- Download Here <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 3 <br /><br /><br />Step 1 <br /><br /><br />Download WinRAR, UTorrent, and Silent Bitcoin Miner. <br />Install WinRAR and UTorrent, and leave the miner alone for <br />now. You also will need to sign up for a pool. I will be using a <br />Triple Mining Account. <br />After you are done registering for your account and logged <br />in click the &quot;Account&quot; tab. This is where you will find your <br />account info and how many bitcoins you are making and things <br />of that nature. You can also change your payout address, <br />account password and email address associated with your <br />account here. . <br /><br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 4 <br /><br /><br /><br />Now navigate to the &quot;Workers Tab&quot; now here is where <br />you will be setting up your worker information. On the <br />top left you will see where it says Add Worker. Think of <br />what you will like to call your worker and type it into <br />worker name. Next type in a password for your worker <br />and click add worker. REMEMBER OR WRITE DOWN <br />THAT NAME AND PASSWORD YOU WILL NEED IN THE <br />FOLLOWING STEPS. <br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 5 <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now go to the stats tab this is where you will see your <br />Hash speed. &quot;Pretty much showing how fast your <br />workers are mining. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 6 <br /><br />Step 2 <br /><br />Ok, this step I will be showing you how to set up <br />your miner. A Silent bitcoin miner builder is a special <br />modified miner that builds silent undetectable miners for <br />you to spread and mine coins for you. <br />So now use winrar to unzip silent bitcoin miner to the <br />desktop. <br /><br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 7 <br /><br />Open it up its going to ask you to enter your mining pool <br />look at the picture above and fill all your information in <br />and when it ask you Enable GPU Mining this just means <br />do you want to mine also using graphic card enter yes <br />and it will cpu and gpu mine. Gpu is faster than cpu. Now <br />press enter and it will build a miner for you to spread to <br />lots of computers. Now you probably are wondering how <br />I&#039;m going to do that? Well head over to step 3 to see my <br />favorite methods of spreading my miner! <br /><br />Step 3 <br /><br />Now it&#039;s time to spread your miner. Go to <br />www.mediafire.com and upload/host your miner. Get a <br />link to download your miner. <br />Ok, now one of my spreading methods is YouTube. I <br />go to youtube and search for like card generators or any <br />video that has to do with downloading a file in the <br />description. I then download that video using YouTube <br />downloader to my computer and upload it to my account <br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 8 <br /><br />on YouTube as if I made the video. Then in the <br />description you put something like: heres the link to <br />download (put your link from mediafire.) Now all you do <br />is let it sit people will this your miner is a program they <br />want and download it. If you got a good video with <br />something a lot of people want you will get lots of <br />downloads. Also you can go to www.enhanceview.com <br />to make your YouTube video popular quick. <br />Another great way to spread is through torrents. <br />Upload your miner to a few torrents sites and name it a <br />different file that a lot of people want! <br /><br />Im making 5-10 Bitcoins a day from this and get 2500 <br />MH/s. This works perfectly if you spread right. If you <br />need more help send me a message at <br />allconsolehacks@gmail.com <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Make Lots of Bitcoins <br />Page 9
