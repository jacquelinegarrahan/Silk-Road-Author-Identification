				I was planning on ordering some herb today. My neighbor, who&#039;s down with this, wants in on it. I already had my coins in my account but had to get cash from him, turn it into coins and transfer them to my account.<br /><br />I go to his place because I need his printer. I was going to do a bitinstant transaction via Western Union and had to print the details to take to walmart. I also planned on using instawallet in the middle so I snapped a pic of the wallet page on my phone for later reference.<br /><br />Got the whole thing done, even bought a pair of pants and a shirt at walmart after the western union transaction cuz I was just feeling good.... Went home, go to check the wallet and see that I photographed only the bitcoin address and not the url from bitinstant. You cannot access the former without the latter. Fuck, I lost my neighgor&#039;s money!

				were you on instawallet in your Tor browser? if you were using your reg browser, the address should still be in your history.<br /><br />and don&#039;t worry, you don&#039;t have to kick yourself in the face, I&#039;m sure your neighbor will take care of that when he finds out you lost his money.

				What probably happened was you scammed his ass and now you&#039;re posting this shit on the forum because you know he will see it. In your peabrain-mind you think this will justify your story and he can&#039;t possibly be lied to by his neighbor since it was posted on a forum.

				Also I thought bitinstant didn&#039;t even do WU, they only did moneygram which when you pay it the software automatically sends it to your bitcoin address you had to enter before you printed out that shit.

I immediately called him and told him to pull up his history. He said he deleted history, like he always does after each session. Probably be cause he spends most of his time flirting with traps on FB xD<br /><br />I went back there and searched&nbsp; the best I could - looked at his *.plist files, downloaded software to recover... history was just gone.<br /><br />I emailed bitinstant and pleaded that they do what they explicitly say they won&#039;t do on their site - recover a url from a bitcoin address. Too many scammers. <br /><br />I did tell them that I could provide sufficient proof. Maybe they&#039;ll help. If not, I&#039;m either going to just buy what I can afford with the coins have or kick in another 80 bucks and don&#039;t all again. Either way, I&#039;ll give him the same amount.

I have good stats and buy all I need. Cuz I&#039;m an adult, with a professional job that pays six figures. Call me what you want but based on my posts, although few, and my buyer stats, this is completely unwarranted and childish. So, go suck a big fat dick, I&#039;m done here, troll.

				You&#039;re a fucking joke, kid. Who brags about how mature they are and how much money they make? Let me tell you, kids who don&#039;t actually make that money and they&#039;re not that mature. You are the child here and you just proved that by your reactions, fact. You&#039;re far to emotionally challenged to be older then 25 and that&#039;s just a straight up fact. You&#039;re not ready for the internet. I suggest you get off of here before mommy and daddy catch you.

				What happens to the money? Does InstaWallet take it eventually? Does it just sit there for the next fifty years, or more?<br /><br />Imagine that - in fifty years time, when a Bitcoin is worth $100000, and you then find a small scrap of paper under the wardrobe with the URL written on it, &quot;oh yer!

				Hey Zen, are you a Pirsig fan? I liked Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance but enjoyed Lila much better. Did you read that one? It isn&#039;t written as well as the other, but he explains the concepts in greater depth. I especially liked his ideas on static versus dynamic quality. I still find that philosophy useful when dealing with people in business today.
