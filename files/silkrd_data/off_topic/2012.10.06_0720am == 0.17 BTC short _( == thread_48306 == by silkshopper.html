				Hi guys,<br />Tomorrow will be the 7th anniversary of my account being locked for forgetting my pin (still doubt that I set one, anyway...) and so hopefully I will be able to finally order some nice buds I&#039;ve been wanting.<br /><br />Here is the problem: I have 3.69BTC in my SR account. Now I can ALMOST get 2 grams of bud @ 1.81 ea + .12 postage each. That comes to 3.86. 3.86-3.69 = 0.17 short.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure you all know how much of bitch it is to reload MtGox so I have to.... will someone pretty please donate me 0.17 Please... :&#039;(<br />My addr is: 1Buy7iShFbVKDD4ov2oqxvcn3pY8erPhEA<br />I want to be able to order as soon as my account is unlocked.<br /><br />PS: If you donate please post a reply so that others don&#039;t donate too. I&#039;m an honest person I don&#039;t want to receive more than I need. Thanks.<br />This can be loan too but only if no interest and you don&#039;t mind waiting for like a month.

				Maybe if you had more forum rep people would be more likely to do this. For now, maybe somebody would do it! I was going to do it, until I seen you only had 2 posts. For all we know, you could just run with the money and never post on SR again. Or just make a new SR account since it&#039;s so easy.

				PM me your SR username and I can help you out. Even if you are a scammer, you aren&#039;t going to make any money off $3 a pop, so I&#039;ll give it to you just cause it&#039;s funny. Not that I&#039;m saying you are, I&#039;m sure you&#039;re a fine upstanding gentle(wo)man&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />But a tip for the future: STOP USING MTGOX. IT SUCKS. www.bitinstant.com, man. Deposit cash using a fake name at a shop, get bitcoins in your SR wallet less than 10 hours later. It costs a little, but it&#039;s waaaay better than MtGox, especially with all the shit they and Dwolla make you do now
