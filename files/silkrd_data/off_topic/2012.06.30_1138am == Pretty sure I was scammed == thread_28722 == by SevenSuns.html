				Im fairly new to the road and my first couple transactions went great. I had my last few coins from mining and decided to spend them on some psys. Whats funny is I hesitated to buy from a new vendor who now has a great rating. Ordered some 2c-i on the 17th and it still hasn&#039;t shipped from someone who has a mid 90s rating, but is now on the selective scammer list. Its such a crappy feeling even if I can get my money back(unlikely as I finalized early). Anyone else recently get scammed and feeling sad? :&#039;(<br /><br />Something I was wondering about was my buyer stats, what if I got scammed and had to get a refund? With my 3 purchases that would give me a 33% refund rate and make me look awful. Does SR have an option for clearing that up? Also what does it take to actually ban a scammer because this guy still has open listings even though he is on the list.<br /><br />

				I finalized early like I said above. He said in PM that it isn&#039;t shipped yet so we will see, either way still sucks to wait this long when his page clearly says 3 days processing.

Let me get this straight. You think you have been scammed because his name is on a list, possibly from a disgruntled buyer, and he hasnt processed before he says he would?

				No multiple people have posted recently about him and haven&#039;t gotten anything. Its still possible its not a scam which is why I haven&#039;t posted his name and started bitching all over about it. Its been over 2 weeks(17th) with no shipment, slow responses, and multiple excuses. I am hoping at this point he is just having lots of really bad problems and not good at handling volume or something.<br /><br />edit:<br />Also he has already marked it in transit and the order is through with on the page. Can&#039;t enter resolution or anything at this point so I really think he might be slow.
