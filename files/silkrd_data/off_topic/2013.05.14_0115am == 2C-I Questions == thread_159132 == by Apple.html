				I will be trying 2C-I, for the first time, sometime next week (hopefully) and I do not know how much I should take. Can anyone help me out with this? Also, what are the effects? I know it&#039;s a psychedelic drug, so does it resemble the effects of LSD and/or shrooms?

				I would say around 20mg is a good dose, 15mg if you want to play it safe. This is orally of course, not sure about snorting it.

				Definitely don&#039;t snort, will fuck you big time, burn your nose and immediate strong hit.....have never done it myself but had a few friends who did it and regretted it. Was a big user for a year or two, did it orally every weekend. Must say never measured doses, would wet the tip of my little finger and dip it into my bag. After a while got to know the right amount tho had a lot of varied experiences...due to varying dosages along the way.<br /><br />I&#039;d suggest going with a lowish dose and progressing. It can be great fun but remember it lasts up to 8 - 10 hours, so if you&#039;re fucked your fucked for a long time. Fantastic with music. Should add I used to drink with it as well to help with the initial &quot;come-up&quot; and &quot;body load&quot;. That was probably the most disconcerting aspect to it. That for first hour or two particularly with large doses, then it was cruise mode.<br /><br />For me with a good dose I&#039;d merge with the music, and the emotional intensity of the music/song. Wouldn&#039;t say it was strongly hallucinogenic but had some awesome experiences on it.<br /><br />Not familiar with other psychedelics such as acid and mushies so can&#039;t comment.

				Yeah, don&#039;t snort if you&#039;re a beginner. Check out what happened when I snorted 2C-P:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=84814.msg622242#msg622242

				Me and my friends tried &#039;keying&#039; some unmeasured amount of it out of the baggie and snorting it. A single key absolutely wrecked us all. The burn wasn&#039;t anywhere near as bad as 2c-b (it was very bearable), and we were peaking hard in 15-20 minutes. It hit a lot harder than expected. One of the four of us couldn&#039;t handle it and ended up having a bad trip and getting arrested. We&#039;re talking going insane here, like jumping in front of cars. He didn&#039;t even remember it in the morning. Two of us had a great time, with amazing visuals and a very psychedelic headspace (we didn&#039;t know what had happened to the other two). <br /><br />So, yeah. Don&#039;t snort an unmeasured dose. Quite obvious advice really haha...

				I only snort my 2C chemicals because I like a strong trip.&nbsp; 60mg of 2C-i snorted is pretty nice and strong.&nbsp; If you&#039;re too pussy for that route, anally is even stronger than snorting.&nbsp; A good and easy technique is to put it in a capsule, wet the capsule and put it up your butthole about two inches.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a completely different drug.&nbsp; Eating 2C chemicals is a waste, but hey its piss cheap so throw it in the air, make it rain, flush it down the toilet, eat it, hell... do whatever you want. :)

				P.S.&nbsp; The trip will hit you after about 15-20 minutes when you decide you&#039;re tired of having what feels like a small small turd in your butt and you go try to poop it out.&nbsp; Nothing will come out but you will start tripping fucking balls while sitting on the toilet trying to take a shit.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen it happen to many people and that is how it happens every time.&nbsp; Pretty funny shit.&nbsp; I think it probably has something to do with your anal sphincter muscles squeezing on the melting capsule in your rumphole.

				Not to offense to anyone, but one thing I will NEVER do in my life is stick something up my ass lol. In my opinion, feeling &quot;high&quot; is an effect that does not change, regardless of the type of consumption.

				Please just do the proper research yourself and you will have a good time. I recommend 20mg orally for a solid trip but you will not go insane. lol<br />Sounds like you have never done a psychedelic before, is that true?<br /><br />I&#039;m laughing pretty hard at the anal comments hahaha

				I received a really nice review in my inbox an hour ago. The customer only took half of the $6 sample of 2C-i that I sent him and apparently my gear is quite strong. ;D I don&#039;t know why they sent me the review instead of posting it for others to see but here it is. I took a screenshot to show that I am not making this review up. http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/igUH.jpg<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A++ review. I have never given a post-experience on the road so apologies if this this is in bad form or. To that point everything else I pretty much know excactly what to expect and its either good or bunk. I enjoyed the listing and took a 10 mile walk this afternoon. Temperatures peaked at 97 degrees F half way into the excursion. Objects did tend to shift while circumnavigating , but I began to accept this as the norm and not to be taken seriously. I was never lost or disoriented which sometimes happens under normal conditions anyways as I walk through a very complicated network of interconnected islands. (Smartphone apps can always lead the way home if needed). All the same I would not attempt to ride the Harley under these conditions which is something I normally enjoy under mild shroomage and a moonlit night. Recent rain had left damp sidewalk patterns which took a life of their own. Plants that that had never been noticed, were and stood out in brilliant clarity. No significant anxiety.... I arrived home with responsibilities ahead of me for the afternoon but walls still melting and anything in &quot;print&quot; was either scrolling or scrambling or jumping up and down. At at this point It was ACID with no introspection. I employed on-hand Responsible countermeasures to achieved early termination and succeeded inside of 30 minutes. I Felt guilty for this blatant waste but wouldn&#039;t consider this a sentimental substance to begin with. I have a precision scale and won&#039;t go into details, but certainly see the benefits of only passing something like this on in single dose qty&#039;s or to someone who can be trusted to measure accurately and behave responsibly. Sorry don&#039;t mean this as a judgment but will say my ride was significantly more intense and longer than I would have expected (given my research) and I limited things to 15mg. Anyway good stuff and thanks.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This wasn&#039;t their first time using it. :)
