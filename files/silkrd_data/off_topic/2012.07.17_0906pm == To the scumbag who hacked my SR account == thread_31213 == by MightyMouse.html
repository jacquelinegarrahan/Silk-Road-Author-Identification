				you really should have taken the few BTC i have an went away, your greed of seeing im trying to exchange for more lead you to lose out on the few bucks you coud have gotten as ive changed my pass . My pin wouldnt have been that hard to crack altho would have taken you some time.&nbsp; Lesson learned not to use items that can be guessed easly. still very funny ;)<br /><br />it started with me sending a message to someone, once the message was sent i jumped into my sent box an was kicked back to the main login screen. after trying for 5 minutes to log in i was unable, i took a few breaths an tryed once more an boom i was in but a few messages ive gotten in that time where read an i know i didnt read them. <br /><br />changed pass an pin, case closed. your a scumbag an your going home empty handed.

				Could be a simple PHP error, doesn&#039;t sound like you were hacked. It&#039;s nearly impossible to hack someones Silk Road account or brute force the password due to the caphta and time outs. <br /><br />The only way you can really get your account hacked is to find the Silk Road address from Wikipedia where some idiot has changed it to a phishing page they have made purposely to steal your username and password. This is why you should bookmark or mentally memorize the address.

				The SR site is absurdly easy to memorize well any are really but they made it extra easy. I memorized the forum one after the second time I typed it. This just reminded me that because of cellphones I no longer have most numbers memorized instead of having dozens. Damn lack of use.
