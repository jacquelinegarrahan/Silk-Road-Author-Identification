				Fit Italian-American women that live in New York and need to get fucked. This is the one thing that America has that Britain needs.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Start exporting them please. I am in the market for wholesale.&nbsp; ;)

They fuck like animals apparently.. but the attitude is almost not worth it. <br /><br />I couldn&#039;t deal with that shit personally. I&#039;d probably get done for domestic violence within about 20 minutes.<br /><br />Another thing that New York needs to export is their fucking pastrami and Jewish Deli&#039;s. I&#039;ve watched enough Man vs Food to get a serious craving for that shit. So much so that I went out and bought the ingredients and tried to emulate it. Was fucking amazing but not a scratch on the shit in that show.

				Katz deli downtown in alphabet city, manhattan. Expensive as fuck but they put so much pastrami on the sandwich you need to smoke a nice fat joint before you even try to attempt eating it or you&#039;ll never make it.

				I have always viewed the UK and the US as brothers in the sense we here in the US come from the UK for the most part when it is all traced back but I would not be envious of anything here. <br /><br />The freedom they fought for&nbsp; and to gain independence back then is no longer alive. The founding fathers here warned&nbsp; &nbsp;about everything that would happen&nbsp; if the people did not stand true to their beliefs and sure enough that is exactly where we are today. From the baking systems to the freedom to pick and choose what we do with our own bodies. It All started&nbsp; with the civil war. History is a marvelous thing and that is why the founding fathers said all citizens should be ready to revolt against this country if and when such a thing happens. The people are sheep. Most anyways. I hate to speak in absolutes but most just hear or read something and assume it is true.<br /><br />I love my country but I hate my government. I would love an extended visit to the UK. But if any of us want true freedom we better find a Delorian&nbsp; with a flux capacitor .<br /><br />This site is the first real example I have seen of a revolt and someone standing up for their rights. It is not all about drugs and getting high to some it is about the freedom and the will and right to do these susbstance in our own pursuit of happiness. In the words of stan lee&nbsp; &quot;NUFF SAID&quot;&nbsp;
