				I&#039;m out, never nbome 25i, the dosage is uncertain, I took what was 1mg per &#91;] complexed, sublingual, saw death up close, to outside!<br />I was hospitalized with severe cardio-respiratory, very uncertain that substance, not nominate anyone, many people will die of it there yet, write what I&#039;m saying and will put blame on the molecule, LSD yes this is magical, 25x Nbome to outside!<br /><br />No joke bro, after today I&#039;m here to recover researching cases of overdoses on this drug, it is unusual, a lot of people dying, not to make sure the amount that causes an overdose, or the amount contained in these blotters, repeat and warning guys, who will be using guinea pig like me, really knows anything about this drug.

				I just saw a thing about a kid who died from it.&nbsp; It happened pretty quick too from the sound of it.&nbsp; Best stick with things that are known to be safe.

				Drugs are a death thing. Every drug has it&#039;s fatalities per year. They haven&#039;t been able to link marijuana itself to any deaths yet. MDMA has so many deaths per year but people who love it are not going to give it up any time soon. Everybody reacts differently to different drugs. If this were really an epidemic then wouldn&#039;t it be all over the local news in every town in America? or all over the world?<br /><br />Yea the nbomes are still fairly new so people who try it are taking a chance that they may have an allergic reaction or anything. You are right that there is a lot to be learned still yet. I don&#039;t think that 25i has reached the amount of deaths per year that aspirin has. Thank you for spreading the warning and being safety cautious
