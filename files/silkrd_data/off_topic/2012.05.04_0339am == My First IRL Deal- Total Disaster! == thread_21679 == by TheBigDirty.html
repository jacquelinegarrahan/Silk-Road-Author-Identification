				So I&#039;ve been selling dope online for a month or so now and I love to sell out every harvest within days of the buds being cured.&nbsp; I want to put out the best product imaginable so i sell it quick whilst its fresh. Well anyhow, this harvest, boy I pulled quite a haul.&nbsp; I felt unable to move it all quickly thru my relatively new account.&nbsp; <br /><br />So i was walking in the mall and i bumped into a old acquittance i used to work with and buy dope from.&nbsp; I mentioned that i had some weight and if he was interested.&nbsp; We agreed on a price and I told him I&#039;d have it in 2 weeks.&nbsp; This would be my first time actually doing a real life deal.&nbsp; You know other than buying grams and quarters.<br /><br />I did some research and decided i would do the barry cooper method.&nbsp; But first a word about this dude.&nbsp; He doesn&#039;t run the smartest operation.&nbsp; He has dudes come to his house and stick money thru the window screen and out come the drugs.<br /><br />He was all like dude just come drop the dope off at my house.&nbsp; I was movin 2P and i was nervous about all kinds of shit.&nbsp; So against my better judgement i go to his house carrying the heavy.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I get there i go in his house and he&#039;s got a bunch of friends there.&nbsp; And then one of them runs up and hits me in the head grabs my dope.&nbsp; Another guy tackles me and they start beating on me.&nbsp; They kicked me right in the ass on my way out and i fell down the front steps and my shoes came off.<br /><br />WTF should I do?&nbsp; I can&#039;t go to the cops or anything.&nbsp;

				Get your boys, and gear the fuck up. Bust his fucking door in and start spreading lead. Then ransack the place. You&#039;ll have 3 minutes minimum, 8 is more likely. <br /><br />Or burn his fucking house down. Molotov style.<br /><br />Or, a personal favorite, if he has kids or a wife, take a picture of them at school or work, then drop them off at his house with your phone number.<br /><br /><br />Be a heartless fuck. People that pull this shit piss me off. Personally, I&#039;d chain all his doors, or use quicrete to seal them shut, same with the windows. Then I&#039;d light his house on fire at the four main corners and toss a molotov on the roof. Then leave. <br /><br />But that&#039;s just me.

				Time to man up and do what these guys suggested. The guy doesn&#039;t seem very bright dealing drugs from his house like that. Probably wasn&#039;t a good idea to drop off two pounds there either but whats done is done.<br /><br />Personally I suggest the Molotov approach. Effectively fucking his place of business.

				Get a cheap burner cellphone and anon tip the cops to that guys house that he is selling drugs from. Just say you are a concerned citizen or neighbor that witnessed him selling drugs from his house. He burned you, you turn him in. Try to stake out the house, and have the cops catch him while he is dealing during a busy day.<br /><br />I know you guys might read this and say, &quot;thats the snitch-rat way!&quot; But fuck it, make the cops work for you, heh.<br /><br />umm you got the idea first cx, lol. just as I was typing it.... +1 karma to you for beating me ;D

				Personally I&#039;d leave it for 6 months then totally out of the blue pay some people to break his legs. In the mean time he will have probs fucked over other people and will not be sure its you. Being tough isnt about going in gung ho, it&#039;s about picking the right time to do what needs doing. If you had a big presence on the street you;d just have to smash that fucker soon. But as you deal online there is no rush to get back at him.

				Education is never cheap.

When you have them alone in the dark beat the fuck outa them with a heavy bat. go for the knee first so they cant run away.

				At least you learned your lesson. Don&#039;t sell weight to a crackhouse, especially if you&#039;re alone and unarmed.<br /><br />If these people know you at all, and if they are well connected, I would advise against doing anything to them any time soon, especially if they aren&#039;t known for robbing people often. Even if you wait a few weeks, they may still come after you if they did a robbery just this one time and even somewhat suspect you for retaliating. Ratting them out may be less conspicuous than trying to do serious damage, but it carries its own risks and you&#039;re still a rat for doing it, IMO. On one side, they may never even know that someone dropped a tip on them. However, if they even suspect that you had something to do with that, they will either rat on you in return and mention that you have a grow (if they can actually tell the bud was homegrown despite whatever you told them), or they&#039;ll pay someone to go after you the same way people have been advising you to go after the them.<br /><br />Now if these are just regular young adult or teenage junkies or some other &quot;soft target&quot; with no access to hitmen or guns, you can carry out one of these revenge fantasies if you have the balls, and the means. Assuming that they wouldn&#039;t be intimidated enough if you throw the main douche in the back of a car and put a gun in his mouth, one may have to take them all out. It&#039;s time to go commando. Dammit, you know what I mean.<br /><br />One might order some tear gas grenades online, along with a gas mask and some flashbang materials (50/50 Potassium perchlorate/aluminum &lt;--- google &quot;flash powder&quot; before you try anything and use 50:50 not 70:30 ratio). Pay with a money order that you purchased from a shop without cameras then wiped clean of prints together with the stamp/envelope, and don&#039;t ship to your house or anywhere with cameras. Get some tactical gear resembling SWAT, maybe a loud police scanner, and last but not least, a semi-auto rifle or SMG (at LEAST 9MM) that is cleaned and properly sighted. If you aren&#039;t proficient with it, learn somewhere where no one can see you. Once you can reliably hit moving targets at a MINIMUM of 20 yards, you are &#039;minimally ready&#039;.<br /><br />To put this plan into motion, one would have to pick a date when the house has the least amount of people in it at a time when almost everyone in the neighborhood is asleep, like 3AM. Watch it for months if necessary. When the time comes, leave your cell phone at home, then proceed to park at least 5-6 blocks away from the target, preferably on a quiet residential street where your car is hard to see from windows. Make sure you know exactly how many people are inside the crackhouse That&#039;s how many bodies you will need to count at the end. Grab your gym bag with the equipment and a clean change of clothes (something conservative you have never worn and will never wear again), and set up a position somewhere nearby within viewing range. Once as many people are inside as possible, sneak up to a window near whatever area they congregate in, and get ready to throw in as many flashbangs and tear gas spraying implements as possible. If you can, completely barricade whatever door you think is best for the situation, ie. block the front door if the back yard is dark with no escape (but you can still see enough to aim). Throw in the shit, turn on your scanner, and yell &quot;POLICE, SEARCH WARRANT&quot;. Stand by the remaining exit and just cap anyone who runs out. At least two shots, one to the chest followed by one to the head. Once the stream of runners stops, walk through the door (you ordered that freakin gas mask, right?) and sweep the house. This should all take less than 3 minutes, from the time the window breaks to the last person. Trust me, everyone will be running for the exit and very quickly too. Listen for windows breaking and run around to catch any stragglers. They will be stunned and breathless, so don&#039;t expect them to run far. At this point, one can either exit immediately or steal as much shit as possible. Just make sure you can be out after 5 minutes total (that police scanner comes in handy here, but I wouldn&#039;t wait around cops or no cops due to eyewitnesses waking up). Sprint somewhere nearby and out of sight then calmly change your clothes and walk to the car, which really should be stolen for this purpose. DO NOT go straight home. Once you are back, dispose of everything. Cut things into little pieces and burn them, then flush the ashes into the sewer or something. Grind the weapon down into dust if you can, then dissolve in acid and flush. Easier said than done, but hey, this whole story is about as realistic as singing dog shit, so who cares? #1 piece of advice: TELL NO ONE and DO NOT TALK TO COPS AT ALL. Wipe your hard drives afterwards too, and never use tor again. If you aren&#039;t retarded and wore gloves and something to cover your head (SWAT helmet?), there will be little evidence left behind. If you somehow have the time to collect the shell casings and tear gas grenades, that&#039;s even better. Assuming the rest goes perfect as well and you never told anyone about the robbery or revenge plot, odds are you may actually get away with it. It&#039;ll be nerve wracking to see your actions all over the national news (possibly international LOL), and there is a good chance you&#039;ll be questioned as word of the robbery definitely reached others by now. Don&#039;t try to deny anything, just act pissed off and ask for a lawyer. Play it off like you&#039;re glad they were taken care of and don&#039;t want to cooperate.<br /><br />Well, that was fun to write. Obviously, this isn&#039;t meant to be taken seriously and has many holes and missing &quot;steps&quot;. If you did something like this before, then you might find some things interesting. Then again, if you are ex-military or do hits for a living, I doubt you&#039;d be asking for advice&nbsp; :).

				Continuing with the non serious revenge brainstorming, why are you guys so intent on doing it loudly? The OP doesn&#039;t sound like fucking Rambo, chasing that kind of heat by himself would never work. Get creative, how about finding some sort of obscure poison and getting it into their water supply or food?<br /><br />Now that I think about it, firebombing the house from a car would probably be the most best destruction/ease of execution ratio.

				You&#039;ve just to think of 1 thing here:<br /><br />- Do you want to keep doing RL business?<br /><br />If yes:<br /><br />You HAVE to fuck that guy. I&#039;d that once back in the days I was a street dealer, it&#039;s part of the business. Get him alone or a group of mates and do &quot;some repairs&quot; on his face, then ransack all his dope and money. If you don&#039;t, as word hits the street, you&#039;ll be everybody&#039;s bitch.

				If he knows where you live or knows how to contact any of your friends or anyone with information on you, then don&#039;t even bother trying to steal back from him or beating the shit out of him, it&#039;s a viscous circle of him repeating the same to you or worst, or at the very least you constantly having to look over your shoulder.<br /><br />Murder is the only answer for bitches like these. Don&#039;t get fancy anything, depending on the location around his house, if it&#039;s feasible then the best option is staking out his front door, rifle shot as he walks in or out. If you have experience with a pistol that&#039;s an option but unless you have a .45 or .38s or similar then count on multiple shots at very close range, so more risk. With a rifle you can do it from your car and immediately drive away. Obviously make sure it&#039;s not a car he knows, borrow or rent a car in someone elses name, tinted windows a major +.<br /><br />If you did want to steal back from him, obviously you can&#039;t do it so your best option is to get a trustworthy friend he doesn&#039;t know to start doing small deals with him, have him eventually do the same thing of offering to sell him weight, except this time expect him and his friends to be waiting for you and come in packing, zip tie and ball gag the little punks and beat the fucking shit out of them as you ransack the house. If it were me I&#039;d probably bring gas or lighter fluid and light the little hog tied pussies up, but that&#039;s just me.<br /><br />Can&#039;t believe so many people say not to do anything over a small amount. I don&#039;t care what amount, if someone stole the button off my shirt I&#039;d curb the bitch, it&#039;s the principle. About 8 or 9 years ago when I was messing with regs a girl came in my apartment to get a zip and while I was weighing it out she grabbed the qp and took off out the door where her boyfriend was waiting for her and they took off. Took me 2 years to catch up with her but she ended up buying from a friend of mine who let me know and her next pickup I was waiting in his house with him, if she was a guy she would have gotten it bad but she got off easier and took what money she had and several hundred xannys and some xtc from her car, so in the end it took me 2 years but I ended up with doubling my money lost at least.

				Given that you bumped into this a-hole in the mall (and you already knew him, and both do drugs) it sounds feasible you&#039;ll bump into him again. With that in mind, and the fact he seems to have loyal friends, I&#039;d let it rest for a while. Do you want to be strolling the mall with your Mom/Kids/New flame and have this dick start on you?<br /><br />Honestly, if he&#039;s this much of a douche someone else will pop him eventually, you won&#039;t need to get your hands dirty.<br /><br />If you *really* want to retaliate, I&#039;d either wait a good few months or opt for something damaging but non-violent (I reckon you&#039;re probably more intelligent than him [he doesn&#039;t exactly sound, er, gifted] so use your brain and not your brawn,..it&#039;ll be longer before he realizes he&#039;s fucked, and he may be too stupid to ever figure out how).<br /><br />Without knowing more about him, his set up, and his general lifestyle it&#039;s difficult to make suggestions in this regard.<br /><br />And stick to SR...I always want top notch cannabis :)

				I don&#039;t know, extreme violence, torture, murder or life-long scarification seems a bit extreme for what amounts to a mugging. I&#039;d reserve that kinda shit for vengeance on someone that hurt me or my family. He stole from you, you steal back. Unless you&#039;re some kind of irl knigpin that needs to instil fear and send a message to continue to operate, I&#039;d just go for what I&#039;m owed plus a little &quot;fuck you&quot; charge on top.<br /><br />Personally, I&#039;d get three or four dudes with you. You and all but one set-up on the back door late at night with some beat-down weapons. One guys sets up a distraction out front depending on how secluded the place is. Car fires&#039; nice if a neighbor wont have the cops there in 2 minutes. Otherwise a loud ruckus, smash some headlights, brick through a front window. Once everyone&#039;s out front from inside, crew goes in the back. Distraction guy bails after signaling somehow the number of people that come out. Too many to handle, bail and try another time. Just him and maybe one or two buddies, you wait for em to come back in. They&#039;re not expecting a crew to jump them as they come back in, so that&#039;s what you do. <br /><br />Get &#039;em down and scared and secured, one guy with a mean looking shotty can keep the peace pretty well.&nbsp; Then get the money, drugs, valuables and anything you feel like from the whole house. Maybe bust up some shit that&#039;s a bitch to replace. Appliances and shit like that. Smash the fixtures off the wall in the shower or tub, the kitchen sink, ceiling lights, stuff they gotta call a guy to replace. Best thing is if it&#039;s a rental and they got to explain to some pissed off slumlord why they got to remodel the fucking house. You may not get compensated what your shit was worth, but you&#039;re gonna cost them a lot more than they got for it. Then your distraction guy wheels up in the van, load up the shit and the boys and tip on out. Those fuckers are busy trying to figure out how to shut off the goddamn water and/or put out a car fire in the middle of the night and so fucking overwhelmed by everything they might even forget to call it in.<br /><br />Obviously, you don&#039;t want to do this right away when there&#039;s only one possible guy that pissed at them. Move or shut-down your op, clean your house. Make sure you can breeze through a visit from the pigs. Do it disguised and leave no evidence, cops can&#039;t charge you just because he says it&#039;s you.&nbsp; Hell wait till your lease is up and move to a new fucking place if possible. 6 or 9 or 12 months, whatever it takes. Let&#039;s the thieves relax a little too, get comfortable thinking they fucked you over and pulled it off. Serve that shit cold. <br /><br />Whatever you do, don&#039;t call the fucking cops. Kinda fucked up seeing people jumping there in a place like this. Golden fucking rule is no cops, ever. But you gotta do something, otherwise this dude or one of the guys with him is gonna target you, you&#039;ll be an easy mark til you show them otherwise. While I can&#039;t agree with ultra-violent retribution for theft, I would definitely be causing some expensive damage to these fuckers. Just gotta make sure it&#039;s thorough enough they don&#039;t even consider paying it back on you.<br /><br />Also dude, I&#039;m sorry but this... <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=21679.msg222221#msg222221">Quote from: TheBigDirty on May 04, 2012, 03:39 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />They kicked me right in the ass on my way out and i fell down the front steps and my shoes came off.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Had me laughing pretty hard.

				Paying someone to help you wont work, you don&#039;t got those connects. I think most here have been in your shoes at some point, you gotta be patient and meet the right people. Call the product a loss and learn from it.. don&#039;t be impatient.. if you have it you may sit on it for a year but eventually it&#039;ll sell.<br /><br />To call the cops would be grimey and bad for future business. To try to hire somebody, or enlist somebody to help solve YOUR fuck ups is in itself another fuck up... You don&#039;t wanna go there.<br /><br />If I were you I&#039;d go buy a gun and a bottle of xanax bars after your next few harvests, and try not to offer your product or push it on anyone irl... keep your mouth shut and your ears open, and be patient.<br />

				keiki is right, it simply does not make any sense. I have been around for some time, I&#039;m not going to get all &#039;you are but a humble grasshopper&#039; on you, but you certainly don&#039;t need a wizened, white bearded character from a Shaolin temple to know that controlling yourself is the No.1 key to success in business and life in general. <br /><br />99% of the time, it is your fault when you have problems. That is a fact.<br /><br />Maybe you don&#039;t like to hear this, but it is you who screwed up a business decision by trusting somebody untrustworthy and that is the exclusive reason why you&#039;re in this situation. You feel humiliated, unfairly treated and I would totally fucking concur that those guys were complete assholes who royally deserve retaliation.<br /><br />That however is not the point. Because of the implications for you in the future, things have a way of getting very complicated in these kinds of situations. What matters is your ROI, your return on your investments. You can&#039;t work if you&#039;re in prison or a box for young offenders. The penalty for having violence on a criminal record is huge. You are now ten times more likely to get &#039;picked up&#039; by the police in the future. You are way more likely to get caught out by junk that the average citizen does not. You will not be allowed to enter certain countries for example if you have a criminal record, particularly if it is violence related.<br /><br />Violence is a last resort. Believe me, coming from pine that is quite something, I mean don&#039;t be beguiled by the attractive avatar. It is like a character from a TV show once said in the Simpsons. You do all the small things right, cross you t&#039;s and dot your o&#039;s, and it gives you the ability to get away with huge things on a whole bunch of levels.<br /><br />If you crossed pine, you&#039;d have scheduled yourself onto the missing person&#039;s list of people never ever found again.<br /><br />But I never really need to do that because of the way I have always done business. If you need a &#039;reputation&#039; to do business on the streets, you get short term relief in the form of a temporary moat of fear until the next guy with a bigger club comes along. But guess what. The police know you too now. That means you&#039;ve lost the game already before it&#039;s even begun. If you think that&#039;s impractical for you, well hey, you&#039;re unimaginative, congratulations.<br /><br />You know who are really fucking successful gangs on the streets of America&#039;s cities? Nigerians. They have a cultural distaste for murdering people, and they are at the bottom of every government department&#039;s list of people to bang up because of it. Most people are not even aware that they are possibly the most connected and powerful drug trafficking group in America. They make serious profits, they don&#039;t make headlines apart from the 411 scams which are almost treated humorously by the press and have been around for decades. That is smart. And a complete contrast to the typical African American gang who appear to have a revolving door policy since they are guests of the state so often. I mean, is this a job or a vocation, fuck!<br /><br />tldr; be smart.

				If the OP has a connection with a solid enforcer type who will take dope for the deed, and can keep the enforcer type from knowing where his homespot and grow-op are.. giving up some bulk for the enforcers services is very solid thinking.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t have those sorts of connections and you intend to deal IRL you need to start MAKING those connections. I suggest you start collecting a circle of heavy friends who like to help &quot;sample&quot; your crops. Just don&#039;t let them know where your growop is. Hell don&#039;t let ANYONE know THAT.

				If he doesn&#039;t know where you live or could possibly know anyone who might know where you live then good, personally, whenever I do IRL deals at times it&#039;s only to good friends of mine and even so, no one knows my address because I just don&#039;t like sharing it, never know what could happen. I say to retaliate against that fucker, hate people like him. You&#039;re at a pretty good start if you did find out that he works at the mall part time, but, if you plan on burning his car with the gasoline take into the account of other people who might get hurt or their car damaged as it could fuck up their lives. Scope out the area for any cameras and see the traffic of people around the parking lot on days and plan it when there is the least amount of people there. A suggestion would be to slash all the tires, possibly forcing him to leave the car there over night until he can fix it himself and take care of it during the night, that is, if he doesn&#039;t call a tow truck service to get the car, and wear a mask of course. Murder is completely out of the option, once that action is done LE would be all over the place, but for a simple beat down or slashing it won&#039;t be as serious. Did you tell him that you grow by any chance?
