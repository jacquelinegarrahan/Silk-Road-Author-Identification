				In the human body and brain there exists thousands of microscopic receptors. These receptors are like encoded locks that need specific keys in the form of various molecular structures to activate them, setting processes in motion that result in everything from the sense of smell to experiencing that which lies beyond the confines of the (presently) finite human brain.<br /><br />There are cannabanoid receptors, opiate receptors, so-called &#039;hallucinogenic&#039; receptors, nicotine receptors, amphetamine receptors and so on. These receptors are part of what makes us human. The keys to many of these receptors are found - and only found in substances such as cannabis, opiates, tobacco, psilocybin, amphetamines, etc. Dimethyltriptamine (DMT) is excreted by the pineal gland at birth and death and bonds with it&#039;s receptor within the human brain.<br /><br />Marijuana, &#039;magic mushrooms&#039;, opium poppies, salvia, ergot fungi, peyote, coca leaf etc contain these encoded keys that are specific to each receptor. When a person imbibes these substances they are unlocking parts of the human brain-mind that would normally lie dormant, unused and essentially wasted.<br /><br />You will find all of these physiological keys in nature, more specifically in the plants and fungi mentioned above.<br /><br />However the powers that be believe these miracles of nature are evil and label them &quot;narcotics&quot; or &quot;drugs&quot; and even worse - they make the grave mistake of playing God by deciding what an individual can and cannot put inside their body. They make laws prohibiting these so-called drugs because their minds have been conditioned by society, ever since they were born - just like the rest of us. Except the only difference is - we dared to think for ourselves and decided to drop the conditioning about how all drugs (except doctor prescribed ones, tobacco and alcohol) are evil and a danger to society.<br /><br />The fall or destruction of society will not come from people taking drugs. If not climate change, it will most likely come from those very people (governments, law enforcement, etc) who prohibit the use of&nbsp; &#039;drugs&#039; - especially substances like cannabis, stimulants, euphoriants and psychedelics - by engaging in physical and psychological violence&nbsp; against so-called &#039;drug&#039; sellers and users in killing the rights of human beings to be master of their own bodies and minds. <br /><br />Governments - democratic or otherwise - with their law enforcement departments are in actuality, for the most part - just a bunch of human beings that have formed organisations from their ambition and love of power and money whereby they can exert power over people to the extent that they believe they can put a fellow human being in jail because that human being smoked or swallowed something that came directly from nature. Even a substance that is produced within the human body like DMT is in their eyes &#039;illegal&#039; if&nbsp; any human being were to take that substance - also found in numerous plant species. Does that make any sense?<br /><br />I believe that the type of people who like to rule and make laws for other human beings, do so out of their conservative, psychologically imprisoned and conditioned thinking, which has created ignorance and fear within them. That is why this world is in such a mess. It is governed by those who are ignorant of life&#039;s infinite wonder and whose minds have sadly been conditioned by tradition, fear and ignorance!<br /><br />Simulacra

				The evolution of plants that produce drugs is very interesting. I think a more realistic interpretation is that during the course of our coevolution these plants have hijacked certain features of our nervous system. We have selected opium poppies to yield more opium, and they have selected us to enjoy and find useful their products. ( I can certasinly conceive of&nbsp; a selective advantage to resisting pain and fatigue).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Probably the original plant evolved the narcotic poison as a way of spreading its seeds; ideally it &#039;wants&#039; an animal to eat it and excrete the seeds, but not eat so much as to destroy the plant. What better way than to produce a soporific chemical. Later once humans began to use the poppy artificial selection took over. I believe now, like wheat, the opium poppy asctually needs humans to sow its seeds.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Likewise, among the people who use the poppy, there would be an advantage to those who could metabolise the opioids without side effects( I admit this is pushing it a bit)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t think though that the fact our brains have receptors that are activated by certain drugs means that we &quot;are meant to&quot; use them. Our nervous system is burdened with many artefacts of our long evolutionary history, not all of them helpful to modern man.

When you eat magic mushrooms the human body breaks down psilocybin into psilocin. Psilocin bonds to, and activates several of the serotonergic receptors. When it bonds to the 5-HT2a receptor it mimics the effects of serotonin. Psilocin is also known to bond to the 5-HT1a, 5-HT1d and 5-HT2c receptors as well. This is why it effects mood, motivation, and the bonding to receptors in the cerebral cortex are the reason for the changes in thought and perception.<br /><br />Looking at psilocin at a chemical level the difference between it and serotonin is very small. Serotonin has two hydrogen atoms attached to one of the nitrogen atoms that psilocin does not.<br /><br />

				Le, Le, Le... your problem is that of all our problem. The ego. <br /><br />It is the underlying factor of your fear based occupation and fearful experience such that you feel so separate and disconnected that you have no other seen option than to exert force and/or authority upon others, thereby reinforcing your illusion of separateness.&nbsp; But you are not separate!<br /><br />It&#039;s called indoctrination. We all have it, being raised on the collective ego of the species. All our pain, all our dysfunction. It all stems from not remembering who you truly are. Which brings forth a perfect opportunity for transformation, growth. You are just like me, perhaps &quot;less open&quot;. <br /><br />I urge you fellow human: open your heart. Search your soul. Not your mind/ego which will always take you away from the present moment and keep you feeling separate and in fear.... and RIGHT! You must know you&#039;re right, right? You must have all the justifications in the world. I have a strong feeling that your path causes much more detriment to others in the name of justice than the whole lot of SR does to it&#039;s plethora of SATISFIED WILLING PARTICIPANTS. <br /><br />Right and wrong is only that which consensus agrees upon. Because in this case le... you&#039;re wrong. But I think neither side is wrong. <br /><br />Are we listening? LE is the perfect display of fear in action. You fear that which you do not understand. What you fear you give strength to and energy to. When I think most people here just wanna give you a nice, from a distance, E-hug. At least we all know here that your entire career is a facade. You cannot stop the raising of awareness with or without drugs. It&#039;s part of our path as a species. As humans. Your contribution to oppression will hurt the day you awaken. You cannot continue to convince others MDMA is dangerous and carries no therapeutic, heart opening, trauma releasing properties. I&#039;ll let you in on a little secret: it does!!!<br /><br />I highly recommend you ingest 125mg of mdma next chance you get :) you might learn a bit about what it really means to be part of the human species. <br /><br />Le.... I know you were hurt when you were younger. I know this. It&#039;s okay. I Still love you anyway. You are special, wonderful, magnificent human being, however misguided. <br /><br />Exerting authority over another, hence power is a very primitive fear based human act. I have faith you can come up with a more honoring demonstration of your being. Search your soul within! You can do it! <br />

Regarding Nicotine receptors, I&#039;m afraid your the one giving misinformation. Nicotinic receptors are a fact, belonging to the acetyl-choline family.&nbsp; As for DMT being excreted by the pineal gland at death and/or birth - you are right, it is only hypothesis at present, but at least Strassman&#039;s research has proven that all the enzymatic material needed to produce DMT is found in the pineal gland of mammals.

Fear can only exist in relation to something else - usually something that is not familiar or totally unknown (as in racism, etc). To those of Law Enforcement - in this instance -&nbsp; drugs are the unknown. Their conditioning has them thinking that all drugs are the same, ie. evil, a scourge on society, so their ego is fed by this need to rid the world of drugs. They forget or self-police any thoughts that Nature is creating these so-called drugs every second, eg. cannabis, psychedelic mushrooms and many plant species.&nbsp; Humans harvest these substances - some of which need no interference and others that need processing for&nbsp; easier human consumption.<br /><br />Many lethal substances are legal and readily commercially available, but nobody is drinking rat poison or acetone because people - adults in particular, not five-year olds - have the ability to use logic and reason.&nbsp; In banning so-called &#039;drugs&#039; especially those that are manufactured entirely by nature, the groups of human beings who call themselves governments, voted in by their conditioned, indoctrinated masses, are robbing humanity of their individual autonomy and freedom to partake in the wonders of nature. In the future this will become a crime against humanity, ie. deprivation of an individual&#039;s basic human rights.<br /><br />Simulacra

(I am in the USA)<br /><br />My position was that drug users were just everyday people, they hold jobs, have families, and are just like everyone else. His was what I would call the stereotypical view held by most police. <br /><br />At one point in the conversation he commented, as if to reenforce his position &quot;Drug users are lazy stupid criminals who will rob and steal from you, they can not be trusted&quot;<br /><br />I smiled and replied &quot;You know, back in the 1940&#039;s and 50&#039;s it was said that Niggers are lazy stupid criminals who will rob and steal from you, they can not be trusted. Strange how one stereotype can be applied to two different groups of people who society chooses to ostracize. Was this stereotype true about black men or just propaganda and if it was just propaganda then, what makes you think it is not propaganda now that it is applied to a different group?&quot;<br /><br />He sat for a moment with a look on his face that told me this had never even crossed his mind. He looked at his watch and said he had to get home to his wife. He paid his bill and left in a bit of a hurry. I do wish he would stop back by the bar as I would love to continue the conversation with him&nbsp; ;)

				Nice one.&nbsp; +1<br /><br />I had the same conversation with a black off duty cop this summer. His ideals weren&#039;t biased though. He said, &quot;to each their own. As long as they&#039;re not doing dumb ass shit, I&#039;m ok with it.&quot; We then continued drinking at several different bars.<br /><br />This guy was former military and had a better understanding than the retard pigs that are generally bullies.

				An interesting post OP.<br /><br />I think opiates are an interesting double of the current &#039;war on drugs&#039;. Demonised by many (even within drug societies) yet there use within the medial fields is widespread and maybe even fundamental for the pain management industry. The same chemicals that the anti-drug propaganda claim would ruin your life if tried even once, are used daily in hospitals, and each one of us are likely to have administered at least once during our lifetimes. People who live with chronic pain are administered such drugs on a long term basis and will likely become addicted. But their addictions are managed in a supportive way so that they can continue to actively contribute to society. <br /><br />It is a widespread misconception that the negative health issues of your average street junkie are caused by the opiates they take. If that were the case old uncle bob with his cancerous prostate would be in the same state. It&#039;s the other things added to their opiates, it&#039;s the unsafe practices they use administering the drugs and finally (and maybe most importantly) it&#039;s the poverty caused by their drug habits which at the least result in a poor diet, and at the worst lead to homelessness.

If they did, they&#039;d know they were wrong. They see us as something less, something to be spit on and kicked and locked away, because they are conditioned by their environment to believe that.<br /><br />*points to signature* There is no objective reality. I don&#039;t see how that could be more clear than when realizing that different people have different definitions of human, different criteria for deserving of freedom, of civil liberty and rights, based on beliefs learned in childhood.<br /><br />Sure, stop the rapists and pillagers, but not by raping and pillaging.

The whole game here is for us to know thyself EXPERIENTIALLY. God only knows godself conceptually except through YOU! Oops. I think I let the cat out. If you haven&#039;t figured out yet... you. Are...... need I say it? Ill break it to u a little easier. You are.... that which is. You have always been and always will be. We are all one and the same. Its only in creation and EXPERIENCE that we can define who we are. <br /><br />If you know who you are, as in, you know yourself to be a part of the whole... inherently part of the divine, then you can re-member you are here to create. And what path of righteousness exists without re-membering? Without forgetting first? Le&#039;s are simply the opposite of love in action. Fearers. They are the ego in form. We all are of course... we all have an ego with which to use as a tool... so we can NOT use it! <br /><br />Why do people hurt others n persecute others still? Its all the game we came to participate in so that we might re-create ourselves anew in each new moment of now. We cannot, simply cannot have a sunny perfect cloudless day again and again and again. It ceases to hold meaning. Its why heaven (the concept of heaven) does not make any sense. Heaven is the moment u know yourself as connected and communing with divinity.<br /><br />Do you all believe that &quot;form&quot; is all there is? What is manifested? What about where what is manifested comes from? Oh fuck. I&#039;ve done it. I think I&#039;ve blown it haha!<br /><br />Get this.... consciousness is spreading. More and more are refusing to support those who exert power over others. We are all magnificent beings<br />made up of the same stuff. Its why lez are on their way out... a dying breed. You may scoff le.. but believe it. You are a dying breed. Only fueled by a failing system that rewards power, competition and greed. Very much a poor example of the species. <br /><br />I love all y&#039;all fucks. Even those who try n cage me up. My last encounter w cops I was thanking them for doing their jobs. They believe they are good people. Just indoctrinated as fuck. Like we all are.<br /><br />And limit: if you seek personal growth you&#039;ll do fine. Philisophically is one thing. But spiritually speaking... life is all spiritual. All problems economic, social, political etc... are all spiritual. And by spiritual I mean a connection to life. So, thanks for playing this game :) I too LOVE the social application of the road. Its fucking beautiful. You&#039;ll get there for sure. As long as u give a fuck about life. <br /><br />I have some serious shit going on with law (not tooo serious) but enough to rattle my bones... and when I prevail... I&#039;m gonna teach all you fucks the real game. There is a way out of societal control, I promise! It comes down to education. The unconventional kind. <br /><br />You&#039;ve been givin notice. <br /><br />The reason I dig my expression here is because I know EVERYTHING WE DO has an effect on life. You are every bit as much significant as you think you are not. <br /><br />Sorry for the rant... benzos n alchohol. Weeee! <br /><br />And how many u les are actually hypocrytical drug users? U know u are, you ain&#039;t got ta lie craig! What would you do w/o caffeine??? Good luck being pawns of fear. There&#039;s still good in you I know it.
