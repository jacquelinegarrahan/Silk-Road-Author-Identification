				Hı All<br /><br />Basically, cut to the chase.... im ın Northern Cyprus (the Turkısh side) and im sweatıng buckets and i mean buckets as its currently 35 - 40degrees and countıng and due to my horrendous buckets of sweat pourıng from my body methadone is not holdıng me very well therefore and İm having mild withdrawals which are not so pleasant.. im tryıng to find someone who may be able to sell me some brown, heroın, smack, skagg...call ıt what you will. Being a major trafficking route İ thought perhaps some makes its way off the boat and into the harbor and main town called Girne.<br /><br />Can anyone point me in the right direction or at least give me some hints or advice as to where to look or ask? İm not stupid İ dont expect anyone from SR to meet me and im defınıtely not a fuckıng copper İm just a dumb whıte boy ın northern cyprus whose cluckıng lıke a chıcken has got 12 days holiday left and really fancies a smoke. İ dont want to start asking every Tom Dick &amp; Harry as last time İ did that in Turkey when İ was 16 yrs old İ ended up asking an off duty police man if he knew where to get any weed and although he laughed and was fucking cool about the entire episode he could quite easily have been a total dick and slapped cuffs on me or bribed me.&nbsp; One thought was racing through my head as İ praid to him literally on my knees....&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;Midnight Express&#039; if you haven&#039;t seen that film then you should and you&#039;ll know what İ mean.<br /><br />Any serious comments appreciated and İ will even cross the palm of the person who sets me up (wishful thinking) with btc´s.<br /><br />Thanks guys n gals and sorry to ask İ really am but desperate times means desperate measures.<br /><br />Cheers - Jimmy :-[ :-\ :&#039;( :o :-X ;)<br /><br />

So close to the source yet so far away!!<br /><br />Cheers Jimmy

				Go to the Salparo Hotel. Ask the concierge if he has seen Jenny Talya. His response is your secret pass phrase. Then walk over to Fig Tree Beach beyond the hotel. Once on the beach, locate a hairy beast of a man in an extra tight speedo and repeat the pass phrase 3 times to the man then reach into his speedo and place your money for any amount you like. He&#039;ll then provide you with your smack.<br /><br />No one is (or shouldn&#039;t be) willing to give up their anonymity to provide f2f sales. Your best bet would be to order off SR, asking on here is a long shot but I&#039;m sure you already know that.

				Hi guys thanks for the replies....oh yes I knew it was possibly the longest punt of a long shot İve ever taken but worth a try.<br /><br />Meister, took your advıce and the hairy guy in Speedos took my money and my mısses and she&#039;s now working as an unpaid prostitute for a Saudi prince on a big yacht. İ think she&#039;s happy, they feed her. On a more serious note, İ wasn&#039;t expecting a F2F from anyone on SR and never would, dıd say that ın my initial message. Was just hoping for a nudge in the right direction being on unfamiliar territory n all that! İve pm&#039;d one of my regular vendors for delivery times to my location. Not sure İ&#039;ll get ıt here in tıme but we wıll see, cheers.<br /><br />Thanks also TT - really helpful but İ think İ need to forget this idea, saying that, frustratingly when İ was here last year&nbsp; someone told me about a drug house&nbsp; but I think its been shut down now.<br /><br />Thanks anyway.

I used to travel quite often and the 2 easiest ways I found for quick hookups were to ask hotel concierge, baggage handlers or valets at hotels, or taxi drivers if you manage to find one you can understand. I know it sounds shady, but these are people who make most of their income by tips from you not their measly hourly salary from their employers they usually hate.<br /><br />Going up to a valet to see if he wants to puff on a joint with you puts you both more at ease, just try to buy a very small amount to both limit how much you could potentially lose if he tries to rip you off, and so it doesn&#039;t look so suspicious to him.<br /><br />Escorts are another one but they&#039;re often shady and the drug dealers they would refer you to would be even shadier. I&#039;ve never been to Turkey so I can&#039;t give the best specific advise, but in Kuwait it was as easy as asking our taxi driver, via digital English to Arabic translator, to take us to an opium house.

				See!! you do have good ideas! I&#039;d already thought about the taxı drivers option but not the valet and not asked ın taxi yet as every time İm ın a cab my girlfriend is there also and although she only tolerates and indulges in the more &#039;socially acceptable&#039; drugs such as coke, MDMA and weed she has a big frown on the brown, as do İ when İ smoke it!&nbsp; My regular vendor on SR has failed to respond so far and as it goes has recently changed his shipping locations to EU ONLY so that rules out northern Cyprus and the only other guy who may get it here in time is in İtaly and has also not responded.<br /><br />Apparently there is a purge here at the moment on all drugs as was seen as easy target for trafficking and general drug use was getting out of hand, so says a local English woman who strongly advısed me against even asking for weed....but she would say that.<br /><br />Really appreciate your time to reply, if I don&#039;t get myself banged up abroad ın a sweaty Turkish cell İ&#039;ll let you know if I get lucky......scoring.....drugs.<br /><br />

				Hi<br /><br />First, Midnight Express is full of shit<br /><br />Second, you are not close to the source<br /><br />H is not easy to find in Turkey unless you know people or have a pair of titanium balls<br /><br />You can find whatever you are looking for in Istanbul but keep in mind that H is different than weed and the places you need to be in to get it are extremely dangerous, its quite possible that dealers will understand that you are a foreigner and maybe rob you instead of selling you anything<br /><br />H game in Turkey is not nice<br /><br />I am Turkish, and I know the market pretty well however since I am not into H at all I cannot forward anything or anyone to you<br /><br />You wont be able to score anything until the rest of your holiday<br /><br />IF you really wanna find something and decide to change your holiday a bit, you can find people in Tarlabasi who can help you out. Remember though, the dealers there are worthless people and have nothing to lose so you cant really guess what they will do<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />Also,<br />TallTemptress are you Turkish? Where have you lived before?<br /><br />I wanna speak with Turks from the onion network, I am mainly a lurker without an account<br />After seeing this thread I decided to open one

				Have you ordered anything from SR?<br /><br />The customs here are fucked up, and you know that you also get buttraped when the emniyet catches you<br /><br />I got friends who sent weed to their homes from Amsterdam before, but that was years ago

				QUICKO - Your hıjackiing my thread man but fuck it I may as well throw the towel in as İ think you&#039;re rıght....however saying that I&#039;m the kınd of ıdıot who doesn&#039;t gıve up easy until I&#039;m ın a tıght situation!....so to speak. So far İve been given a number by a guy who reckons he can sort me weed out no problems and it was there İ was looking to ask for the nasty!<br /><br />When İ say close to the source, I meant Northern Cyprus ıs a shipping/trafficking route from Turkey or maınly Afghanıstan and considered an easy or soft target or at least it used to be. Just figured some of that stuff must make its way off the boats and inland but hey your the Turk so you know more than I.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks - Jimmy<br /><br /><br />
