				I don&#039;t care for black hats... but I can&#039;t say Ballz&#039; suggestion is a bad one or anything.&nbsp; But what are you doing looking for this on the darknet?&nbsp; This is big business these days.&nbsp; Facebook, Google, Yahoo, any convenience store with one of those stupid savings cards -- this is what they do.&nbsp; They profile customers for targeted ads.&nbsp; It raises the click-through rate by a substantial number, so it&#039;s worth paying for.<br /><br />There&#039;s gotta be somebody you can buy this info from legally and without the damn hassle of people trying to scam you for your bitcoins?

				i asked on here because some people are pretty knowledgeable with computers it seemed to me. it seems everyone knows someone on here. I dont know much about hackbb or whatever it was called. I will look into it. Nothing any store sells is related so to speak to my business. Im looking for customers who are already using the service I offer that are not happy with the care they are receiving or the cost of a program they are working on. <br /><br />Thanks

				Black hats are the hackers that are out to steal, cheat, and otherwise take whatever&#039;s valuable from anyone they come across.&nbsp; White hats are the guys who just like security and find the whole bit fascinating and like to play with computers, but they don&#039;t hurt people with their knowledge.<br /><br />Black hats are out to deliberately hurt people.&nbsp; Which is why I say I don&#039;t care for them.&nbsp; Hell, half of them don&#039;t even know what they&#039;re doing... they just use someone elses program to get the job done.&nbsp; But that really doesn&#039;t matter -- since it usually does get the job done, and all.

				If you&#039;re in the UK I could provide you with over 3.000.000 personal details of people. Details such as address and phone number.
