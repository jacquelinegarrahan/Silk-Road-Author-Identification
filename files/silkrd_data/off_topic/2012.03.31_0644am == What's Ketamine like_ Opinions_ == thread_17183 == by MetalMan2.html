				I love it. Some people hate it. Its really hard to explain what its like though. Nitrous Oxide is kinda close. You really just have to experience it for yourself to find out if its for you. I like to take a couple of valium while sniffing K. It really adds to the hypnotic effect. 2 minutes feels like 2 hours.

				I used to do it when i was in high school in grade 11.<br />I love it , honestly from my experiences low doses feel anything from<br />Being really drunk (feeling like you drank a whole 2-six of vodka), without feeling dizzy or sick. A cool aspect of doing ketamine is that its a dissociative meaning you will be feeling numb as well :), (Ketamine was used in human beings for surgery and painful procedures before doctors decided they didnt like patients feeling a buzz :P)<br />the more you do the more psychedelic the effects become, thus making the drug very interesting. I have spent many weeks and nights enjoying ketamine along side with MDMA or Ecstasy. I personally love Ketamine alone or as a top off in a joint or with some x. I will not forget when i was in a ketamine binge i recall nights of snorting whole viles to my face ( im fairly skinny and small) and remember K holing, its an experience i cannot really put into words because i sure was a young pup but i remember not knowing what was going on untill after i snapped out of my khole, but it sure was mind blowing.&nbsp; but honestly between us SilkRoadians... i love Ketamine way better than cocaine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ketamine is a +1...<br />just make sure you get something decent.<br />So from PsiloCybin<br />1up!

				Ketamine is like transforming into Jesus Christ Superman and flying through hyper-mega-space in fifteen dimensions on an urgent mission from God to fight some mysterious evil force that you can&#039;t quite identify, but then the 6th dimension bends over on itself and you break through the multiverse into a new meta-dimension where you are on a space ship that is flying at near light speed through vast empty space and then you wake up on the floor of your bathroom drooling on yourself in the fetal position and feel like somebody shot you in the gut

You&#039;re confusing dissociative with anesthetic. Dissociative means you&#039;ll feel disconnected from your body and perhaps your own mind and thoughts (derealization and depersonalization, respectively).

				There are no words powerful enough to describe the earth shattering god fisting that you will receive from Ketamine.<br /><br />No drug has even come within a 100th of the amazingness that Ketamine brings. Heroin, LSD, Meth, DMT are not even worth discussing when thinking of things to compare this drug too. The sober human mind can&#039;t comprehend anything so awesome. It literally cannot be described. Any description no matter how amazing will pale in comparison to the experience of a deep khole.<br />

				I think ketamine models psychosis better than any other drug does, especially on epic binges. Last time I binged on it I was hearing voices / having delusions with auditory hallucinations playing into them and thinking far out shit like I was Jesus and all kinds of crazy shit, it really fit the exact description of psychosis. And was awesome :) but not something to do forever. <br /><br />It was actually not that bad, because even though I was hearing voices and hallucinating audio pretty heavily, I knew that it was not real in the back of my mind and could keep my shit together. Even though I thought I was the second coming of Jesus, I also knew that I wasn&#039;t. It was like my mind experienced vivid psychosis to the exact detail, every criteria, but like I was watching this psychosis from an isolated part of my brain that maintained sanity, almost like a split mind.

				If you want something very similar (it is in the same class as Ketemine) then try DXM (Dextromethorphine).&nbsp; DXM&nbsp; takes longer for onset and lasts longer,&nbsp; but the effects are strikingly similar (I am not saying that it is &quot;just Like&quot;).&nbsp; The best tasting preparation of DXM is Delsym (store brands like &quot;western family&quot; are cheaper and are the same thing).&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; Delsym and the like are DXM Polysitrix and most others are DXM Hydrobromide...just make sure that DXM is the only ingreadient...no tylonol or whatever.<br />Cheers,<br />Mezzrow

				DXM feels like a dirtier shittier version of ketamine. I have used a lot of DXM, but after trying ketamine I entirely switched over to it. IMO ketamine is a lot like DXM, but better in every single way. Given the choice between the two I would go with ketamine every single time.

				i think it is an amazing drug with right environment and dose. it feels like you are walking through jello and have a feeling of beautiful calm coursing through your body. its really hard to explain the k experience, but its a very safe drug(in moderate doses), and is worth a try.

				IMO, its good if you&#039;re about to go into surgery. I had a bad first experience with the shit, as an irresponsible child, didn&#039;t research dosage and railed a $20 line in one go. Learned my lesson too. The few times I did it since then were just because it was there to be done, one time was mildly fun but that&#039;s not a great reason I would say in retrospect.
