				Has anyone ever thought of the possibility that someone could become a trusted vender, send out plenty of good product and get lots of customers but then turn out just to be a sick serial killer? Okay so imagine he sends out like 10 clean orders a day. Randomly, out of nowhere he decides to poison each order from then on out with cyanide or something or other. Every customer <br />gets the product they were expecting, 5/5 review, product looks great, but then they take the product, get poisoned and die. No one knows their SR password, no one can let admins know. Someone could potentially poison hundreds of customers. It would be an unpunishable crime. No way the killer would ever get caught. How fucked up is that?<br /><br />Has anyone else ever thought of this? I want you to know i would NEVER do anything so sick. Im just a buyer who gets to thinking when im tweakin, and this is just somethin to come to mind. So let me know your thoughts on this, or any ideas of coming up with a way to prevent something like this from happening. :o<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />

				You want to get really scared?&nbsp; Some guy was talking about this in IRC one day.&nbsp; He &quot;couldn&#039;t understand why SR was so high and mighty morally,&quot; or something to that effect.&nbsp; Scary shit man.&nbsp; I almost warned the H crowd (he was talking about doing it to people who used needles).<br /><br />There was also a threat once upon a time about this that DPR received.&nbsp; That&#039;s apparently why they started charging for vendor accounts.&nbsp; Or so he said.&nbsp; The thing is... if you really want to do that, for God&#039;s sake, why not just go poison a fucking sprite in your local 7-11?&nbsp; Why you gotta come here and do that shit...

				I&#039;ve had exactly the same thoughts, yet I still order random powdery chems off here, and I&#039;m not dead yet. Look, if you die, tough shit, but use logic to minimize chances of that happening. <br /><br />Trusted dealers only, try to test your product via reagent or something beforehand, and first take a TINY dose of a new batch of X, before railing down a line.

				yes i tought about that. you get sick by touching cyanide so wiser option would be to use ricin. its peanuty taste if cut with heroin which is bitter it probably be undetectable and those who snort/ inject it would die in pain suffering for about 3-5 days since there&#039;s no antidote if dose is high enough.<br /><br />if someone wanted silkroad shutdown they&nbsp; would do just that. just think about news reports people dying from spiked drugs with poison received from anonymous marketplace silkroad.
