				Have a look at this video; it might put your mind at ease!<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDJrQBwJpqk<br /><br />Just read the bubbles of text that pop up during the video and you should relax about the thought of a Police confrontation. ;)

				You have next to no chance of getting off once they find it in your truck as they will charge you with possession which means that its in your possession, ownership dosen&#039;t really come into question.<br /><br />It is technically possible to beat a possession charge but realistically could you afford the type of lawyer that could do that?<br /><br />Kevin Smith talks on one of his DVDs about being stopped in a tour bus and getting caught with some weed that was his, but he forgot it was there, he was stopped on the Canadian border and rang his lawyer who rang another top lawyer who managed to get the actual bus charged with the offense and thus Kevin gets let off. Kevin is like.&quot;Damn this guy is good!!&quot;<br /><br />a) he is fairly rich.<br />b) he knows influential people.<br />c) he is pretty famous<br />d) people generally like Kevin Smith<br /><br />In your case they wouldn&#039;t even be looking for fingerprints, possession is possession is possession and its been found in your possession.<br /><br />
