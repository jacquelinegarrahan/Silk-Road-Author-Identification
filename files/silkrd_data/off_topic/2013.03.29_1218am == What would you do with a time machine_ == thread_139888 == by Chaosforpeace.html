				Who cares about having tons of money if you&#039;ve got a time machine? Sure, you would need various currency for your travels, but just imagine all of the things you could see, the wonders of the world laid out like the pages of a book to flip from one to the next day after day! Money would be the last thing on my mind.<br /><br /><br />If I only had one trip, that&#039;s a different story. My one trip is a very personal matter that I only shared with one person I know from a different place.

				My other thought would be go back in time and bang a girl in every decade. Just sound like a good time.<br /><br />Or go way back to the times of the ancient Egyptians and bring them dmt and all psychedelics. They would praise me as a god.

				In 2009, bitcoins were worth quite literally nothing. Mining was extremely easy. Only in september 2010, a bitcoin was worth about a dime.<br />If I just wanted to make money, I&#039;d just make a list of outcomes from sporting events and bankrupt the shit out of sports betting agencies.
