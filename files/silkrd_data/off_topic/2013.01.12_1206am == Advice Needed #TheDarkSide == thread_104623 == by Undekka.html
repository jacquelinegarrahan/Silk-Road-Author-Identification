				I don&#039;t know of how else to ask so I will have to provide a back-story to this is hopes that you can appreciate my situation. <br /><br />When I got out of high school I took a year off and moved away from my hometown (and best friend S) My life became all about my full time unskilled job, and drugs. This was a simpler time of invite-only forums (CHFC props if you get the reference) and shady email-deals. I went through a lengthy &#039;psychonaut&#039; phase and it ended badly. Like, I&#039;m ashamed at how low I sunk to to that to myself badly. I lived alone and had more money than I knew what to do with. I got to try virtually every compound there is to be taken recreationally. (seriously I can fill an 8 by 11 paper with compound names) Now I associate some warmth with then, thee were good times, bad times. But overall, objectively, I would have been better off without it, but live &amp; learn, eh. Flash forward to the present.<br /><br />I was the one who introduced SR to S, and now he is sitting on a pile of MDMA, TMA, and a host of other psych&#039;s.&nbsp; Now, I wont be doing any of those with him (because of what I associate the experience of being on those compounds with, they give me very bad vides) and I&#039;m his only &#039;drug friend&#039;. We are buddies, ya know, we chill and do ketamine, beer and weed, play video games and eat pizza every weekend. I have now way of even beginning to probe the matter with S, or so it seems. I fear a similar case is bound to happen, the same gradual sink into withdrawal from society, family, life... that happened to me. Perhaps I&#039;m just worried, my family did a good job of instilling a generalized sense of worry into me. But is it legit? Perhaps he&#039;s more resilient than me, but he is a serious ADHD case.<br /><br />I don&#039;t want to come off as this over protective pussy, because that&#039;s seriously out of character of me (I keep picturing House&#039;s friend Wilson). I dunno how to handle this, it feels like some cosmic cliche that has happened 1000 times before. There must be enough people out there willing to share any pertinent info such that this can at least somewhat gracefully..

				No matter what your feelings are about S, it comes down to the fact that unless S recognizes they actually have a problem and are ready to give up the gear, admit to themselves they indeed have a problem and are willing and committed to putting in the hard yards to rectify their issues, you won&#039;t achieve anything. &quot;You can lead a horse to water but you can&#039;t make it drink&quot; is the old saying.

				I have to agree with Wadozo here. No one could ever keep me from going all out with certain substances, I had to hit bottom as some people call it to really realize that it was indeed a problem. The question youre posing is certainly an important one though, I wouldnt say just give up on S, still be there for S in every way that you can. Man I lost so many people I love because of the shit I pulled but the ones who stuck it out with me were truly the best friends I could ever want.

				As thedopestjunkie points out, my post doesn&#039;t mean giving up on S. It was just to point out the fact that you can&#039;t help someone who won&#039;t help them self. By all means support and help them where you can, but until S hits that point of no return, they probably won&#039;t change or alter their behavior. As thedopestjunkie wrote, just because someone gets caught up in drugs doesn&#039;t necessarily make them a bad person. Those that are there to support you through the bad times will remain close to you for life. They are the ones who truly care and have your best interests at heart. They love you unconditionally.&nbsp; :)

				Not to be the overly optimistic smoke blower but it&#039;s time like this to remember that everyone has their own journey to take in life and sometimes that leads to cold, dark and lonely places but that&#039;s not always a bad thing. From my own life experience I know I&#039;ve gone down the wrong road MANY times but those mistakes led me to a point where I realized I needed to start thinking differently about life.<br /><br />So I guess the key is to love and inform but allow the person their travels. If he&#039;s a good guy, which it sounds like he is, you&#039;re voice will be one of many that reminds him that the real world is pretty awesome too. The fact that he seems inclined to take psychedelics makes me think he&#039;s actually just looking for that something more. Personally if I was adverse to MDMA but wanted to help my friend out I might offer to sit with him for a trip. It&#039;ll make communication amazingly easy and you might be able top open a dialog about where he is going and make sure he has some boundaries that will keep him safe.
