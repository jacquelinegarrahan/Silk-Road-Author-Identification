				I know that counterfeits are a delicate subject here so I won&#039;t share the URL (or is that ok?) but does anyone have any feedback on USJUD Counterfeits?<br /><br />I have been looking for a suppler for a while now and I have already got ripped off by &#039;cha0z&#039; so needless to say I don&#039;t want to send away alot of coin to someone I don&#039;t know anything about.<br /><br />His site looks very similar to WHMX Counterfeit who I believe are a scam, Could they be the same person just trying to re-brand himself?<br /><br />He also accepts clearnet escrow. Surely that can&#039;t be safe, using clearnet account to buy counterfeits!<br /><br />Anyway if anyone knows any thing about him let me know, Much Love!

				I&#039;ve been hoping to find a source for this as well. I just stumbled across Benzo Counterfeits through the Evil Wiki, they offer a sample 100bill for 75 including shipping...very curious, but won&#039;t pull the trigger unless I can find some corroboration that they&#039;re legit.
