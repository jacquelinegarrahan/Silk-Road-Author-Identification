				I don&#039;t know why I&#039;m telling you guys (all strangers here) about this but I have nobody else to share this with. I&#039;m planning a heroic acid trip. 4 tabs with 2 drops of 100ug each from Symbosis, 4 tabs from StreetPhramcy (at around 80-90ug each) and two tabs from JesusOfRave (ug unknown). I know that this is heroic and seems too much but honestly I really want this to happen and I really want to explore the unknown. I&#039;m really excited. I&#039;ve gone on countless trips with L and shrooms. I have some idea what to expect but at this point, no clue. <br /><br />squeeeeeeeeee. into the void we go! <br /><br />I&#039;m waiting for my regular vendor to re-up his stock of xanax so I can order some for emergencies/shit hitting the fan. I&#039;m gonna book a nice hotel room for two days with a nice view. pre-load my laptop with movies (Rango, Finding Nemo, pixar stuff). No music because I&#039;m profoundly deaf (I CAN hear music but it&#039;s way too complicated/a hassle to do). I have no idea what else to bring other than a shitload of water, I need to drink water whenever I&#039;m tripping (a compulsion)

				On that much acid you will need more than water, you will need sugar.<br /><br />Also i wouldnt waste an acid trip like that in a hotel room. But sometimes its better to stay safe somewhere where you have privacy and security...<br /><br />We had a student here down under from Brazil, he was frying from acid. Dont know the how&#039;s and why&#039;s, but he shoplifted something like a packet of biscuits,<br />when police were called it was described as an armed robbery. CCTV footage showed this guy being chased by a lot of police, when they caught him they tazed the shit out of him, he later died in hospital. He was in his 20&#039;s, and i was shocked after seeing it on tv. Fucking police tazed him while he was handcuffed.<br /><br />Get out there, drive so fucking far your stopping into places asking people where you are...when you have actually been there a thousand times!<br />Go on missions, hit the dessert, etc, but dont hit a hotel room, that would be the last place i would have that much acid. Too many ears around.<br /><br />But if your flying solo, then each to their own, just be careful.<br /><br /><br />

				I am flying solo.&nbsp; ;D plus I did trip in a hotel room, it was safe/secure for me. I can&#039;t trip at home anymore (too much questions and such)<br /><br />I live in the city, no way to hit the desert (I really wish this was possible but I&#039;ll make do with what I have). This hotel room will be stocked with a full fridge/two burners/microwave. I plan on shopping for comfort food like fruits/candy. I have considered driving long distance but I&#039;d be so exhausted after the trip, I wouldn&#039;t want to drive the same distance home. and besides, if I do run into problems, I can always call my mom to get me home. She doesn&#039;t ask questions if I&#039;m in dire distress. <br /><br />@ChemCat. You sound like my soulmate too. why not go all out for once. as the youngsters say &quot;YOLO!&quot;
