				Hello one and all;<br /><br />I am from the UK and after watching breaking bad i got myself some methamphetamine - for the last six months ive been occasionally dabbling with meth, smoking at the weekends<br />or on days off, and although i see why this drug is addictive, id would love to banish it&#039;s bad rep.<br /><br />Does anyone have any personal stories about thier use of meth that HASN&#039;T spiralled into a deep dark corner of the world at the expense of everything you ever loved and held dear?<br /><br /><br />

				Rexthered,<br /><br />Meth use always begins with MANY success stories. This is why people start using it more and more frequently. It feels like whenever they use meth, they experience positive outcomes. However, the way I describe it to people is that it&#039;s like gambling. Spend enough time at the casino, and the house ALWAYS wins. In other words, use meth on a long enough time frame and there is a pretty solid guarantee that it will spiral into a deep, dark corner of the world at the expense of everything you ever loved and held dear.<br /><br />The problem with meth?<br />It&#039;s too good. It&#039;s a drug that enables perfection when used in the right moments. And it&#039;s so damn easy, you know? So then more situations come up that seem to be great candidates for meth-enhancement. And you&#039;re just having success story after success story. The only true success stories that exist with meth are the ones where people used it one or two nights and then never did it again. Cuz they had two nights of success and didn&#039;t stick around long enough for shit to get bad. <br /><br />Hope that was helpful and not detracting from your thread :P

				I use amphetamine and methamphetamine because using my intellect without them is aggravating.&nbsp; It causes me great distress and irritation.&nbsp; When I&#039;m on meth, things are fascinating and stimulating.&nbsp; I can think clearly (unless I go overboard, of course).&nbsp; I can direct my thoughts where I want them to go; I realize things that I&#039;d otherwise overlook.&nbsp; The difference is really frighteningly dramatic, though part of that for me is withdrawal syndrome I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; But the point is that I love to learn and use what I learn when I&#039;m on amphetamines.&nbsp; I do not when I&#039;m off them.<br /><br />I don&#039;t care what name people like me are given, who believes we&#039;re not just whining, or what reputation is assigned to the molecule I use to feel like myself.&nbsp; It fucking works.&nbsp; It also seems to be a part of a lot of people destroying themselves.&nbsp; To be fair, I know of not a single person who&#039;s lost their life to meth: I&#039;m speaking only from popular opinion.<br /><br />I&#039;m inclined to think anyone like me who experiences such a profound difference between unmedicated and medicated life is mildly broken in at least one way... I know I am in a lot of them&nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp; Seriously though, meth has not ruined my life, and I&#039;m not homeless because of it.&nbsp; It does cause me a great deal of trouble though.&nbsp; And it&#039;s yet another thing that keeps me separated from the world.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard enough to find companionship in this world -- meth makes it much harder.&nbsp; Even among drug enthusiasts meth has quite a stigma attached to it.&nbsp; Though I suppose that&#039;s the entire idea behind your post, isn&#039;t it; remove the stigma.<br /><br />The benefits still outweigh the costs for me, but speaking objectively, it&#039;s not by all that much now.&nbsp; I&#039;d probably have no high school degree and be pumping gas if it weren&#039;t for amphetamines (methamphetamine included).&nbsp; Hell, I might not even be doing that -- I might be dead.&nbsp; Make no mistake though, I&#039;ve definitely become an addict and have all the problems that go along with that; still, if you want to call it a success story, I don&#039;t think you&#039;d be a liar.<br /><br />I post a whole lot around here and I don&#039;t exactly lie and say I&#039;m a happy person or anything, but not everything wrong with me is due to meth (in fact very little is due to meth).&nbsp; I hope nobody&#039;s gotten the wrong idea about that.

I could say it has always been there when I least expected it and when I most needed..I could say it adds days of long thought and productive work to my weeks...<br /><br />But, right now it has allowed me to stay off the Oxy&#039;s, benzo&#039;s, relaxor&#039;s, and weed, for nearly 30 days now. I kept the Mich Ultra mildly flowing though at 2-3 per night....Yep, straight.....I have no delusions of the fact that there will be a price to pay for this but lifting the cloud of almost 400mg a day of O for over 10 years had to stop, and the Bup&#039;s were far worse then the O&#039;s. Actually, the benzo&#039;s were the worst, for much longer than 10 yrs. They really still hurt but getting better.<br /><br />So again, I have had much of life&#039;s ups and downs over the years and know full well know this AIN&quot;T over yet.But I&#039;ve been able to get most of my affairs in order so when this debt comes due here shortly there won&#039;t be a big surprise.And yet I still see this as a success..Things can change in a blink though, and usually do for me...Stay positive and focused, well just focused.<br /><br />@SS you are def. no liar...<br /><br /><br /><br />
