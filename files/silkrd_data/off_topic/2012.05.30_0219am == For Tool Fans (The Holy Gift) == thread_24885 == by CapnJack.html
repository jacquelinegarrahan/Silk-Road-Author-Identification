				For all of you Tool fans out there who are not aware of this, you have to check it out (especially if you like tripping).&nbsp; I checked it out last weekend and was amazed at how well the songs fit together when reordered.&nbsp; Here is a file someone created for surround sound systems http://www.demonoid.ph/files/download/2863247/<br /><br />Explanation of the reordering of Lateralus:<br />Lateralus, actually needs to be reordered in order to reveal a secret message dealing with moving through consciousness as a movement of along spirals: &quot;Spiral out, keep going, spiral out&quot; sings Maynard James Keenan toward the end of &quot;Lateralus,&quot; the album&#039;s title track. Added to this is the tantalizing prospect that the album and its message are also influenced by the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. When plotted on a graph Fibonacci numbers form a spiral-like image. Moreover, the main riff in &quot;Lateralus&quot; is comprised of three different meters: 9/8, 8/8, 7/8, or: 987, which happens to be the sixteenth step in the Fibonacci sequence (as observed by Keenan himself during the writing of the song). Moreover, moreover (!), Keenan&#039;s halting vocal rhythms during the first verse of &quot;Lateralus&quot; correspond to Fibonacci numbers in their syllable counts:<br /><br />1 (Black)<br />1 (then)<br />2 (white are)<br />3 (all I see)<br />5 (in my infancy)<br />8 (red and yellow then came to be)<br />5 (reaching out to me)<br />3 (lets me see)<br /><br />Freaky, eh? Anyway, all this got one unknown fan to write up a big long post somewhere and to speculate that the actual order of the songs on Lateralus needed to be rearranged so as to reveal the &quot;true&quot; message of the album. Basically, the idea is this: Lateralus has 13 tracks (a Fibonacci number, BTW) so you place that track at the center of your new track order. The surrounding tracks are all grouped into pairs that sum the number 13 and spiraling in toward 13, then outward from it. Here&#039;s the suggested track arrangement with the two &quot;spirals&quot; in bold:<br /><br />6, 7, 5, 8, 4, 9, 13, 1, 12, 2, 11, 3, 10<br /><br />The unknown fan calls this arrangement The Holy Gift.<br /><br />A more long winded explanation:&nbsp; http://www.progarchives.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2694

				I&#039;ll have to give this a try, I&#039;ve only listened to songs off of Anema and 10,000 days and they never struck me as a band you would listen to during a trip at all
