				Shake and bake isn&#039;t worth the effort.&nbsp; It&#039;s very dirty with all yur chemicals trapped inside the crystal or paste you end up with.&nbsp; So it gets you high but also burns your stomache or lungs.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s ok for junkies who are going to die soon anyway.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />Meth is cheap here.&nbsp; $120 /g.&nbsp; Goes very far.&nbsp; Think about it ,&nbsp; the work and effort you will go through for small dirty batches ?&nbsp; It&#039;s hrs of work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t let me discourage you though.

				No kidding.&nbsp; Meth is harsh on the body.&nbsp; <br /><br />Selling dirty toxic meth to people is seriously bad.&nbsp; &nbsp;You know they will still use it anyway. Even if its killing&nbsp; them it&#039;s pure evil.&nbsp;

				LOL... Good lord people...<br /><br />1. Brown urine is a sign of dehydration (and is bad for your kidneys).&nbsp; No urine is a sign of renal (kidney) failure; if you&#039;re still urinating, even if it&#039;s brown, your kidneys probably aren&#039;t failing or anywhere near it.<br />2. Anyone who knows what they&#039;re doing can get shake&#039;n bake meth as clean as any other meth.&nbsp; But if they knew what they were doing, they probably wouldn&#039;t be trying to cook in a goddamn sprite bottle, so...<br />3. You will set yourself on fire eventually if you try to cook in a sprite bottle.&nbsp; If you care about getting through the week without being in the ER, you don&#039;t want to make meth in a soda bottle.<br />4. It&#039;s essentially impossible to hide even a small scale setup if you don&#039;t have an isolated area, such as a house or garage or someplace at least a good 10+ feet from anyone else.&nbsp; Fumes carry.
