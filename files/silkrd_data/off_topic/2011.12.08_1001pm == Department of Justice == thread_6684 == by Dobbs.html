				Low hanging fruit, what better way to show your tax dollars are being spent on tackling the scourge of drugs than to bust some evil dope growers?<br />It&#039;s the same in the UK, each tiny grow op in a terraced house is paraded as a &quot;highly sophisticated operation, capable of producing hundreds of thousands of pounds of profit every few weeks&quot;. Meanwhile, the big boys pay off customs and bring in coke by the ton.

				Unfortunately, it is legal in multiple ways.<br /><br />1) The largest part people overlook is the DOJ is going out of its way to go after people who break both state and federal law. For example, a dispensary next to a school. Of course, not 100% of the busts follow this pattern, but I speculate the DOJ is going this so the state of California does not go after the federal government.<br /><br />2) Federal laws override state laws since the civil war.<br /><br />3) If the feds started pissing off a state too much (for any reason) there is a common history of state police having stand offs with the feds. This is an important note to make being that one day there will be enough anti-prohibition support to stand against the feds. This will most likely be the turning point. However, northern states tend to be a bit too peaceful, so I do not expect such drastic actions from CA any time soon. Maybe if there are medical pot laws in Texas, things will really change.

				Texas will just secede. 8) The smarter we get the more restrictive the laws get to keep us in check. I thought the feds said they wouldn&#039;t bother the medical weed growers and sellers if it was legal in the state.

				The states were never supposed to be the feds bitches. It specifically calls out each fed power in the (dead letter) Constitution and explicitly says that all powers not called out are the jurisdiction of the states.&nbsp; It says no where in that old document that the feds can tell anyone what they they can or cannot put in thier bodies. It also doesn&#039;t say that the feds can force them to buy a product like insurance either but that&#039;s another fight.<br /><br />Well, I guess you can&#039;t expect a piece of paper to restrict those who wish nothing less than your enslavement.<br /><br /><br />Funny thing, California had a ballot measure to completely decriminalize pot. The pot growers were the biggest opponents. (Well, maybe second after the bible thumpers.)<br />They cared more about their profits than than standing up to the feds. Now they are reaping what they sowed.<br /><br />This kind of protectionist attitude, the will to use the rule of law in a perverted way to make profits, is the essence of all of our problems and the clearest example of why government and especially mob rule democracy will not work in the end.<br /><br />Not that profits are bad. Just the ones that are forced by law. Law is to protect individuals from the aggression (or negligence) of their less than honest fellow man and nothing else. All other is unjust, perverted and illegitimate law and desperately needs to be seen as such by more people. Spread the word.
