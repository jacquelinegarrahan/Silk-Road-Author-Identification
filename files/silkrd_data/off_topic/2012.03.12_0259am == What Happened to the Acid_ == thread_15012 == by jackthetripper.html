				Hey, this is a good question too- where did all the acid go?&nbsp; I mean all our best vendors have no listings, guys like LSDirect or more recently Lysander Spooner, damn I wish I would have ordered a 10-strip, sitting on the 3 I have left like they were pure gold... Could it have been a bust or something?&nbsp; I messaged these sellers and will update with what they have to say, I can see that Lysander has another account now selling the same dancing bear acid (great stuff, don&#039;t get me wrong) for $21 a hit.&nbsp; But that is insane.&nbsp; For the record I paid $9 a hit for LSDirect&#039;s sour patch kids, and $13 for Lysander&#039;s blotter.&nbsp; Peace Silk Roaders!

				I think the acid is flowing fine, just not here. In the past week I&#039;ve seen a group buy for a bit of high quality crystal, a buy for a much larger amount of amber xtal, and one vendor move five tenpacks of gdf fluff and fifty vials pretty fast. I don&#039;t think any of the people who bought are going to be vending on SR though so ultimately somebody lower down the supply chain is gonna have to step up and start parting out five and ten strips otherwise the good peoples who have been gracing us with their presence here are gonna be perennially out of stock. :-(

				I know it&#039;s a while from now, but by May I know there will be a shit ton of L on here.&nbsp; Most everyone goes into production April/May for the summer batch so they don&#039;t have to make it while it&#039;s hot during the festi season.&nbsp; That&#039;s what the smart ones do anyway.&nbsp; Just wait it out, envy is getting dots, some people are claiming vials,fingers crossed...&nbsp; Only time will tell.&nbsp;

				I wish I could find some GDF Fluff again.

				Thanks for the feedback and info guys.&nbsp; I feel better now.&nbsp; Yeah I had the same feeling, that the stuff on now was sketchy, just look at the sellers lol.&nbsp; Little feedback and low numbers (100 ug) make you not want it, plus high prices.&nbsp; On Lysander&#039;s page someone called him out for saying his acid was 150 when it was half that,&nbsp; I have tried it and I don&#039;t think so!&nbsp; I mean I may be an acid n00b (4 trips) but I know that one hit had me destroyed and acid crunk, acting stupid, for over 6 hours.&nbsp; Two would have been definitely too many, and I was on the edge of needing a trip sitter for just the one.&nbsp; Luckily, I had one, but then he left me to fend for myself :(.&nbsp; Truthfully I want LSDirect&#039;s sour patch kids back, even though I had a wicked bad trip off the second time on that.&nbsp; Too strong!&nbsp; Alright kids peace. :)

				I&#039;m inclined to believe that Lysander&#039;s acid was either laid unevenly, or the people claiming it was not 150 are just lying.&nbsp; One hit of that was stronger than 2x hits of &quot;100ug&quot;.

				Calm down peoples. Here&#039;s the paper: http://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/lsd.garbrecht.pdf<br /><br />I laughed at &quot;I dont need to check any thing, ITS PUBLISHED..&quot; Having done hundreds of reactions based on supporting info from &#039;big groups&#039; papers, I can guarantee that a published procedure means shit all. When I see &#039;95% yield&#039; I know it means 62% yield on the third attempt&nbsp; :D<br /><br />And have you ever tried to remove DMF on a rotovap? It&#039;s an absolute cunt, worse than rotovaping water. To remove the quantity required for a hundred gram batch would take hours. And it would be at least overnight on a hi vac to remove all of it. It&#039;s the clingiest, shittiest solvent imaginable.<br /><br />The MSA route is crap. It&#039;s 2012 not 1972. Peptide coupling reagents allow clean amide bond formation with no epimerisation. If you have a pot of clean lysergic acid kicking around, a 100g batch of LSD would take around 12 hours work to make. <br />It would take about an hour to set up the glassware and weigh everything out; about 4 hours to run the reaction depending on which method was used; 1 hour workup and removing the solvent. If you were content to make the tartrate and pass off the cruddy mixture it as &#039;amber&#039; then that would be another 2 hours of work. Higher quality acid is either the tartrate which has been recrystallised several times or the base which has been columned with 10% MeOH/DCM/ NEt3 then salted- a large batch would take fucking hours to purify. <br /><br />If you were starting from commercial ET or Claviceps alkaloids from some Eastern Euro fermenter it would be at least another days work to prepare Lysergic acid.<br /><br /><br />Besides which it takes weeks for product to get distributed from a lab to the end user, it&#039;s not like labs lay the product themselves. I think it&#039;s entirely reasonable to suggest that this summers acid is already out the lab.

				The prep you copypastad is adapted from the 1959 paper, you even gave the ref- JOC, 24, 368 (JOC vol 24 was &#039;59). Look in the experimental section, the the final preparation for Ergonovine maleate is near identical to the prep you posted.<br /><br />The chemistry isn&#039;t new but the reagents are pretty recent- PyBop (Coste, 1990); TFFH (Carpino, 1994); HATU (Carpino, 1993) etc. Older peptide coupling protocols like DCC coupling would give significant amounts of the other diastereomers.<br /><br />Anyways, one way or another the acid will come, I&#039;m saving my BTC for Gammagoblin&#039;s restock&nbsp; :D

				The chemistry pissing contest was fun and educational, but IMO the bigger logic flaw in moo-bear&#039;s &quot;production takes hours not days dude&quot; was his implication that &quot;production&quot; means nothing but time for the basic chemical reaction.<br /><br />It would be awesome if that were true.&nbsp; For ANYTHING.&nbsp; Just think: if it takes 2 hours to assemble all the parts of an iPad 3, then we could all have them in our hands two hours after Apple&#039;s little speech last Wednesday telling us they existed.&nbsp; If it takes a thousand man-hours to build a house, I could invite a thousand friends to my vacant lot, and we&#039;d have a house built for our party an hour later! <br /><br />The real world&#039;s complicated, though.&nbsp; Getting real things done always takes more time than the people who aren&#039;t really doing those things think it should.&nbsp; Sucks, but that&#039;s the boring plodding nature of life.&nbsp; If the world was simple and magical, acid would be redundant.&nbsp; <br /><br />(And the people who actually believe other people would pay up bitcoins over lame-ass forum arguments would be rewarded.)<br />

				LMFAO, everyone on here knows I stay stocked with the needlepoint brah 8)&nbsp; Nothing but the finest.&nbsp; More L has passed through my hands than you have/will ever see in your lifetime, I can guarantee you that.&nbsp; I&#039;d bet money if you ate 4 of my headstash blotters you&#039;d need a benzo or two or you&#039;d have a psychotic episode.&nbsp; I have people that can vouch for this.<br /><br />Enjoy your last meal moo-troll, this is the last time I feed the troll :(<br /><br />Any by the way, I&#039;m talking about methods that people actually fucking use, you come in here and act like you know every fucking thing.&nbsp; I originally said people aren&#039;t in production of L atm, then you come in here and say oh it takes 2 hours to make so I don&#039;t know what the hell I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; Go fucking whip up a batch you fucking genius since you think you know so much about it.&nbsp; GTFO unless you have something valuable to contribute here, which is what my original intent was you fucking jackass.<br /><br />And why make your nym so similar to one of the biggest trolls SR has ever seen in making more and more sense.&nbsp; Moonbear is back with a new attitude folks.<br /><br />
