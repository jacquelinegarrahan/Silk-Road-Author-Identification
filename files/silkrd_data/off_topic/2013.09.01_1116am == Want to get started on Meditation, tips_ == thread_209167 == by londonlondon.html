				DISCLAIMER: please don&#039;t be put off by long post, mostly interested in you reading the first 3 lines :) <br /><br />Hello my dearest community,<br /><br />I&#039;ve been putting off meditation for the longest time now. The &#039;main reason&#039; (more like excuse) that I haven&#039;t started is because I&#039;ve read that having proper guidance throughout the &#039;meditation learning path&#039; leads to substantial advancement. <br /><br />I truly want to get started now. My question is: does anyone recommend a GOOD book? Audioguide? Video(s)? I feel that the links I find over the internet lead to generic articles. I want something genuine.<br /><br />Any and all helps is gratefully accepted.<br /><br />Background Info :P (if interested to know why I hope to add meditation to my life routine)<br />I&#039;m hoping meditation can help me out with a few issues. I am a very open minded person, but at the same time logical. I was raised as a Catholic and went to church every sunday, but through education I eventually used my own reasoning (not my parents) and realized I was an atheist (around age 16, now 26), and I took to my mind that, not only do I no longer believe in God, but I no longer believed in anything. I felt I had been cheated (not in ill-intention), in a way, all my life. I pretty much shut off any sort of spiritual belief system that existed in my being, as a sort of stupid &#039;retaliation&#039; (childish I know). But with the power that the mind has, I literally did shut everything off, physically and metaphysically. I am hoping that through meditation, I can reconnect with my spiritual self. There are a couple of other things I hope I can put in line through meditation, such as some anxiety and general focus, but mostly wanting to reconnect with my spirit.<br /><br />Thanks for your time :).<br /><br />Good vibes to all!

				This thread might help?<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=181927.0<br /><br />The brain is a muscle like anything else.&nbsp; You just have to &quot;work it out&quot;.&nbsp; It might not be fun at first.&nbsp; You might not feel you are progressing, but just stay at it.&nbsp; Your body will acclimate to any given situation.<br /><br />Don&#039;t feel like you have to go for an hour.&nbsp; Try out 5 minutes, and go from there.<br /><br />Personally I just use a candle for something to look at.&nbsp; From there I focus on the breath.&nbsp; I count from zero to one, and then count back from one to zero.&nbsp; This is the very bare bone basics.<br /><br />For a person that was raised by a television, it has changed my life, where otherwise I might be on a script for ADD.<br /><br />Good luck man.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I do, is think of nothing, yet keep one constant thought going in the background, focus on breath is usually important early on.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your brain is like a muscle, you can learn how to go into the state, deeper and deeper.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually, you may seek other ideas and techniques, just keep it simple, and don&#039;t let anything distract you.&nbsp; If you are doing it right, you will hear distracting noises, but they will not make sense.&nbsp; &nbsp;You can tune them out, and listen to your inner vibrations and cycling.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May your path be paved with gold and opium.

				As BoxofShapes said, as a beginner, you&#039;ll want to use a focal point, such as a candle, counting the breath, a nice picture. The reasoning behind this is to stop your mind from wandering. The mind will wander anyway, so don&#039;t be put off by it. Just relax and bring your focus back. <br /><br />Some people chant mantras. It works much like a focal point, except that you pick a phrase and repeat it. Some people use Ohm. I&#039;ve read that Ohm is the first sound our universe made.<br /><br />Lastly, it&#039;s important to keep your body still. Fidgeting steals your focus. Start with the half lotus, when you get good, the full lotus is used for many hours of mediation.<br /><br />Peace!

				Awesome, solid advice from everyone :). Many thanks.<br /><br />Regarding timing of the day, any feedback? I know it varies according to each person&#039;s comfort, but is there any &#039;better&#039; recommended time to do it? I read in the morning because the mind is still very quiet and hasn&#039;t been too bombarded with information. But if I have to separate 20 minutes in the morning to meditate, I honestly fear I may become undisciplined because the morning is just such a sensitive hour for me lol. Feels like minutes turn into seconds. I barely have time to brush my teeth before busting out to work. At least I know what time is &#039;not&#039; best for me haha. <br /><br />But yeah, still want to objectively ask, what are the pros/cons (if any) of doing it in the morning vs. evening?<br /><br />Good people, good vibes<br /><br />LL

				This is kind of a weird recommendation, but I recommend reading the Don Juan Series. Its not necessarily about meditation at all, but it is useful in many ways that strenghten the mind. Or can be at least.<br />Personally I like to hum as it stops internal dialogue and clears my mind.

				I&#039;d recommend trying to find the CD by Jack Kornfield that contains his guided meditations.<br /><br />I&#039;d also recommend to be really gentle and non-judgemental with yourself as you try this.&nbsp; Meditation takes practice, and is actually pretty hard at first.&nbsp; I think of meditation the same way I think of certain physical skills like playing piano or riding a bike.&nbsp; It&#039;s really hard at first and takes practice (it&#039;s really a mind/brain exercise).<br /><br />If you can stick with it, doing say even 15 minutes a day for a month..you&#039;ll be amazed at what it can do for you.<br /><br />R.

I mean it can be hard to do it regularly but morning sessions are hit and miss for me: I&#039;m just too tired. A couple hours after I wake up is usually much better. <br />And when I first started out, focusing on the breath really helped: specifically I&#039;d take a deep, slow breath in -- counting to 8 (or whatever number as long it takes you somewhere like 4+ seconds to completely fill your lungs), hold it for the same amount of time, and then breath out taking the same amount of time it took to breathe in. <br /><br />It made me light-headed a bit until I got my personal rhythm down and then it got easier. Also, iit&#039;s easy for distracting thoughts and such to pop in your head. The trick is to just let them come and go. Don&#039;t fight them, just relax and breathe and encourage your mind to empty but don&#039;t fight the thoughts that will ikely pop in. Stay relaxed and breathing and they&#039;ll slip away in the same way they came in. <br /><br />Glad to see this thread. I&#039;ve found some suggestions that I might have to check out :)<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				nothing but solid advice in this thread :D !!<br />+1 for all the great recommendations, didn&#039;t think so many good tips would come up!<br /><br />was wondering, if i use music from the start to learn to meditate, could it somehow affect me when i want to meditate without it? (maybe it&#039;s a dumb question, don&#039;t think i expressed the point i wanted to question, but still throwing it out there)<br /><br />have managed to meditate 4 out of the 9 past days (not planning on keeping count anymore, just feels good that i finally took initiative) since i started, first day went for 5 mins, today i went for 11 mins. not trying to force it, felt right. i tried with some low wave meditation music for the first time. so relaxing :), finished with a smile on my face. <br /><br />not gonna lie, my mind was racing as much today as the first day, but today, for very very brief moments, i felt how soothing it is when your mind is quiet. i felt like those instants were like clearings in a forest canopy through which the sun can seldom peak through. it felt blissful.<br /><br />i cannot claim i am the most disciplined person to pick up a &#039;habit&#039;, but this will be different. this was complete peace. i must pursue it. i shall be one with it. meditate, i will.<br /><br />LL<br />

				Third eye breathing works really well.<br /><br />Open up your shakras...you don&#039;t have to.....but it helps....and when you breathe in, picture yourself breathing in the warm rays of the sun. <br /><br />If you have any pain or discomfort, when you breathe in, direct the warm energy towards the area causing pain, raising awareness in that area. <br /><br />When you exhale, you are drawing that bad energy/pain or discomfort from inside of you and out. Breathe warm sun in.....exhale bad energy/pain out.<br /><br />Even the breathing side is very relaxing. You can do this before you go to sleep for the night, etc. A had a friend do this with me years ago, to be rid of bad energy. You could have cut the air with a knife....it&#039;s amazing how much actual energy resides within all of us...

				I usually open 3 of them. The first is below your adams apple, when you run your finger below it, it goes into a kind of dip, that<br />is your first chakra to open. To raise awareness there for the first time, pinch it if you have to.<br /><br />When you open them, you breathe in through your stomach, stomach rising, not your chest, through your nose, and then exhale through your mouth. <br /><br />Do it 2-3 times for each chakra. If your breath feels like it&#039;s not clear, then go again, 3-4 times, once your happy with slow, steady calm breathing, move to the next chakra which is further down and you&#039;ll find another little dip, it&#039;s the point where your rib cage basically ends, right in the middle.<br /><br />Again do the same. i like to do 3 breath&#039;s for every chakra.<br /><br />Then the third chakra is your navel. There the 3 basic ones that i know of.<br /><br />The person who told me about this, said imagine your high in the sky....your simply elevated, floating there with the sun in front of you, the warm rays are hitting you, touching your bare skin, and filling you with warmth and energy. With every breath breathe the warm rays of the sun, draw that energy in and guide it to where you want, need it to be.<br /><br />This breathing promotes healing also. I remember i had a huge knot in my left shoulder. I was made to lie down face first, i can&#039;t remember what she did, or what chakras she had me open, but with no manipulation, she didn&#039;t even have to touch me, but she held her hand right above the knot in my shoulder, and with that same breathing, she told me she was literally watching the knot move down and away, and eventually it was gone.<br /><br />No massage, no oils, no manipulation. There&#039;s just so much we don&#039;t know about ourselves. there&#039;s so much energy there, untapped...and certain scenarios, situations like that gives you a little insight as to what can be done with just focusing the mind, and breathing..we really take breathing for granted.<br /><br />+1 back londonlondon. Please let me know how you go with this. : )
