				here is my little story of one of the weirdest thing that happened to me so far...<br /><br />I was driving my way back home&nbsp; and saw this hitchhiker on the side of the road<br />I decided to stop and help this fella eventhough he had an intimidating appearance<br />(he was very tall ,with long dark hair ,he also had lots of piercing and tatoos)<br />Anyway I stopped cause I ve always been told not to judge a book by his cover<br /><br />The man came in the car and carried a big bag wich he was trying to fit between is legs.<br />He was silent and barely says hello to me.<br />At this point I started to feel unconfortable .<br />As said earlier he was very tall and really was struggling to fit is bag in the front between is legs<br />So I told him he can put his bag on the backseat<br />I got no reply from him and really didnt know what was going on with him<br />The atmosphere in the car was cold and I felt a bit scared<br />So I asked him again do you want to put your bag on the back seat<br />again no reply <br />I finally asked him what s inside your bag?<br />and he replied to me &quot;IF you want to know whats in the bag you ll have to SODOMIZE ME!<br />I got really surprised by his answer and pulled the car on the side and told him to get out politely<br />wich he did and slammed the door of my car<br />I felt relieved at this point <br />As I drove away from him I heard him shouting at me and realise that the strap of his bag got stuck in the door <br />So I decided to carry on a little bit because I really wanted to know what was inside the bag<br />I stopped further down the road and had a quick look inside the bag and I WAS SHOCKED BIG TIME !<br /><br />
