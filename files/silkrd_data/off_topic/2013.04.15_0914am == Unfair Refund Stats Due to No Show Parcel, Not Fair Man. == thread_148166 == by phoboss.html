				Geez.&nbsp; You and &quot;joolz&quot; sure seem to have the worst luck here and then like to start a lot of crap.&nbsp; In this case, you were given a partial refund, which I would have thought would be good news, but you want to complain about it?<br /><br />If you&#039;re upset about the refund rate no longer being 0%, then the answer is simple: just get in touch with a vendor prior to placing an order with them to let them know WHY your refund rate isn&#039;t perfect.&nbsp; Explain that you got a partial refund.&nbsp; Most of them will understand and not hold it against you.<br /><br /><br />
