				Hey lads<br /><br />Today I checked SilkRoad again after a long time of not being here and I was shocked - what the heck happened to these prices? I mean SilkRoad&#039;s never been inexpensive, but half a year ago you could actually find a decent deal or two for whatever makes you a happy man<br /><br />What do I see now? 15 fucking euros for a gram of weed<br />Why? What happened? Did someone get busted and everyone decided that prices must be higher now? Are there higher fees or what? Or is it just that enough stupid teenagers actually spend that much money for a fucking gram of bullshit weed?<br /><br />I remember buying weed and a LSD hit for 10 euros here which is a little expensive but perfectly fine and now I have to see that the prices nearly doubled holy shit<br />I mean its up to you how much you charge but I am simply confused and want to know whats up with that<br /><br />Is it because you actually make the most profit this way, you just think you make the most profit this way, are you greedy, are you forced to, is it the lack of competition or are you just plain retarded? I dont understand man what has a man to do to not feel mugged?<br /><br />Hope you dont feel offended<br />Peace

				1- Wait for harvest season broski. Prices on weed will droooopppp.<br /><br />2- LSD for a decent price seems to be a rarity here. I agree on this point completely. <br /><br />3- The prices are bullshit. But, if people are still willing to pay it, vendors will be willing to charge it. There&#039;s still some good deals, you just have to look for em.

				Thanks for your answer mate, appreciate it<br /><br />You&#039;re right I didn&#039;t think of harvest season, the only season I have in mind at the moment is the shroom season, I cant fucking wait to pluck those delicious motherfuckers off the ground (dont worry, I&#039;m not hurting them when I say &quot;pluck&quot;)<br /><br />I kind of remember one LSD vendor who was not full of bullshit, he sold five hits of LSD for about 8 €/hit and didn&#039;t claim sth like 300 µg per hit, no he was a straight up guy telling it like it is, 100 µg per hit, no bullshitting, take it or get mugged by some other guy who is lying straight to your face<br />Anyone knows who I am talking about and can tell me what happened to him? I think his name started with &quot;A&quot;, something like &quot;Acorn&quot; or so but well that&#039;s just a guess

If a vendor pegged their prices to BTC at USD$5/BTC and it is now USD$10/BTC, the prices will appear to have doubled (if you are browsing in USD mode.)
