				Hellooooooooooo peoples!&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Our new opium listings are now live. this is by far the best batch of high quality spanish opium we have had in stock. However we only have 100g left, this is the last of the opium until season begins again in May.<br /><br />Helpful hint/!! <br />Beware of sellers offering high quantities of opium stock around this time of year. It is usually the poorest quality&nbsp; &amp; oldest that was not sold last year and was kept for this time of year and is now being sold off whilst people are desperate and supplies are low. <br />Opium season begins in April or may so supplies should be back to normal then.<br /><br />Also due to the massive popularity of our joke contest and hash sale last week we have kept the sale prices at 10$ a gram whilst we get through the next few plaques of hash. At this rate they will be gone by mid week and prices will go back to normal after. <br /><br />So buy now for the last few bits of amazing quality pure sativa marroc hash directly imported from Ketama. <br /><br />ACE!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

				Hi!<br /><br />Right we´ve sold the amount we set aside for the competition. We will still honor any custom orders at the 10$ a gram price but our listings will be going back to the usual price. <br /><br />Winners and jokes to be announced shortly.<br /><br />Check http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=94723.0 For more info<br /><br />ACE
