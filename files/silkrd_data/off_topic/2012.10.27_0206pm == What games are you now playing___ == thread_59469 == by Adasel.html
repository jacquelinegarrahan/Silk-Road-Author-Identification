				We all play games at some stage right through the end, even when high.<br /><br />Currently im playing DEUS EX human revolution.&nbsp; Its a fucking corker of a game, and the payoff is great when you pull off a kill move.<br />The only thing is it can take a couple of hours to do one mission.<br /><br />What are you guys playing and how do you rate it?.

				Right now I am currently modding GTA san andreas and vice city. VC is a little less stable, but has more modding options. I actually have both Mods released in the clear web, and if you havnt played it in a while I would recomend it, you can download both games as a torrent. then you can either get a modder and mod yourself or you can download one of my mods and install it over your game.. instructions are everywhere. <br />But yea if you liked it back in the day its even better with mods.. <br />just my 2 cents

				Lollypop Chainsaw - A great zombie killer game. The main character is a hot cheerleader and she goes around with her boy friends living head strapped to her waist making tons of crude sexual jokes. I like the game alot hah. Its at least worth checking out great when your just high and you dont want a really complex game.
