				http://business.financialpost.com/2013/05/17/bitcoin-mtgox/<br /><br />Here is the link, USGovt finally decided to pull the plug on Gox in USA. I would hope that no one had their coins in that horrid exchange anyway but if you do now get them out, although it might be too late. LEO doesn&#039;t care about Gox making commission and not having to pay for a license, they know SR uses BTC and that&#039;s why they&#039;re coming for Gox! <br /><br />So long Magic The Gathering Online Exchange&nbsp; ;)

				This news is a couple days old, but I agree, they would not have seized the Dwolla account unless they have evidence of financial crimes. I believe Karpeles will be indicted and probably extradited, and it&#039;s prudent to withdraw all BTC from MtGox.<br />

				surely, this will have no affect on non-Americans using mtgox.<br /><br />Keep using it at your heart&#039;s content, if you aren&#039;t an american.
