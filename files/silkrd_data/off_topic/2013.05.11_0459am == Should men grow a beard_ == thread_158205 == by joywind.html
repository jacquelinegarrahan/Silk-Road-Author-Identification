				Women will notice your beard. Your full, thick beard marks you as an ideal specimen whose genes would combine nicely with hers to create robust and sturdy offspring. Further, your beard represents a warm place to snuggle her head against during cold winter nights in a cave - though she wouldn&#039;t be able to identify it as such and merely thinks, &quot;gee, what a sexy fvcking man. your wife despises the beard because she understands that it makes you attractive to other suitors, and should one come along that find more suitable for sex, she may be out of a mate. She will try at all costs to get your to shave it - via insults, force, etc. Be wary. Her friends are confused. They see your beard and are attracted to it, yet they must defend their friend and her beliefs. This is dangerous because their attraction will build until they can&#039;t resist any longer. <br /><br />men will respect your beard. They&#039;ll do stuff for you because they see you as someone to look up to and gain traction with. They also notice the alpha-rays that your beard emits, and those with freshly-shaven baby faces are particularly vulnerable to feeling inadequate when exposed to the radiance of your beard. <br /><br />all historical male figures worth respecting maintained some sort of facial hair. The exception is colonial/independence times, where facial hair briefly went out of fashion (think George Washington).&nbsp; buried in most individuals&#039; subconscious: the beard is what makes one a real man.

What is the Islamic view on drugs?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well alcohol is forbidden because it clouds the mind and judgment and leads to evil. <br />So some scholars say that every thing that clouds the judgment is forbidden. <br />And in the verse that is talking about alcohol is says dont pray till you know what you are saying. So my understanding is if you use a drugs and you pray and you do know what you are saying then it might prove them otherwise. <br />So scholar have been know to make mistakes because there understanding only stems from pure understanding of the Quran and the teaching of the Prophet. And not form actual experience. <br />Example on lucid dreaming a scholar said it is impossible because in in Islamic understand sleep is a know as small death and then so you cannot be awake when you sleep. This wrong because people experience lucid dreams.<br />Second an other scholar said playing FPS games does not prepare people for war. <br />Yet the US army uses FPS games in some situation to train its soldiers. So my conclusion is that they might be wrong about some drugs to. <br />I am an amateur psychologist of sorts God willing will start my really psychology study soon.<br />At this point I am doing research on how much some drugs really cloud the judgment and if so can the be used to benefit people in more ways then recreational.&nbsp; <br />But this would not be the biggest sin. The biggest sin is assigns equals and partners to Allah in worship. <br />Supplication some one else will He is the one who has power over every thing. <br />A friend one told me that there was an traveler called Ibn Batutah and he could communicate with other people with the mind. I am talking about telepathy. So maybe some drugs can boost this ability. <br /><br />But because I got scammed on first real order I my research has been postponed till next month.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I hope this answers your question.<br /><br />Do you want to know more.

I believe in the underlying unity of all religions. What is the Islamic view on drugs?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well alcohol is forbidden because it clouds the mind and judgment and leads to evil. <br />So some scholars say that every thing that clouds the judgment is forbidden. <br />And in the verse that is talking about alcohol is says dont pray till you know what you are saying. So my understanding is if you use a drugs and you pray and you do know what you are saying then it might prove them otherwise. <br />So scholar have been know to make mistakes because there understanding only stems from pure understanding of the Quran and the teaching of the Prophet. And not form actual experience. <br />Example on lucid dreaming a scholar said it is impossible because in in Islamic understand sleep is a know as small death and then so you cannot be awake when you sleep. This wrong because people experience lucid dreams.<br />Second an other scholar said playing FPS games does not prepare people for war. <br />Yet the US army uses FPS games in some situation to train its soldiers. So my conclusion is that they might be wrong about some drugs to. <br />I am an amateur psychologist of sorts God willing will start my really psychology study soon.<br />At this point I am doing research on how much some drugs really cloud the judgment and if so can the be used to benefit people in more ways then recreational.&nbsp; <br />But this would not be the biggest sin. The biggest sin is assigns equals and partners to Allah in worship. <br />Supplication some one else will He is the one who has power over every thing. <br />A friend one told me that there was an traveler called Ibn Batutah and he could communicate with other people with the mind. I am talking about telepathy. So maybe some drugs can boost this ability. <br /><br />But because I got scammed on first real order I my research has been postponed till next month.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I hope this answers your question.<br /><br />Do you want to know more.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>So drugs that cloud the judgment are bad. Then are drugs that increase awareness are good? I wonder what a Muslim would think of LSD.

				what are you talking about. I think you dont understand my point.<br />You are free to believe and live your life like you want.<br /><br />I am not forcing you to grow you beard do I. If you ask me why I grow a beard I explain because...<br /><br />Send me something. I just wonder did you even watch? I dont think you did. <br /><br />I was attack first so replied in kind. I never called any one ignorant. Some call all people how believe in God. Ignorant well<br /><br />I see that there is a lot ignorance in the world about religion and a specially about Islam. I just want to clarify some issues that is all.<br /><br />Well so we disagree on what is truth? You believe you evolved from a monkey. Well be a monkey then. <br /><br />And now you do the same you accuse me of the same thing I accuse you of and then you accuse me.<br />So now I accuse you of the same thing you accuse me of. You also Ignore every rational argument I made and hide behind your one quasi philosophical scientific thingy got going there in you mind. <br /><br />I good say the something about you. <br /><br />And hate me all you want and my that hate burn you up. <br />I dont hate you I pity for having to resort to such language.<br /><br />Would you rather care I send type out all the fact for you. I thought I would be easier on your brain to just watch something informative and its definitely&nbsp; not indoctrinating. Just interesting to watch. <br />Just to remove some misconception.&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Come on, fellas. Play nice. People are entitled to believe whatever they want, as ridiculous as it might be to one person, its another person&#039;s faith and opinion. <br /><br />Religion causes enough disagreement in the real world, lets not start the same trend on the road, eh? <br /><br />Frankly, I think people feel so strongly about their beliefs that yes, we might have a better world as a whole without it, but it does help some people on a individual basis and thats still worth something. I think the best solution is believe what you like, and keep your mouth shut about it in public places 8)

				First of all this tread was about beards right. Somebody made a post about (not me) if he&#039;s beard was to long he would look like an al-Qaida terrorist. And then the hollow tread got derailed in to an religious argument. <br /><br />And what is religion. Is just an other ideology, just like democracy, communist, anarchism, crypto - anarchism. <br /><br />Do just sugest we stop discussion on ideology all tougher?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				If I may quote for the few words for DRP as can be found on the Silk Road site <br /><br />I&#039;d like to take a moment to share with you what Silk Road is and how you can make the most of your time here. Let&#039;s start with the name. The original Silk Road was an old world trade network that connected Asia, Africa and Europe. It played a huge role in connecting the economies and cultures of these continents and promoted peace and prosperity through trade agreements. It is my hope that this modern Silk Road can do the same thing,<br /><br />And since the Silk Road also ran true Islamic lands its more then fitting that there should be a Muslim around.<br />For the culture exchange. Would you not agree.
