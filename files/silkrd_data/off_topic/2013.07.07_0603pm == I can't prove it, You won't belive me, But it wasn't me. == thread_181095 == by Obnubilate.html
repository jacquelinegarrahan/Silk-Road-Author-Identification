				There was a thread posted about me kidnapping women.<br />There are also IRC logs in Atomos&#039; IRC channel<br /><br />I can&#039;t prove I didn&#039;t post those things,<br />I can&#039;t prove it wasn&#039;t me saying what was said,<br />All I can say is that I wasn&#039;t on here for like 2 days.<br /><br />Someone has been trying to repeatedly dox me and slander my name for some reason, and idek whats going on anymore.<br /><br />Someone guessed or cracked or knew or something my IRC password, and logged in as me and then posted thoes things.<br />But it wasn&#039;t me.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what more to say, except to offer my deepest apologies to the community and and female members I may have offended.<br /><br />I have taken steps to change my passwords and secure my account, and idefk.<br /><br />It just wasn&#039;t me. I don&#039;t post things like that. I wasn&#039;t on drugs, I wasn&#039;t anything, I wasn&#039;t online. I was either asleep or wishing i was dead, IRC certainly was the least of my problems. My website is fucked my forum reputation is fucked, everything is fucked.<br /><br />I&#039;m stupid<br /><br />and im sorry<br />im sorry. :&#039;(

				I read it, but am not quite sure what you want me or anyone else here to do about it....<br /><br />You pissed someone off I guess.<br /><br />But do you mean your reputation on here, because you know, this is a forum made up of drug dealers and users? Our reputations are not of the utmost importance to us probably.
