				What happened to all the intelligent people we had posting on the forum? <br />People like Wowzers, etc. that actually could hold a conversation.<br />We&#039;re getting over run with your average street level IQ thugs.<br />When I first joined this place it was filled with intelligent people with great information.<br />I can&#039;t even fuck with people anymore they are too ignorant to understand. <br /><br />Kind of a shame that sr is becoming like a average project in the hood filled with ingnorance.

				Maybe a lot of the smart people are sitting back and observing the trends. After you&#039;ve been on the road for a while the mentality of security changes. It did for me.<br /><br />A lot of people get too free with their conversations and later regret posting information or may just want to tone down on speaking their interests(besides drugs). A crafty intelligence officer can piece these things together you know?

				I know people lose sight of priorities when they think they&#039;re invincible. I was checking a vendor out last night with a picture of a chick that had a bandana over her face selling US domestic rolls. I&#039;m sure this kid has been in trouble before and sure as hell doesn&#039;t have common sense since he tried to pawn off a bag of baking soda as 1/2g fentanyl(Both the vendor and buyer should&#039;ve been popped across the head).<br /><br />Everything is on the computer therefore the computer is the medium. This makes it extremely easy for intel officials to perform their magic and busts retards like above. One crack in the vase will leak as much water as you let it-so don&#039;t keep filling it!-i.e. personal info/interests.

				Its just a reflection of the internet in general and what happens when sites become more popular. Look at a place like bluelight in the early 2000s compared to now. Also, the internet gives the ability for people to quickly find information and news, its also gives crackpots and blowhards a soapbox to stand on and shout from.

				Yes that&#039;s exactly the type of people I am talking about. <br />That person is extremely careless, using yahoo emails.<br />Has ads on Topix, where she was scamming people.<br />Anyone interested in tracking them down could do it easily.<br /><br />Looks like another scammer was using their youtube name on here.<br />Some peoples children...
