But it&#039;s usually an almost-catch-22 type of situation, where consumption is legal but buying, selling, growing/making your own, stocking it anywhere or just carrying it on your person are all illegal. So, if you happen to find some laying around and use it immediately, you&#039;re not committing a felony... unless it can be argued that it was evidence that someone else was planning or trying to commit or had already committed a felony, in which case you&#039;re obstructing the flow of justice.<br /><br />I know for a fact that this is true of most illegal drugs in Brazil, Chile, Peru and Argentina (though marijuana is legal in Peru and has questionable legality in Argentina, and cocaine is also legal for personal use in Peru... sort of. You can grow a whole forest of coca if you want, so long as you don&#039;t refine the product. When I lived there, a day didn&#039;t go by when I didn&#039;t either drink coca tea or chew coca leaves, so I was technically a regular cocaine user).

				Technically, your a criminal when you commit a crime(no matter how minor it is), however practically(or from a more chaotic point of view) your a criminal only when someone(except for you) know that you&#039;ve commited a crime. Just as no one knows if a tree fell in the forest unless someone heard\saw it or see it after.

				The most legally sound answer to your question, at least from the point-of-view of a criminal theorist (if you ask police you&#039;ll get a different answer, of course) is this:<br /><br />The moment it becomes proven in a court of law that you committed a conduct which constitutes a crime, you retroactively become a criminal from the moment when you committed that crime forward. You cease being a criminal when you finish serving your sentence, be that jail time, community service, paying a fine or anything else.

				What is Law, whose Law? Statute Law that people consent to, to be governed by? What about Supreme Law... Law of the Land etc etc<br /><br />If you have No intent to harm Others, You are not a Criminal to me.

Even before you take delivery. You could be charged with intending to possess/import illicit substances (or whatever the correct legal term is).. once you take delivery, you can be charged with another offense...actual possession... and depending on the quantity, you might be charged with yet another offense....intent to supply... even if you have no intention of dealing, some law enforcement take the view having more than a quantity considered personal use, automatically puts you into the category of a drug dealer.. crazy eh. criminalising people without any evidence of intent to supply. <br /><br />This is why if you ever get caught, like so many others have said, say nothing at all about anything, concerning ordering or anything else...anything you say could help LE secure a conviction on any of the above charges. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
