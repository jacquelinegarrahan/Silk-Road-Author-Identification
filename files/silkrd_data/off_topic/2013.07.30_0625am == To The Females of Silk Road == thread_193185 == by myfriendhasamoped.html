				I recently started dating a lady of the black nature(I&#039;m trying not to sound racist, but I&#039;m pretty sure I just fucked that up) lol....anyways she&#039;s black....and hot. <br />We seem to have different tastes in drugs. She&#039;s never done synthetics or anything other than the big three. What drug can you recommend to &quot;bring us together&quot;...?

				Not a female but of the 2c class I&#039;d recommend 2cb. I&#039;ve had some of the best bonding moments with friends and lovers over it of all the 2c family that I&#039;ve done which is all of it.

				That&#039;s exactly what I was thinking...now how to convince her its &quot;safe&quot;. She&#039;s 30+ and I&#039;m more than that, so its not like we&#039;re kids(she&#039;s actually a grandmother...lol).&nbsp; &nbsp;She&#039;s never done a psychedelic, or even X. <br /><br />I&#039;ve talked to her about it, she has it in her head that everything that isn&#039;t weed, coke, or heroin...is acid.....and she is going to have a bad trip or freak out.&nbsp; I tell her shes way off base , but she doesn&#039;t believe the white devil....lol.&nbsp; I guess we could just keep fucking and freaking on each other(neither of us has ever been with other race) but that won&#039;t last.&nbsp; And neither will us as a couple....I guess I&#039;m just trying to squeeze out a little more fun before it ends.&nbsp; Oh well....back to boring white chicks.(pills...pills...and more pills)

				I&#039;m with the MDMA folks on this one - will definitely be an experience to remember - my &#039;closest&#039; friends are those who i&#039;ve rolled with in my youth, even though I may not see them too much anymore. Can&#039;t beat that empathetic bond ;)

				My wife had never rolled before we got together. In fact, she doesn&#039;t do any recreational pharmaceuticals at all, as she is a health care professional. However, when I got her to read the abstracts about the first synthesis of MDMA, and why the guy invented it, she was much more receptive. <br /><br />Now we roll together about once every few months or so, and it is magical. All of her demons and anxieties fade away into the shadows, and she is relaxed, with that euphoric body and mind high that only good X gives.<br /><br />That is my recommendation for you and your lady, capsules so she doesn&#039;t have to taste how foul and bitter the stuff is, and have your surroundings set up before hand, and enjoy.

				I&#039;d go with MDMA too... not just for the reasons above, but also because I think it has the potential of erasing all the prejudices towards drugs (at least that&#039;s what it did for me). It&#039;s something so blissful and so pure that dissolves almost instantaneously the conception of drugs as an evil thing. Just go and put all the evidences on the table. Inform her comprehensively about the substance (without boring her nor looking like a freak) and just... take off...
