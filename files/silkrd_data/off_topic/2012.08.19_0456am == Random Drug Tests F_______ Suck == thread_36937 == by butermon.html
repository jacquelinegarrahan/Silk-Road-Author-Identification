				So I&#039;ve been working at Zaxbys for nearly 4 years now. I started out as a minimum wage cashier in high school and I&#039;m now an assistant manager. My lovely district manager decides to inform me that they will start random drug testing all employees. I mean come on, why does it matter if I smoke a little MJ a few times a month, I am a college student. I&#039;ve never been high at work and I surely don&#039;t plan to. I&#039;m a great employee and have great customer service, even the owners tell me how good of a job I&#039;ve done. So why the fuck would you have to drug test an employee who is doing their job well. Why the hell would it matter what I do in my own spare time. It obviously does not effect the way I work. I can definitely pass a drug test, I haven&#039;t smoked in a month and a half; however, I&#039;m mad at the fact that my job is trying to control my life outside of work.&nbsp; I will be going back to college and would love to smoke some bud with some friends. I guess I&#039;ll have to indulge myself in the many other drugs that they don&#039;t test (LSD, Shrooms, Dmt,........................). Sorry for ranting I just had to let it out.

				You might want to edit your post. Nobody needs to know where you work. <br />Random drug testing does suck. I don&#039;t know what kind of store you work for, but if you&#039;re feeling ballsy, you could always talk to the person who is directly in charge of you. Let them know that you are a hard worker, and your history with the company, as well as positive reviews from coworkers, that you are a serious worker, and assure them that anything that you do outside of work is your own business and that it in no way effects your performance. You do not have to go into any details about which drugs you use, or the frequency that you use them. <br /><br />I used to work for a HIV/AIDS clinic and did this once word got around about drug testing. You have to be as professional as possible and be sure that you are going to the person that is directly in charge, not your manager/supervisor, ect. From what I&#039;ve read, it sounds like it&#039;s a small mom and pop type of store (family owned, not a chain/corp). Go to the owners and be honest with them. <br /><br />or...<br /><br />You could just go to the owners and say that you tried cannabis for the first time a week ago (and hated it, of course), and that you&#039;re really scared that a positive drug test will really hurt your reputation. <br /><br />sdesu

				Unfortunately when you work for someone else they pretty much own you. Yes, it is lame but even though I have a bad GHB habit which can&#039;t be detected on a drug test anyway, I can&#039;t say I&#039;d want anyone working for me that does drugs. But then again, if they are doing their job right, and not walking in with glazed eyes acting like a retard smelling of MJ, then I wouldn&#039;t have a problem as long as I don&#039;t know about it. I&#039;ve been self-employed for many years now. That is the only way I can work.

				Every place I have ever worked always talked about random drug testing. I have been &quot;randomly&quot; tested exactly once. It happened after I expressed my opinion to the boss that Willie Nelson&#039;s arrest for pot possession was crap, and that I thought it should be legal. I was sent down the very next morning for a piss test. Which I passed! Fuck them!<br /><br />Everywhere else talked about random testing but only seemed to randomly test people who were injured at work.<br /><br />Personally, I think the whole drug testing racket is BS and used by companies as a possible out for undesirable employees. <br />
