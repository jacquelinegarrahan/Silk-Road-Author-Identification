				I was hooked on WoW for a good year or so but just ended up being bored by the grind fest that it was.<br />For christmas i got myself an Xbox and played it ever since.<br />Now i realised something, i dont really NEED xbox live to play solo games at all do I??<br />I was thinking about canning the 40 quid a month or whatever it is, subscription fee and going to Star Wars online.<br />Anyone care to help me out here??

				Download the trial first that&#039;s what i done, i think you can play till your character levels to 15.<br />I had high hopes for it but after a while it just gets abit samey for me..a disappointment after 24 gigs of waiting.

				I also played some WoW and got bored of it for the same reasons as you mentioned, the grinding became very old. I decided to give SW a try when it was first released and thought it was ok but WoW burnt me out so much I think I was just over MMOs. I got to around level 25 so I didnt get too deep into the game but it was decently developed from what I saw. The questing is really polished, each quest plays out like a movie or cut scene and you are given a choice on how to complete each quest adding dark side or light side points that effects your character over time. PvP looked like it had the possibility of being pretty good and I really cant comment on raiding since I never got around to giving that a go. I think the trial is the way to go, that way your not stuck $60 if youre over it after a couple of hours. Like I said I played it when the game was first released so Im sure they have also worked out a lot of the flaws, but have no interest in giving it a second chance.

				Yeah i head SW had a few flaws in it.<br />But games such as WoW and Eve Online, make you feel like you have second job for fuck sake.<br />I went back to eve online after a years absence, got attacked by rats in low sec after a split second mistake in course plotting and lost everything.&nbsp; The same can happen to you in WoW if you get your account hacked, which is easier than loosing&nbsp; a ship it seems.<br />I really hope star wars becomes what it set out to do.
