				Ever wonder how rich and famous stars like Charlie Sheen get away with making millions of dollars in cocaine? They rip off the plot of The Producers and make a shitty movie that nobody watches so they can clean all their drug monies. Case in point: Food Fight, the product placement laden animated movie with celebrity voices and nightmarish production values. It took ten years to make, $65 million dollars, and after a limited release in the UK grossed just $73,706. That&#039;s over $880 spent for every dollar gained.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the trailer, CLEARNET LINK: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uROQ9nplxIY<br /><br />I haven&#039;t watched this movie, but based on the wikipedia article, this movie was never intended for children&#039;s eyes. There a lots of raunchy moments which suggest nobody cares what little Billy thinks of Food Fight. It&#039;s the definition of a dumb piece of shit movie and the only reason it could possibly exist is because cocaine. I think it&#039;s also the reason Tommy Wiseau made The Room.

				I don&#039;t think Charlie Sheen would be selling cocaine.<br />He probably buys it by the KG, but why would he sell it when he was making $1 million+ per episode.<br /><br />He made $100 million+. Even if he used 1kg cocaine / month (which would not even be possible). 1kg cocaine in the US would be $40K tops for high quality.<br />If he was using 1kg / month he&#039;d be spending $500,000 / year. So that&#039;s 200 years of cocaine. Why would he bother to sell it?<br /><br />

				&nbsp;:-X&nbsp; I&#039;d say if someone had true knowledge of goings on at that level that they would either be in on it or people in the know would want to have a little talk with that person.&nbsp; hmm?

				The Room was the most hilariously terrible movie i&#039;ve ever seen. I don&#039;t know how Tommy spent $6 million making it, it looks worse than some of the movies we made in high school film &amp; TV classes.<br /><br />Some of the lines were just hilarious in how bad they were, the director had no idea how terrible his plot and script were and what a laughing stock he is, it looked like the actors were even trying not to laugh the whole way through the movie.<br /><br />&quot;Enough of these personal questions... so how is your sex life?&quot;<br />&quot;I&#039;m not pregnant, there is no baby.... I just said that to make things interesting&quot;<br /><br />I really recommend everyone watch this movie. It&#039;s so bad it&#039;s actually a brilliant unintentional comedy.<br /><br />How Tommy Wiseau came up with $6 million no-one knows, in his interviews he just rambles incoherently and never actually replies to the actual questions people ask him, he&#039;s such a nut-case.
