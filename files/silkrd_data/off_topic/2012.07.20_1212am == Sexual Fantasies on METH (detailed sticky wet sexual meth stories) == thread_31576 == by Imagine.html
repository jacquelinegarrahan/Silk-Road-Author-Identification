				The more intimate the better. Share your deepest METH driven sexual thoughts, secrets, and play, solo or otherwise. If you are like me, some of the wildest sexual thoughts and deeds you&#039;ve ever had were inspired by or experienced while rushing on METH. I found the following post from a user who calls herself &quot;Methology.&quot; This material is wonderful...<br />From: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24703.0<br /><br />If you&#039;ve had deeply sexual experiences on METH or just a funny story then please share them with the SR community. Believe me, nothing is taboo unless it involves children or hurting others. Let&#039;s keep this civil...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24703.msg263441#msg263441">Quote from: methology on May 29, 2012, 04:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I heard IV ice and sex are phenomenal so I did .3g iv several days ago for the first time. I was alone, waiting for a friend to come over and join me in the usual play. I wasn&#039;t more than a couple minutes into the most incredible rush of my life when realized I just had to get my pants off and put something, anything, inside me. When my friend showed up, I didn&#039;t answer the door. What I was doing seemed way more important than the minute or two I might make my friend wait. It was over an hour later when I remembered the the door bell rang and it didn&#039;t even matter. Even though I was shaking, I managed to register and hit another .3, fuck! It was three days before stopped feeling sore down there and almost a week before I wanted to see or speak with anyone.&nbsp; <br /><br />So what I did to myself while I was rushing was kinkier than anything I&#039;ve ever read about and I would never share the details with anyone I knew personally. All I did was review that day trying to remember the things I did and put inside my body.<br /><br />Have you been to this sensational place? I&#039;ve never had anything feel so sexual before in my life. It felt like pure sensation and the world was way over there somewhere. Is more better? Let me know where you&#039;ve been, you know what I mean...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24703.msg263798#msg263798">Quote from: methology on May 29, 2012, 09:30 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">endorfin, I am female and I appreciate your comments on &quot;Is more better?&quot; The Indiana Jones analogy is spot on but I am tempted to try a .5 IV next time. I weigh 106lbs so that&#039;s probably my limit. Thing is, I just don&#039;t get off. I never come during sex or even with a vib but with this, I just came and came and came, god! Maybe if I do a couple of lines I will get in the mood to write about this experience in greater detail.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24703.msg264953#msg264953">Quote from: methology on May 30, 2012, 03:09 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sorry everyone, I was still pretty methed up when I posted those comments. Now I realize this could become, as one reader put it, a lurid porn story. I suppose if I had filmed myself I might have won a nomination but my intent was to exclaim my sudden drug fueled lust. It&#039;s true though, having never had an orgasm before, I was the benefactor of both a wild drug experience and the discovery of my own true carnal knowledge. It&#039;s taken me a while to digest all of this, as you can imagine, and I can&#039;t stop thinking about dissolving more shards to see if I can go back there, and there in-lies the problem with this drug.<br /><br />There is something about this drug that directs one&#039;s focus towards sex. While I was rushing, I was thinking about and imaging mostly torsos and genitalia the whole time, both female and male. It was frustrating because although I am fit and quite flexible, I can only get within about an inch of my kitty and I wanted so much to suck myself. Listen, all of you, please treat this professionally. I am really trying to understand this myself, and sharing it with you on the forum helps me articulate my thoughts. I have always been hetero, and this is the first time I have found the female anatomy sexually stimulating. Now that I am not high I find the thought of mouth to kitty disgusting. How does that work? I think I now understand what men mean when they say &quot;It was just sex!&quot;&nbsp; Sorry guys, I’ll never give you any shit for that one again.<br /><br />I&#039;ll get back to you later.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=24703.msg266572#msg266572">Quote from: methology on May 31, 2012, 03:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Zerd thank you for your input on MDMA and weed. You’ll be happy to know I do have lots of warm, fuzzy, emotionally close relations. My problem is I never achieve orgasm. I get real close and then it just fades. That happens during intercourse and when I play solo with my toys. I have done MDMA and had sex. We were already high on weed. It was wonderful but I still stalled just short of an orgasm. I love sex and have always been resentful about not being able to really get off good. I’m in my mid twenties and all through high school and college my friends would talk about their earth shaking orgasms. A couple of them could get off real easy, really pissed me off. I sort of knew what it was going to feel like because of what the buildup felt like, but I wanted it way stronger. <br /><br />When I posted my IV meth experience I was not only elated by that fabulous rush but also that I had just experienced my first full body orgasm. And to top that off, I just kept having them while I was rushing really hard. I was almost getting off from the meth. That’s why I just had to get my pants off and touch myself. All it took was a finger on my button with the hood pulled way back, and it all got so fucking intense.&nbsp; I also did some other really kinky things that I’m sure the meth had a whole lot to do with. God that was fun! Looking back, I just can’t believe I did that stuff, and how really good it felt.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Wow, the guy at the door ringing the bell was unaware she was ringing her own bell.<br /><br />Mrs Red does coke and that can set her off - hard to breath down there but hey, we ensure these things!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />I used to write porn. Back in the day. But I&#039;m not giving away some wank to anyone out there when even crack hookers get at least £5 - 10.<br /><br />Maybe I ought to sell porn stories themed to whatever gets you off.<br /><br />Things you do for a bitcoin!
