				Well, DrGonzo, actually&nbsp; :-[ It started a few days ago when I began researching him in order to buy btc. I read through some of his posts and came across his (sexy) haiku and now there are moments where I find myself imagining he has this 10 inch cock and I&#039;m riding him reverse-cowgirl over a sea of bitcoins...<br /><br />Anyway, maybe it&#039;s residual effects from the molly I took this weekend or the anonymity factor and knowing I&#039;ll never meet him in real life but, I&#039;m curious, has anyone else had thoughts like this?&nbsp;

				Sometimes I wish we could all meet together like Woodstock only with even more drugs, and just relax and chill out in the fresh air with nobody there to judge you or arrest you or make you feel bad. And sex is involved at some point too, in a kind of carefree intense way with whatever drug you choose guiding you along. That would be really nice.

				Good god man! Alien fingers......&nbsp; :D Funny thing, the male g-spot is located um, well, you know where it&#039;s located. I don&#039;t know whose idea it was to locate it there, but it&#039;s there. Some girls know about it and sometimes gently put a finger around that area. Don&#039;t knock if you haven&#039;t tried it lol. Take the plunge, so long as she’s not too “traditional”. You’ll thank me, I promise. I&#039;m going to edit this in 10 minutes.

Yeah, BlagRag suggested I might get another avatar. Laptop screens are a lot smaller than computer screens, so I can&#039;t make out what my avatar looks like. I can see Marge Simpson but everything else is a blur. For all I know it could be Jesus Christ preaching to the Corinthians. (....... but probably not.......)<br /><br />TY for the vibrator link. You&#039;re right, these are quite pricey, but due to the construction, material and overall quality. They&#039;re much too smooth to be functional, I think. The upside is, they&#039;ll probably come out easy if accidentally, erm..... swallowed. I&#039;m staggered there are not more double-action ones. I think you&#039;re missing out with single action, yet majority sold are. Want to know something funny? The pricey ones are usually made from companies that care about image more than content, so the lesser name brands are more likley to stock more &quot;functional&quot; ones. But if you&#039;re buying, I guess it&#039;s your choice.<br /><br />If they&#039;re too expensive, just use a 2 litre bottle of Schweppes, accidentally on purpose drop it, then gently...... can I actually say this? Probably not, or bloodbath might tell me to get off, and not in the good way.<br /><br />I think I&#039;ve said too much.

I hope it had nothing to do with LEs; it certainly appears from her posts that she could have been a significant threat to them, and a virtual avatar for Silk Road. I don&#039;t know anything about it other than she disappeared in mid November with the blackouts, that the account was modified early December to remit her sex, and then accessed again on 18 December by someone who was obviously not her, and I don&#039;t think it was her mom.<br /><br />Tell me I&#039;m wrong. Read her posts and tell me she wouldn&#039;t have been a priority. I&#039;m just amazed, and quite frankly a bit embarrassed, that no one on SR (except pine) has thought of even returning the slinging. I&#039;m sure there must be SOME hackers here.

I won&#039;t hire a hacker so don&#039;t PM me for soliciting if you are, but if I was I sure as shit wouldn&#039;t be turning the other cheek.<br /><br />Anyway, didn&#039;t mean to write this much.

Thanks but I didn’t have sweet dreams lol. I had a super realisitic dream I had a huge fight with Lim, and I started my own vending account because he fired me (I worked for him pmsl). Insane. And yesterday I was in and out of sleep and this image of Rox leaving the door open after the pizzaman made a delivery, and ACE said, shut the fucking door. pmsl.

NewAmsterdam has the best in my opinion (both for value and quality), LloydsBrothers are also very good but pricey, and I&#039;ve heard positive things about Magic Moments and Nod with the bitchin tar, but these two vendors only send to the US/Canada so they&#039;re no good for me. <br />Here&#039;s NewAmsterdam&#039;s review page:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91689.0 <br />I&#039;ve posted a home test result here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91689.msg657316#msg657316 <br />More pictures of my latest order here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=91689.msg696637#msg696637 <br />And here&#039;s the link to his vendors page:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/09344ef2f0 <br />If you fancy trying a .5 sample it&#039;s 4.39 btc, which I think is very reasonable, it&#039;s absolutely mind blowing material :D

I think it&#039;s best for everyone if you just don&#039;t go near them at all. Maybe see a shrink, or drop some acid.

If you have problems sleeping try melatonin and chamomile tea, it does wonders and it&#039;s natural.

I agree with you I think mandy is fantastic, I&#039;ve always had so much fun rolling, however much I enjoy coke mandy gives you much more bang for your buck ;)

				Thanks for the advice, Prin! You&#039;re right, I generally smoke sativa dom strains. Right now I have purple diesel, actually, which is a pretty energetic high. Not sure why I hadnt thought of chamomile tea, I drink that before bed all the time! I&#039;ve never tried Melatonin, I&#039;ll have to do some research. I tryyyyyyyy to stay away from pharmies but if I had one the other night/morning I would have taken it!! Maybe I&#039;ll get a few just to keep on hand for emergencies.

In terms of greenery your best avoiding the sativa strains as they&#039;re uplifting, when you&#039;re already high it defeats the object of coming down, you definitely need a heavy indica to help you drift off into calm and relaxation strains like grand daddy purple and blueberry kush are brilliant for this but any heavy indica should do wonders, and don&#039;t forget to have some chamomile tea to hand. I agree with you hun I try to avoid pharmies too, the natural approach is definitely the way forward :)

Sorry!!<br />Yes Raz, we all make mistakes. Some of us learn from them and some of us don&#039;t. I love your investigative nature and the methodology you use. Awesome stuff and food for thought!&nbsp; :) Your certainly an interesting character Raz, a most interesting persona.&nbsp; :) :)

				Lol, did you think I meant I like to play hide and seek??? pmsl. More a reference to obscure information. I kind of grow bored with train-type chat. The only information worth knowing is the information that no one&#039;s talking about lol. You usually don&#039;t come across anything but cheap conversations these days.

				Personally I think when DPR is done making his fortune he should buy himself a small oil platform, declare it a sovereign nation and invite us all there to have a drug fueled sex fest for a month or two. While the road is likely occupied by more guys than gals, I suspect almost all of us have partners who reap the benefit of our membership and would love to come along to equal out the numbers. Otherwise we could just put a few flyers up at local strip clubs and I am sure we could trick some hoties into coming out with us.<br /><br />We could call it &quot;Florinpaluzia&quot; or &quot;Miracle Man&quot; in honor of DPR&#039;s lineage. <br /><br />

Otherwise we could just put a few flyers up at local strip clubs and I am sure we could trick some hoties into coming out with us.<br /><br />We could call it &quot;Florinpaluzia&quot; or &quot;Miracle Man&quot; in honor of DPR&#039;s lineage. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It doesn&#039;t take much to start up a sovereign nation these days just a little imagination and initiative, take a look at this guy (clearwebalert) http://www.sealandgov.org/ I think it&#039;s a very cool place, I must visit one day just so I can say I&#039;ve been to the &#039;Principality of Sealand&#039; and start up a random conversation about my adventure!

				Wow. Must be in your good books lately Princess, or maybe you’re in a really good (and flirty) mood tonight! ::) Thanks for sharing that lol. I’m sure I’m not the only one who slightly hardened over that post. I wonder if this is the time to mention my mind wandered a few days ago&nbsp; ??? and I thought about me and some of the other guys on SR, Ballz, modziw, Ahoyhoy and rest, came to your place selling girl-scout cookies and you invited us in for a coffee, which turned into champagne and dessert, and we ended ^ having a massive orgy for some reason. :o We found some rope you left lying around……........................ anyway, it was great (you loved it). ::) We all made cocktails, ate sexy fruit (strawberries and cantelope mainly) and did eccies all night. If you’ve got soft rope or some frilly cuffs we might be in for a good night lol. (Though this time I’ll try not to lose the key!! That killed the romance a bit lol! It had fallen out of my pocket when I got out of the car, looked EVERYwhere bedore finding it not to the amusement of my now ex. Handcuffs not even mine, I “borrowed” them from a little kid and then was too ashamed to give them back to him. I bought him a gift to make ^ for it.)&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Anyway I’m not going to let this post go too far, but like Wado I’m glad it’s still going strong. Had some great convos earlier on thread so have always come back to it. It’s my favourite so far. And I wasn’t joking when I said I pmsl’d my bed. :&#039;( That phucking post from ACE and the misunderstanding on how to use a 2 litre bottle of Schweppes as a sex toy, and then thinking about the guy who invented plastic bottles did it specifically so ACE could use to hot-knife opium, and then thought phuc it, you could also put liquid in them and sell as drink, was too much and it spilled out of me onto the bed. Classic. ::) (I’m very clean so it wasn’t as bad as it could have been.)<br /><br />Speaking of ACE, have not seen for a while.&nbsp; :-\ Figured he went to another rave but that was a while ago. Give us ^ date ACE! Or we might think things. Come back and sell us more ope.<br /><br />ProudCannabian! Good job, 8/9 times in one night!! How did you manage? :o Nice job bob. You can be our new sex role-model along with Ahoyhoy. 8 or 9 times, what were you on dude?&nbsp; ??? Interesting night out. I have to disagree that it’s all mental though. Abstaining works. It’s just not healthy is all. I notice it helps in gym, all that aggression pent ^ is good to work with. For some reason girls seem to notice as well though I can’t explain it. :P I don’t mind being flirted with, except by those who hang outside the gym doors and simply look everyone ^ and down when leaving.&nbsp; &gt;:( That doesn’t impress me. The ones inside do though.&nbsp; ;) Hmm, abstaining vs non-abstaining….. I don’t know how you managed to do it ProudCannabian, as a general rule the less you do it the better for rope levels when you finally do do it. Hmm. IMAHO, once a day is too much. Starts to be mechanical. Just tell her you have a “headache” but you’ll do it later when you feel “better”. But can you manage to last all week without nothing more than light teasing? If you can, I’d recommend it. Tell me the difference you feel.<br /><br />Hmm. I don’t want to turn into relationships expert though. This thread being what it is, I feel a little slack is warranted though.<br /><br />P.S. I always seem to say the wrong thing lol, if above is too randy tell me Miss PM and I’ll edit. Don’t be offended and decide not talk to me or I’ll be crushed lol! Being a sex thread, I was just being honest and trying to have a little fun (even if all true). I assume it’s healthy to fantasise every now and then, it’s part of being human. It’s the people who think they’re somehow superior to everyone else because they don’t have any erotic thoughts at all that are phucked ^. It’s not healthy. (It took me a fair time to get right mentally because of this unhealthy way of viewing the world. Thank god I had “active” friends to correct me before it was too late, and to reverse the damage of my bad parenting.) No wonder they need an instruction booklet on their honeymoon and freak out about it. And no, I still haven’t figured out how to use a Lelo bunny vibe, but I guess I don’t need to know. Anyway it’s all in fun. It’s not a dating agency it’s Silk Road. Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plenty.

				Great post Raz or are you really Dr Phil! (lol). C&#039;mon, fess up Dr Phil!! Some very clinical advice given here Raz.

A wide gamut of issues covered there Raz and as always, beautifully written.

I think something went wrong before birth. I&#039;m not saying this in fun. There are certain people who are men who are half woman, and certain women who are half man, if I remember correctly it has either something to do with a phucked ^ chromosome count, something to do with drinking too much beer, or both. Actually beer can contribute, so can chicken, but as these come after birth. Judge Judy I believe is possibly one of these walking monstrosities and I feel sorry for her as she is sick and needs help.

If you’ve got soft rope or some frilly cuffs we might be in for a good night lol. (Though this time I’ll try not to lose the key!! That killed the romance a bit lol! It had fallen out of my pocket when I got out of the car, looked EVERYwhere bedore finding it not to the amusement of my now ex.

				So I&#039;m a writer which by default means I&#039;m one of those lame ass douche bags that likes to go to Starbucks with my notebook and write in public. One of my favorite things to do when I hit a blank spot is to look around and fall in love with some girl there. I guess I just have an active imagination or something but it is so nice to just build a story around a stranger and imagine how the two of you could be together. I never say anything, I don&#039;t leer at them salvatiously, I just take a quick look and fill my mind with why they are there, what they are thinking. I imagine their vulnerabilities and how I could complement them with my strengths. <br /><br />Every now and then a conversation will take place and some flirting will be done but oddly enough I find the fantasy of falling in love for an instant more rewarding than taking a stranger home to be bedded. Talking someone out of their clothes has never been especially difficult for me but if I consummate the dream than all I&#039;m left with is a reality that pales to my voyeuristic imagination. <br /><br />But Judge Judy? She would be a tough one for me to fall in love with, even for a moment...

				Yes really!!&nbsp; Most of you have made it quite clear in this thread, my love of Judge Judy is waaaaaaay out there, abnormal, even fucked up for some. However, it&#039;s just the way I feel. To use one of her famous lines - &quot;Beauty fades but dumb is forever.&quot; Appearance and attraction are also important to me but the depth and diversity of an intelligent woman and her intuition are what attracts me the most to a lady.<br />Raz, I agree that there are in all probability, better woman out there. However, they don&#039;t have a T.V show where I can view the way they look, speak and interact with others. It&#039;s these points, and a few others, which allow me to form the opinion that Judge Judy rocks. She doesn&#039;t take shit from anyone!!

I should really buy more before I run out.<br /><br />As to this thread, hmm, Judge Judy is too rude, so it doesn&#039;t matter if she got game, she would never cut it with me. I like a bit of substance. She&#039;s just an ATT: seeker, little 72 year old child IMAHO.&nbsp; &gt;:(<br /><br />Princessssssss........ :) how are you?

				Listen I’m really tired of this bullshit. Not just last night but in general. I thought people would be a little open-minded about something. God. Was I wrong. I wrote it to contribute to, not denegrade, this thread. I’m tired of this teen girl habit of not dealing with a problem. I deserve better than that. I’m not a fucking pile of shit. <br /><br />After one of the worst nights ever since TS left without even a proper fucking goodbye, which incidentally fucked up today, I decided to re-post this fucking thing and let people get back to me. I have gone over it with a fine pick and the only fucking thing I could put my finger on was one goddamn line and it didn’t even make sense [edit.] anyone [edit] offended by that. <br /><br />And fuck PM, because I’m over it now. I’m too pissed to even check the goddamn inbox. You want to –K the fuck out of me for my “negative” tone to this post, be my fucking guest. It means nothing to me.<br /><br />[edit.]. The way it is, I just felt [edit.], and [edit.]times. So whatever. Have a great life. Oh, and people’s response to this? No. No, I really don’t give a shit at this stage but I’m curious, I’m curious, oh so fucking curious, as to see if they could help me out and tell me what the fuck was so punishable [edit.] about it. <br /><br />[edit.]a bit beyond that now.<br /><br />I only wanted to contribute, and maybe cheer people on this thread up. [edit.] I’m not a troll I’m a lover. When have I EVER put anyone down? What the fuck ever. What…………..the…………..fuck…………..ever.

				And fuck taking this down again. In fact, fuck anyone who has a problem with it. When the fuck have I ever trolled? WHEN? I&#039;ve never posted anything but positive contributions, or at least that was my intention, so what the fuck ever. I always stand up against trolls or scammers on this site. Some fucking reward.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96481.msg726006#msg726006">Quote from: Razorspyne on January 14, 2013, 08:31 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hmm, two ways of doing this..... but I don&#039;t want to stuff it ^. Stuff it, let me come back in a bit.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />BE RIGHT BACK...... &gt;:D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />WB. TY Twelve_Pickles (I think). Good to see you got a lol out of one of my posts; it’s too hard to change your style on the forums, I just write without censoring. (Unless it’s troll-like or reslly dirty) And yeah, it helps to be honest. It’s therapeutic; it’s a form of closure. Perhaps you could have left out the bit where you thought I was “a bit lonely and need to get laid”, though. What the phuc was THAT about! :o<br /><br />Where did ACE get to? No rave lasts 2 weeks….. I’m sure he didn’t move back in with his mum either, what with his opium operation, so give us a line if you see this dude. I’ll be the last one to scream “bust”, I’m sure it’s not that, it’s just a little eerie. (I’m sure it is not what I am thinking and that somewhere there has been a misunderstanding or some stuff ^ , but in all events get back to us) Can’t sell if not here….. <br /><br />Princesssssss!! RE TorChat, isn’t that anonymous? I think I was on it when I first discovered Tor and it kept coming ^ :<br /><br />Anonymous #1034: The proletariat in Cuba needs to re-align its fundamental democratic principles in order to reach any serious platform in the U.N. General Assembly.<br /><br />And I wrote:<br /><br />Anonymous #1035: Are you guys in Cuba?<br /><br />To which they replied:<br /><br />Anonymous #1036: Please refer to topic thread for information pertaining region of discussion.<br /><br />Which I thought was uncalled for. So I just wrote:<br /><br />Anonymous #1035: Good luck with your democracy thing.<br /><br />Signed out and never went back. Some people are unsociable. A simple, “Yes we are in Cuba” would have sufficed. I thought it was TorChat? I will look into it again when I’ve got time, but honestly I have no interest, so yeah, probably never. I would rather play with you guys (and Princess’s frilly cuffs). :P Lol, my original post had me, Ballz, modziw and Ahoyhoy tying you ^ but I thought, let’s not ruin this and erred on the side of caution, which is why you see a bunch of dots ….as I decided to delete it. But I’m glad you’re okay with us loving you on the forums, frankly it’s a turn on for everyone here. :D Hope you bump into a hot muffin at a party soon and have an interesting night you’ll remember all week, I have a nice, warm, hot feeling that you are easy to love. (I could be wrong of course. You could be a fuck-ugly 72 year old granny perving on youngsters for sick kicks but I THINK I know better.) [Shit I hope I didn’t ruin the mood in here with that….] :-\ Anyway, I made my mind ^ about you a while ago Princess, and I think most people here feel the same way, as evidenced in a recent thread. (Glad to see Ballz, Murder et al stand ^ for the little guy) :) Just a tip, try to involve some of your girlfriends in on the action if you get tied ^, or at least have someone in the house with you in case he turns out to be a real nasty piece of shit. You could do with me or Lim in your house to keep you company ;) ; I’d say Lim has slightly more chance as he lives closer your region. But if you had me, I’m cool with orgies, I won’t tell, I’m GREAAAAAT sharing in groups, and keeping secrets from neighbours and co-workers, only problem I have is I have been known to say funny things at the wrong moment, ::) ruining many would-have-been orgasms when they started laughing, and then as they realise what happened and how I inadvertently cheated them, got mad with me. It’s something I have been working on. (When you’re in the moment and someone makes a wisecrack you have to start all over again, and sometimes you run out of time. (We ended up late for class; teacher did not believe our “car broke down” bullshit story) I need to learn it’s not okay to do that.)&nbsp; :(<br /><br />Anyway you need not worry about taking sides; I’m sure we can all flirt with you at the same time and keep it civil on the threads without it turning into a jealousy thing. &gt;:D Don’t worry about us falling in love with you, we’re merely being polite. If I were you I would just sit back and enjoy it; bask in it for a while. :) I smile when I think of the other threads on encryption security and arrest advice…. they probably don’t realise how hot and sticky it gets on this thread. ::)<br /><br />But I still hope you bump into that stud muffin and soon, because you deserve to have those frilly cuffs used on you while a bunch of hot guys tie you to the bed (or couch if you prefer) and do really crazy things to you well into the night. ;) There are some of us who will say yes to any wish you can name (providing it’s you), and have no (or few) taboos, and are happy to spend a whole night with you doing just about anything your mind can come ^ with. :-X Just make sure it’s a Friday or Saturday so you can all sleep in and not worry about getting fired when no-show for work. (Another tip, don’t use rope or even kink in a new relationship/one night stand, you really have to trust a guy a lot before you do that, I hear Raz is unforgettable but others, use a little caution. Stay away from meatheads….. fortunately there are lots of guys who are tanked, well packaged, AND intelligent, they are a bit more rare but certainly thousands out there.)&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Anyway, enjoy this shit while it lasts, you’re top of the pops with all of us right now, and I hope you tingle every time you come online and read this thread ::) ; flirting is no substitute for us to come to your house and have a massive Silk Road orgy (everyone on SR invited! :P ) instead of just saying it, but when you are on SR what are you going to do lol. If I come to your country, I will detonate 45kg of C4 in the capital city of your choosing as a signal, and you will know it is me when it starts to rain concrete :D, and come out of your house holding 5 tabs Ecstasy and a pink halter top singing “RAZOR!!!” loudly to get my attention. ??? Or what do you suggest??! Bah! Forget it…… I can see this failing already. :&#039;(<br /><br />And I’ll stop with pushing the boundaries before it gets a little further and further and further and one day we’re openly talking about being Spanish on your chest or whipped cream enemas; sometimes people go too far and you might think, hmm, should’ve stayed on pine’s low-brow but safe PGP Club or whatever the phuc astor and Nightcrawler have going on there at the moment. ::)<br /><br />(I’m very tame on other threads; you wouldn’t recognise me. Very serious lol.)&nbsp; ???<br /><br />TY for your compliments Princess. I’m still basking in your afterglow…. Appreciate it. :) I’ve read some of your posts; some make me tingle and some make me stiffen and some make me smile and some make me feel upbeat….. but it is always a good effect, so keep it up toots. ;)<br /><br />Lol, you had no idea of your admirers on SR?&nbsp; :-* Aww. I think most of us are shy and don’t let on, but we are out there. 8) Good to hear you had time for your friend. She probably would’ve appreciated that, as well as a cuddle, a kiss on the forehead and cheek, and a little lay down with her on the bed for a bit over a stimulating chat and hot coffee. Nice to hear you didn’t say stiff shit monkey pit&nbsp; &gt;:( and leave her by herself. As for the guy who fell asleep on the toilet, he should probably cut back a bit. You really need your toilet! You can’t go on your bed!! I’ve seen similar things happen IRL at parties but not really the trend; this guy may need to lift his game a little. :-[<br /><br />As for the rest of you on SR, yeah, you’re good too I guess, never really thought about it. Didn’t realise there were people on this forum besides PrincessHIGH….&nbsp; ??? I’ll get around to you guys eventually, hang in there!<br /><br />A friendly pinch on the bottom to everyone reading this. :P Piece out. Drive safely. Eat plently.<br /><br />P.S. Wado, you should be ashamed….. absolutely unforgivable…… holy crap, there are way more people better looking than Judge Judy; chug some whey, pop some pills, heave some pipe, take a shower, chuff some powder, splat some anti-persp, slick up your hair (but don’t overdo it), find those sexy ripped jeans your mum keeps trying to throw out, clean your teeth (do this before sex as well, it opens up the olfactory and taste buds; you can smell more when going down and taste more when kissing, it’s a no-brainer), strut into your car, pop some cool beats on, Ministry of Sound if you have any, cruise down to the club, get out of the car, look around disdainfully, walk toward the bouncer like you’re thinking about beating the absolute living daylights out of him if he even looks at you funny while unhooking the rope, walk in like you own the place and take it from there, but yeah, generally speaking, you will find there are absolutely plenty of girls out there that will leave Judge Judy well and truly behind IMAHO; you just need to raise standards a fraction, I’m sure you will thank me on the night! :)<br /><br />ProudCannabian, would love to hear some tips from you on how to achieve that. 8 – 9 times in one night is quite good, a lot of men, even with very good rope levels, cannot achieve this. Very healthy mindset, well done. Know any tongue-strengthening exercises? You shall be my new god. 8) Well done. Good job. Your mum must be proud to have raised someone so sexually active and not lacking. Credit to her. Good job. No protein deficiencies here! Nice. Good stuff. Healthy eating! I have to credit that.<br /><br />Now I am well and truly out. Enjoy your jay or night everybody, bump into you guys later.<br /><br />[Hmm, what the phuc did Lim mean about that “I thought me and you had a thyng&quot; and what did you mean about that “a few p.ms” to Lim? ??? A FEW?? How long has this secret little thing been going on for? Should I be jealy….? Funny the weird things that “pop out” accidentally on the forums isn’t it Princess?] ::)<br /><br />Just kidding, don’t mind my ...teasing. Do whatever you want lol. Lim is Lim you is you and Raz is still here. Raz is still Raz. Raz is always ready to play! Raz always has time for Miss PM! ;)<br /><br />[Edit. Miss PM, found some more lingerie sites. Good ones. Lol, I had fun looking them ^. &gt;:D Will give addys.]<br />&nbsp;<br />[Edit. Lol Wado, your avatar looks like a bed being rhythmically pounded…. Look at it again…. See it? pmsl…. It just keeps moving up and down….&nbsp; :-X<br /><br />Also, Jesus H. Christ Wado, for someone with your background you’re not doing too well in the English department pmsl roflmfao!&nbsp; :o Per se, not per say….. Wado, you’re killing me here with your mistakes……… very funny though……. and cheap theatre] <br /><br />Another thing too, I hummed and harred about bringing back the Quote of the Day addendums; I discontinued it because I couldn’t find anything decent to put ^, but sometimes you see something and think, funny, or odd…… I might put that ^. Sometimes someone will say the dumbest thing and you look at it and think yes I can read it but it’s too stupid to dignify. It’s not funny in the least. But 20 seconds later you think…… what…..a…..fruit……and can’t stop. I’m going to put 1 or 2 ^ every now and then. Some will like it, some won’t, and some won’t care. That’s totally fine. They’re not supposed to be total riots, just smile makers and odd facts that come ^. Let me be me, and I will let you be you. <br /><br />Also, if someone else has something naughty to contribute to this thread don’t just lurk; if it’s not TOO personal, spill your guts, we want to hear about it. Especially if it involves drugs. Or a teacher. (Or things that are soooooooo wrong, lol)<br /><br /><br />(Soooo rolled over tonight. If I appear to change personalities (get silly) it&#039;s because I&#039;m tired. 2moz I&#039;ll be better. More serious I imagine. Right now though, not 2 worried.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Quote for today<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101029.msg707831#msg707831">Quote from: miraex on January 06, 2013, 10:24 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=101029.msg706199#msg706199">Quote from: Rocker on January 06, 2013, 03:36 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Feedback doesn&#039;t lie :)<br /><br />Much Love,<br /><br />Rocker<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />says the guy with 15 ghost accounts ....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Awww Raz don&#039;t every take your posts down why would you want to do that? It&#039;s refreshing to see someone who&#039;s as deeply expressive as you on this forum, you&#039;re intelligent, inspiring, kind, and funny at times, I enjoy you, keep up the great posts, and please carry on standing up to the trolls and scammers, there needs to be more people looking out for others here, I always try to too, and if you attract the &#039;affection&#039; of a moronic troll perhaps they&#039;re jealous that you&#039;re doing something right, fuck them, chin up, stand tall, and be proud of who you are.<br /><br />I hope ACE is okay, people come and go on this forum, sometimes real life issues take over and there&#039;s no time for this forum for one reason or another, don&#039;t worry he&#039;ll return when he&#039;s ready. As for TorChat I remember reading a thread that debated it&#039;s anonymity but I can&#039;t find it, this on the other hand http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=105803.msg725342#msg725342 I&#039;d avoid like the plague OP might have good intentions but downloading a program from someone you don&#039;t know rings warning bells. In regards to your cuba discussion on TorChat it&#039;s up to you how much information you divulge and to who, cuba is a small country and communist perhaps they got paranoid, cuba oppresses the internet but it&#039;s not illegal to run tor (clearwebalert) http://www.latentexistence.me.uk/the-internet-oppressive-regimes-and-tor/ however they might get you for it anyway because they&#039;re a law onto themselves.<br /><br />Raz rest assured it takes a lot to phase me, take a look at what I was watching last night (link in last post) if a guy came anywhere near me with that kind of equipment I&#039;d jump out the window and run like usain bolt, I&#039;m far too tight for those kinds of shenanigans and I want it to stay that way! However, I take my hat off to the girl she had balls. I&#039;m not a 72 year old granny, but that&#039;s anonymity for you, nobody knows who anybody is, if you read my posts enough it wouldn&#039;t be hard to profile my age group. In a perfect world, I&#039;d invite all of you around for party favours and a game of strip poker or better still strip twister, preferably with some baby oil to up the game! I enjoyed reading what you&#039;d have in store for me Raz, it was like reading fifty shades of grey but a lot more real, you should become a writer, you&#039;re clearly very talented in that department, or if you wanted to be more hands on a great porn director! Thank-you too for your sensible advice and looking out for me and all my admirers and friends I really appreciate it, I&#039;m sending a big hug to everyone out there and long may this awesome thread continue :-*<br /><br />P.S. Keep those quotes of the day coming Raz they&#039;re a great way to start the day :)

				Good to see you again Princess! :) Someone basically cracked a spaz over one of them once so I took it down and we&#039;ve been kind of ignoring each other since. If it wasn&#039;t you it wouldn&#039;t even have been a big deal anyway..... some people&#039;s opinions matter to me and others, can go to hell. Speaking of people I&#039;m down with, I looked at ACE&#039;s profile and it appears he&#039;s back, just not on our thread. I was a little worried when somebody said something about something, don&#039;t know if that is correct or not, but yeah he&#039;s back! :) (Pretty damn vague on Main, aren&#039;t I? My memory comes and goes, depending whether I&#039;m on PM or not lol ::) ) Sounds like he&#039;s had an issue or two to deal with, thanks to some knuckle-head, but he&#039;ll be fine, if a little busier. <br /><br />Wow, how do you find these things? Lol, I couldn&#039;t even find a damn picture of a cute muffin without running into porn! ??? I typed &quot;sex muffin&quot; into Google Images and all this other stuff came ^. Some of them looked nothing like muffins! ???&nbsp; :-\ I agree with not downloading .PRGs from a medium like this..... What they did in Egypt, according to the second link, is exactly why Tor is so bloody essential. It&#039;s basically what internet should be like, which is secure.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to look for your last link; from memory it was the girl with two vaginas. RE intruders/shits in street, hmm, I&#039;d feel a lot better if you had a shotgun, handgun, or even stun-gun on hand. Just remember, in a situation like that.......balls, balls, balls! Don&#039;t hold back.... <br /><br />Granny thing was supposed to be a joke, very stupid of me I suppose. I kind of figured you were not 72 years old. And yes, being a porn director has flitted through my mind once or twice! I love directing sex videos, if you can call them sex videos as opposed to us mucking around with the camcorder documenting our sex lives. Only, she has them now. &gt;:( Bah! Doesn&#039;t matter. (And as my &quot;other&quot; documentary DVD was soiled that&#039;s all I have left! I think it was potato juice or some crap :-\ ) There can only be one Ron Jeremy. Besides, I&#039;m more of a Girls Gone Wild kind of guy...... I like a little bit of imagination...... a see-through pair of knickers under an over-the-waist schoolgirl uniform does more for me than a full monty. (shit movie) TY for leaving me with some mental material to go to sleep with..... never even thought about strip twister with baby oil..... ooohhhh...... you&#039;re naughty........ ::) <br /><br />Thanks for being you, Miss PM. Appreciate the sentiments. I hope you never change. :) <br /><br />P.S. Yes, I wouldn&#039;t mind being hands-on in a porn video. I like the way you think! I&#039;m very euro...... ::) <br /><br />Enjoy the rest of your day Miss PM. :)<br /><br />&quot;Warning - while you were typing a new reply has been posted. You may wish to review your post.&quot;<br /><br />Cheers Twelve_Pickles..... I was certainly pissed today, sort of just came out. Anyway, haven&#039;t slept for 2 days so I&#039;m sooooo tired. Piece out everyone on Silk Road! Drive safely. Eat plenty.

				I don&#039;t know how I find them, I think they find me! A lot of &#039;muffin tops&#039; came up in my search, not my idea of a turn on but each to their own. If you want to be a porn director I&#039;d say go for it, it would be a waste of your talent if you didn&#039;t. Have you seen Orgazmo, ron jermery makes an appearance in it, it&#039;s hilarious and I think you&#039;d enjoy it. I&#039;ll sign this post off with a word of advice:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96481.msg729091#msg729091">Quote from: Razorspyne on January 15, 2013, 02:55 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Just remember, in a situation like that.......balls, balls, balls!

				i hope you dont find offence with this Raz as your a sensitive person but sometimes it helps to not take things to heart so much on an annonymous board. we all post things here that we care about and are sincere but we also troll, lol, rant,rave and genuinely act mental. but taking things down right to the heart of it, the core, discourse on a truely personal level. well thats new for the road.<br /><br />chin up kidda. smoke some weed and relax.<br /><br />you havent even said what drugs your into? wheres your stash at, and more importantly your head? <br /><br />namaste to all.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; P.S. Wado, you should be ashamed….. absolutely unforgivable…… holy crap, there are way more people better looking than Judge Judy; chug some whey, pop some pills, heave some pipe, take a shower, chuff some powder, splat some anti-persp, slick up your hair (but don’t overdo it), find those sexy ripped jeans your mum keeps trying to throw out, clean your teeth (do this before sex as well, it opens up the olfactory and taste buds; you can smell more when going down and taste more when kissing, it’s a no-brainer), strut into your car, pop some cool beats on, Ministry of Sound if you have any, cruise down to the club, get out of the car, look around disdainfully, walk toward the bouncer like you’re thinking about beating the absolute living daylights out of him if he even looks at you funny while unhooking the rope, walk in like you own the place and take it from there, but yeah, generally speaking, you will find there are absolutely plenty of girls out there that will leave Judge Judy well and truly behind IMAHO; you just need to raise standards a fraction, I’m sure you will thank me on the night! :)<br />&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Raz, I LOVE your posts sooooooo much! :) Fuck you make me laugh. ;) Just to clarify something, I think your missing my point about about Judge Judy. I was simply making the point that I look for some traits exhibited by Judge Judy in women I meet. I&#039;m not looking to fuck JJ as such, but a lady with intelligence, whit and a dry sense of humor are traits I look for and admire in a woman. The fact that she isn&#039;t afraid to speak her mind or argue with others about who&#039;s right or wrong is also appealing. I have been puffing on a pipe prior to writing this and ABSOLUTELY agree with you about there are MUCH better looking ladies in the world than Judge Judy. I won&#039;t be thinking about beating up any bouncers as I&#039;m a lover, not a fighter. Finding jeans my mum keeps trying to throw out isn&#039;t an issue for me Raz as I moved out of my parent&#039;s place decades ago. <br />I must say you have captured my imagination with regards to your &quot;movie&quot; directing aspirations. A porn director is something I didn&#039;t picture you being Raz. An author or journalist maybe, but a porn director never even crossed my mind. Hope you seriously consider taking up the challenge and giving it a go. With an imagination as vivid and vast as your, who knows what to expect from you. I envisage a story line encompassing some sort of love story featuring some raunchy, passionate, titillating sex scenes that will blow the viewers mind. And PrincessHIGH, the idea of a game of Strip Poker or even better, a game of Strip Twister when covered in baby oil just sounds fantastic! That would be a laugh a minute I&#039;m sure. Some great ideas by two of the most interesting and captivating ladies I&#039;ve had the pleasure of interacting with on this forum. The mind boggles......... ;) :)

				+1 for you too TP. This thread is just some fun and dickheads like the goat herder should post else where. In fact Daniel, there&#039;s a saying - &quot;It&#039;s nice to be important but it&#039;s more important to be nice&quot;.

I&#039;ll get around to men after I finish with women, time is becoming scarce as January rolls on :-\&nbsp; As to Ron Jeremy on Orgazmo, I must have missed that lol, no British muffin TV, that;s okay though...... As to balls, balls, balls, ensure you have full ones as it would be very draining on your resources if you didn&#039;t, yes I do have full balls plenty of juice to go around without being a drain on my resources, thanks for asking (God Princess, what made you ask that lol :o Even by my standards that is cheeky!)

Like I said, some people I don&#039;t mind and naturally give a damn about their opinion; others, couldn&#039;t care less. Princess falls into the first category, along with a couple others on Silk Road and Silk Road forums. Whether I give a rat&#039;s testicle depends on what sort of a person they are. Some of the most sincere people (or at least, in the top 50) I&#039;ve met are right here on The Road. I&#039;m not one to treat everyone the same. I think if you meet someone half decent, remember that&#039;s a rare thing. So yes, of course I care what these people think. Whether I help someone out of a burning car depends on what sort of a person they are. If I saw that person murder someone without a good reason (self-defense for instance) and the car ran into a tree in front of me, and I&#039;m the only one who can save him...... well, I guess he&#039;s shit out of luck. There are too many shits in this world to grant them in-expendable status in that kind of situation. You got to appreciate the good ones because not only are they rare but when they go they go. That already happened to 2 people already on Silk Road. It&#039;s not going to happen again. <br /><br />As for BiB, well......... I hope they get sexually assaulted so they actually know what it feels like. How the phuc dare they defend people who have molested children by saying a little suffering on the part of a child is forgivable because at least their molester keep their bodies clean by not doing drugs. How the phuc dare they...... (I hit everyone on that page who felt something over this with K, I was proud of our community that had a reaction and said that was not okay.)<br /><br />Crap.

Take my word for it, you won&#039;t find a sample review under the name &quot;Razorspyne&quot;, and the same with everyone else on here I presume. But you have probably figured out from convos that a lot of people on here. You really think everyone reviews on their regular name? Actually, some do. Should of thought of that before typing. :-\ Yeah, okay, some do, a lot don&#039;t. There are a lot of &quot;quiet&quot; members on SR that are like that for a reason..... power to them.

				Raz, I&#039;m not mad at all! There&#039;s nothing to be mad about. I probably didn&#039;t word my post too well and perhaps came across a little short in my response. Sorry for that as that wasn&#039;t my intention. I don&#039;t have any emoticons to add to my posts at the moment. It&#039;s been that way for my last 6-8 posts now. Might log out and then log back in and see what happens.<br />Raz, you have been a little picky lately with certain things. I noticed you had a dig at a spelling mistake I made with &quot;per se&quot; instead of it being &quot;per say&quot;. You have to factor in a level of tolerance for people such as myself who may have over indulged insome potent gear. I would like to point out a boo boo which you continue to make just to even the score at 1all. When you sign out at the end of your posts, you write Piece out, drive safely and eat plenty. The piece should be peace as piece is used for a piece of paper.<br />Raz, from my point of view, there is no issue with anything, nor has there ever been. My opinion of you is the same it has always been so I hope you feel that way too. We might of got our wires crossed at some stage but I hope things get back to the way they were. Truthfully, how did all this bullshit begin anyway? Fucked if I know anything anymore, time for a little shut eye. Till next time........&nbsp; &nbsp;

Does each one have it&#039;s own individual cycle or what? When it rains it pours?&nbsp; Does it effect your breathing while wearing a tampon in one of the under arm vaginas?&nbsp; Does it limit your arm movement? Do you masterbate when giving yourself a hug?&nbsp; You ever had all 5 holes penetrated at the same time? I bet guys and gals are constantly trying to lick your arm pits. <br /><br />And my last question from the top of my head is do you shave your arm pits or do you have that Madonna hairy arm pit thing going like where you look like you got butwheat in a head lock?<br /><br />Just curious inquiring minds want to know

There&#039;s nothing to be mad about. I probably didn&#039;t word my post too well and perhaps came across a little short in my response. Sorry for that as that wasn&#039;t my intention. I don&#039;t have any emoticons to add to my posts at the moment. It&#039;s been that way for my last 6-8 posts now. Might log out and then log back in and see what happens.<br />Raz, you have been a little picky lately with certain things. I noticed you had a dig at a spelling mistake I made with &quot;per se&quot; instead of it being &quot;per say&quot;. You have to factor in a level of tolerance for people such as myself who may have over indulged insome potent gear. I would like to point out a boo boo which you continue to make just to even the score at 1all. When you sign out at the end of your posts, you write Piece out, drive safely and eat plenty. The piece should be peace as piece is used for a piece of paper.<br />Raz, from my point of view, there is no issue with anything, nor has there ever been. My opinion of you is the same it has always been so I hope you feel that way too. We might of got our wires crossed at some stage but I hope things get back to the way they were. Truthfully, how did all this bullshit begin anyway? Fucked if I know anything anymore, time for a little shut eye. Till next time........ <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wado :) couldn&#039;t answer that as I was flirting with word limit. Lol, again as per last night, I tease and crack a lot I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve noticed! Picky? Who, me? Lol, just having a crack here, nothing too serious. I&#039;m aware some of you are french-kissing bongs right now and farting cocaine according to ONE odd post I saw yesterday :o , still, I got all the tolerance for you guys but I can&#039;t resist slapping you forum members on the ass and then running around the corner to hide like a juvenile fuck. That&#039;s just Raz being Raz as opposed to being genuinely upset over the fact you wrote yogurt instead of yoghurt ....... (YOU FUCK!! Spell-check should have picked that ^&nbsp; :o :o :o ) ....... getting back, I have only had my period on the forums once, and that was the other day when I hadn&#039;t slept and a couple of other things I need not expound here. Besides, I&#039;m back on the pill. I&#039;m fine from here on out. :)<br /><br />Um. What the phuc Wad. Ooohh...... did you just say Raz spelt something wrong? ??? [Edit. Sorry, I just got it. Phuc, Wad... fuck-wad lol, sorry I just got it&nbsp; :D ] Back on track, hang on what do you mean by peace not piece.... Usually it is spelled &quot;peace&quot; granted, but there was this odd quote I came across once that said in part, &quot;Oooohhhhh, that&#039;s a B-I-G organ....... ay, Carl? Ba ha ha....... Look, peace man.... a piece here.... a piece there.... Ba ha ha.....&quot; It&#039;s taken from that. I wrote it incorrectly the first time I was on BMR and I let it stick because of the quote, besides, it&#039;s charming I presume. ;) Or maybe not, I don&#039;t really care, it&#039;s just one of the many individual writing mannerisms I have. Everybody is the same, we have a propensity to make mistakes..... I just do it on purpose, it lends a little individuality.<br /><br />pmsl.... piece as in piece of paper.....Good phucking grief.... (See, you there you go, another &quot;mistake&quot; I make with phuc instead of fuck.....again at BMR, when I started I didn&#039;t want to say fuck b/c I thought I&#039;d be booted...... yeah, that&#039;s what they used to do in some chat-rooms..... it was sTuPdGrL if I remember, which I do, that had that quirk. Anyway.... Piece out, Wado! :)

No thunderstorms as yet, but with bush fires raging right across the country, we could sure do with some rain. :(<br />I can&#039;t think of anything on this planet which one could use to make a brussel sprout taste &quot;so much better!!&quot; (lol) ???

				So this is probably pretty unrelated but I just realized that cybersex would probably be a lot more fun on acid if you could avoid getting distracted by all the pretty colors...<br /><br />I just don&#039;t get why they haven&#039;t invented a way for me to jump into my virtual reality suit and have sex with buxom Asian leprechauns like every red blooded male wants to do. I mean we keep making cell phones smaller, cars run on batteries now, my tv is bigger than my living room and yet good virtual sex still requires me to call Asian Massage Parlors in Ireland and simply listen to a leprechaun describe what she&#039;s willing to do to protect her pot of gold as I stare longingly at my box of Lucky Charms.

				You would have to be a customer of mine first for such a thing, and as a customer of mine you would completely love everything I do and be willing to pay full price no matter what. This is just how it is, check my vendor page or forum review thread if you are curious and want to be sure. At that point, you would have no choice but to be my next customer.

You would take standard egg-shaped bullet vibes, and connect them to a DIY USB interface, and you connect over Tor to a modified Jabber server using free and open source client software. You connect to a vibrator session using an extended but well-documented Jingle protocol that makes use of Tor Hidden Services similar to Torchat, and can thereby send literal &quot;positive vibes&quot; to people over the Internet via Tor.<br /><br />That sounds like a really fun project, actually.<br /><br />I could do it all in Python.<br /><br />Github does not seem to block tor exit nodes, so we could register an account on Github, and begin a FOSS repository there.<br /><br />Anyone interested in assisting me with this?<br /><br />If clearnet Github is unsatisfactory, give me a few months, and I&#039;ll host my own gitweb server (similar to Gitorious) over Tor, which makes it 100% Darknet.<br /><br />Anyone interested?<br /><br />I could set up a chain of deals with known and trusted vendors to sell plenty of egg-shaped bullet vibes and pre-constructed USB interfaces for them.<br /><br />Anyone interested in this?

				So the weirdest sexual thing that&#039;s happened with me lately is I keep having it with my girlfriend.<br /><br />Normally we are sex camels... we love each other and all but the actual sex doesn&#039;t normally happen all that often.<br /><br />Ever since we started doing drugs together we talk all the time, say nice things about each other and then end up shagging like mad for weeks after the high is gone.<br /><br />The other day I was watching a little porn, getting myself off as usual... and all of the sudden I started thinking about my girlfriend.<br /><br />I mean I&#039;ve lived my whole life hearing drugs are bad and all but I never really believed it until that moment. My girlfriend has become my sexual fantasy. I eat her out for hours on end. I do the dishes for her so she can just come home and relax after working all day. She comes in when I&#039;m working and I stop what I&#039;m doing and look at her with loving appreciation. <br /><br />I think no one really appreciates that if we take these drugs and have our good times that there are going to be consequences but I am living proof. So next time you are sitting around with a pill to pop or a line to snort you really should ask yourself &quot;Do I want to risk being more open and happy with the person I am going to share this experience with? Do I want to find myself liking someone more just because of the fact that our shared drug use allows us to explore new and fascinating aspects of each other that might lead to increased bonding?&quot;<br /><br />Sure, drugs sound like a lot of fun at first but eventually you have to start dealing with the consequences...

Me and my girlfriend were great before drugs and I just love the fact that now that we get to trip from time to time it seems to make us even better. Those long nights lost on E are just a blast for us. If anyone else saw us they would think we are just retarded but being able to spend hours lost in love with someone you adore is worth any cost of admission for me.<br /><br />The weight loss thing is awesome. I&#039;m a big guy but I&#039;ve dropped like 15 pounds or so since we started. Plus now that I&#039;m all insane in love with my girlfriend I sort of feel motivated to eat healthier and get a little fitter. I really can&#039;t imagine any doctor prescribed treatment for depression / getting older could beat just spending a few hours a month on drugs with someone you worship.<br /><br />Glad I&#039;m not alone on the drugs are good for couples thing. Seems so odd that over the course of a few months and a few trips I&#039;m been able to tap into even more feelings for a girl I was already heads over heels for.

				All right TrashBox, here&#039;s my official guide to drugging friends:<br /><br />1. Tell everyone that they are going to love the drug.<br />2. Let everyone know that sometimes on the come up or down people can get a little nauseous and that&#039;s okay. After a quick purge life will be fine.<br />3. Let everyone know that sometimes on the come up or down people can get a little sweaty and that&#039;s okay. This normally comes right before the nauseous and having a cool room / spot helps a lot.<br />4. Try to encourage everyone to skip dinner if they can and dose at the same time. Part of the fun with E is having everyone in the same place at the same time and an empty stomach helps.<br />5. I wouldn&#039;t worry too much about varying the dose by weight / sex. I know it&#039;s counter intuitive but it&#039;s been my experience that most people roll pretty good the first time off 120-150mg regardless of size.<br />6. If the space accommodates it, have a room with some music and a quiet room. Some people love music when high and for others it can be a little overwhelming.<br />7. Figure out a bump strategy in advance. Almost every issue people have with MDMA comes from badly planed bumps. The general rule is 50% dose at one hour in. My girlfriend and I often do full redose at about 1.5 - 2 hours. YMMV.<br />8. Weed is great but I would avoid it during the roll and just use some for the come down. MDMA is a beautiful drug and if it&#039;s their first time you should just let them roll pure and clean. This means keep the booze hidden too until later at least!<br />9. The more toys the better. I love those little spider head massagers on E. Vic&#039;s is pretty awesome. Lotion as mentioned before. Bath time is especially nice too but it&#039;s gonna be hard to get people out once they get in. <br />10. Not to be a total downer but if at all possible it would be nice if there was one person at the party that could stay sober and mostly out of the way. Giving a bunch of friends drugs is awesome fun but people are stupid on drugs and if anyone has any problems it&#039;s nice to have a lifeline to get a little help. Never been an issue, probably never will be, but you know where I&#039;m coming from. <br /><br />Other than that have fun. I saw you asked about lithium in another thread which is important. I ALWAYS make sure no one is on SSRI&#039;s too which is a bitch because people don&#039;t like to admit to them. The good news is the anti-depresent folks won&#039;t die or anything, they just won&#039;t roll very hard if at all.<br /><br />Make sure to let us know how it goes. We&#039;re going to need all the details since we are living vicariously through you!

				Diamond, you always make me so happy&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />I will take all your points into consideration and let you know all about it on Monday :) I do have one friend who is on the fence about trying it. I think he is self conscious and won&#039;t try it bc he is afraid of sharing too many feelings around all of his buddies. He&#039;s done a fuck ton of other drugs so I want him to try it... I keep telling him it will change his life. He keeps asking me what happened to my live and let live philosophy. So odds are there will be a sober dude at my party&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />I plan on a ceremonial toast so everyone rolls together GAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SO EXCITED!!!!!!!<br /><br />And, yes, my girlfriend on lithium is opting out. <br /><br />

				We&#039;re here for you. I have girlfriend that I really want to have come over and drop E with my girl and I but she is totally scared of the stuff. The war on drugs is already stupid enough but when it starts getting in the way of my drug induced threesomes it really aggravates me!<br /><br />I think anyone who could live one minute on a roll would immediately sign up for the other couple of hours but talking them into it can be a pain with all the crap they have heard. Maybe just take him aside, look him in the eyes and say &quot;If you don&#039;t do this everyone is going to think you are really, really gay.&quot; Peer pressure and drugs have a long relationship with each other.<br /><br />Oh, totally forgot the one other thing for the party roll, get some Magnesium Chelate if you can. I never get the clenchies but my girl gets them like mad when we drop. The regular magnesium sucks but for some reason the&nbsp; magnesium chelate takes the jaw tension down by a huge factor. I had to go to the Vitamin Shoppe to get some, GNC and WalGreens just had magnesium oxide which wasn&#039;t great. Like $6 bucks for a bottle and might keep a few people from loving life while they eat their face off.

You must be heaven-sent to cast some light in this sea of repressed adolescence i note on this thread - and i havenet even left the first page! <br />In order to better serve this answer, i went to SR to see for myself this sexy haiku but could find little on the good doctor. Perhaps a link to the erotic trigger might help juice up this discussion, but I shall try to throw out some nouns and syllables and shit and see if some sticks. In a reverse cowgirl so all the BTC in the world is before your eyes as you get fucked... Now here it gets fork-in-the-roadish:<br /><br />Is it getting fucked with you a whimpering.. &quot;Oh, we really shouldn&#039;t... you&#039;re not going to really do that to me, are you, doctor? You whimper about how it&#039;s too big, and it ill never fit... but he spanks you again and again, and the shame of it is youre getting wetter....&nbsp; and what of your husband? He&#039;s right there watching!!!<br /><br />or is it more, I am pussy-empowered. It feels great, and this sex is improving my world in various ways, and thus the BTC I am aware of represents more than money, it is all the chemicals in the SR world; potentially all of life&#039;s excitement and experiences...<br /><br />Trashbox, does this resonate in ANY way?<br />cj

I swear at that exact moment the other girl started to feel nauseous and so the 3 of us retired to the bathroom for the rest of the night.

That nauseous thing sucks a little but the best part about E is it normally doesn&#039;t bother the person feeling it too much. It&#039;s pretty well super hard / impossible to have MDMA on hand and not want to redose to prolong the magic though. Now that you are getting them all turned on to the MDMA train though you can chat with those that had a tummy issue and see if they want to try plugging it next time. My girl gets queasy more than I do but has never gotten so on plugging. If it was mostly the girls I think it would be an easy sell.<br /><br />I think you&#039;re all set for the next go around. Maybe you can make it a monthly / bimonthly thing for a while. You just always have to make sure to have more new folks come over... that shared high from people&#039;s first time is just fucking incredible.<br /><br />Hopefully you got to make out with someone at least a little. I swear there really isn&#039;t much better in the world then making out on E. It&#039;s like what every kiss ever wants to be but just can&#039;t quite get to.<br /><br />I&#039;m just four days away from my Drugimoon now... I&#039;ve got some MDMA, Moxy, MDA, Acid, Shrooms, GHB, Good Pot and Xanax in my supply kit. Going to try the Moxy first since it&#039;s supposed to be a little more erotic than the rest and go from there. Doubt we&#039;ll do anywhere near all of the stuff but figure we have enough to mix and match as the mood fits.&nbsp; <br /><br />If I don&#039;t post anything after Friday just know, we went out doing what we love!

				Only a couple days away now Diamond :)<br />I actually mentioned the plugging thing to the girls late that night when were discussing the roll. They werent into it. Oh well... I do it!<br /><br />The girls being nauseous wasn&#039;t the only reason it stayed pg... There was one guy that won&#039;t be invited next time. He started out the night by telling this fucked up story about how he had sex with this girl and kicked her out right afterward bc she shit the bed after he put it in her ass. The girls decided to avoid him after that. He was also giving play by plays of how he was feelIng and that got so annoying. We&#039;re all on the same stuff, shut up.&nbsp; He also walked in on the girls while we were changing (on purpose) and then went and bragged to the rest of the group that he saw A in a thong. <br />

Some people just don&#039;t get the vibe even when it&#039;s medically installed in them. My favorite part of an MDMA roll is that everyone just sort of gets everyone else. It&#039;s fun to chase with some 2CB on the tail end for the visuals because the empathy is still there but you get some crazy shit happening visually. Me and my girl were watching The Incredibles on a 2CB chaser and it&#039;s fun to share those connections where you&#039;re like &quot;What the fuck is happening on the screen?&quot; and we both just break up laughing. <br /><br />By the way, can I just give a big shout out to Pixar for basically being in the business of creating movies that are awesome to watch while on drugs?<br /><br />Maybe to mix it up next time you try it start off with the MDMA and then chase with MDA when you all are ready for a bump and see how that goes. I love the visuals on MDMA, gets me the eye wiggles like nothing else can but it is way harder on the come up so the queasy need to be careful. If you get rid of the loosers and keep the fun people you could end up being the Goddess of Parties for everyone in town!<br /><br />Separate note, just tried Moxy for the first time the other night (I like to test stuff before I put it in my girlfriend, have issues with poisoning her and all), and it&#039;s a different sort of trip you might want to check out sometime for a little bedroom fun. 6-8mg gets a nice little body buzz and it&#039;s real easy to find reasons to get horny. Not to get to painfully graphic but I got off about 5 times in a couple of hours on the stuff so... yeah, it&#039;s kind of neat. It&#039;s got a bit of a stim load to it, can feel it in your chest a little, but nothing overwhelming. I know you like new adventures so just thought I&#039;d toss it out there for you. Higher doses get visual which you might like but the low doses are like a little tickle in the crotch while staying in pretty good control of things.

Seems weird though to be on a drug forum where people will talk about super heating a glass tube to hotrail meth into their brain but essentially taking a suppository is still taboo. The one thing I have noticed is that 90% of the people are offended by the entire concept.... until they try it and then they are like, fuck, that was easy and I&#039;m really freaking high now.<br /><br />Have fun with the Moxy. Not that it&#039;s the best way to go about doing things but the dose curve on the stuff is really sharp so you want to be careful. My scale and I still haven&#039;t come to terms with .001 measurements even though it&#039;s supposed to be great at it so I&#039;ve been using a 1-3 mg scoop (think plastic spoon with a VERY tiny scoop at the end). If you are going to be feeling it out try to get to about 6mg and hang out there for at least an hour before you bump 2-4mg more. By the end of my trials I had taken in about 15mg and things had started getting a little visual but only just slightly. It makes me think my go to dose would be about 10-12mg by the time I factor in the halflife of my previous doses over the hours I played with it.

				I blame Trashbox for the high post count, she adds just enough kinkiness to keep people coming back for more. I suspect we are all hoping that she will eventually confess to be our neighbor and that she wants nothing more than to get really high with us and see where things go.

				Eh, I understand the point now, it&#039;s pretty much a &quot;Sex and Drugs&quot; thread with a catchy title. It also has a lot of flame war material, and who doesn&#039;t like a good dose of heavy bickering to go along with their drugs?! Carry on. <br /><br />

				Sorry I haven&#039;t contributed for awhile, I&#039;ve been suffering with writers block, it hasn&#039;t happened for years I&#039;m happy to say it&#039;s over. I had a good holiday, didn&#039;t have any sexy shenanigans, it was more about me sitting high on top of a mountain, reflecting and meditating, I did get drunk quite a few times too and almost drove off a cliff one night, fortunately I&#039;m real good at three point turns in tight places! I&#039;ve learnt my lesson never drive through nature trails in foreign countries in the dark, it doesn&#039;t end well! On the plus side I smuggled back some huge T-Bone steaks (for £3 a steak I couldn&#039;t say no!) they&#039;ve been marinating in a big bowl of Jim Bean since, the steaks have been adsorbing alcohol like a sponge, I&#039;ve been topping up their thirsts regularly, they&#039;ve drunk nearly half a bottle already pissheads lol! I&#039;m going to be so drunk tonight! I&#039;ve got some of La Funete&#039;s to sober me up for desert, I&#039;m smoking a couple of joints now to build up my appetite, it&#039;s my friday highday :) Just looking over the past couple of pages, I&#039;m happy to hear you had a great party TrashBox, hope those guys didn&#039;t overstretch or break your clothes and lingerie, even lycra has it&#039;s limits lol! I share a lot of time with my girlfriends in the bathroom too at parties when things get hectic it&#039;s our friendly female place, however what seems like half an hour turns into half the night, I swear bathrooms turn into secret time machines at parties lol, it&#039;s crazy how fast time flies! Poor high and dry guy lol, I hope he got drink instead. I read your announcement you&#039;ve joined forces with FuckingACE I wish you all the best with your new venture :)

				Since when is SEX an inane topic?<br /><br />Anyway, PRIN! HAPPY FRIDAY HIGH DAY!!! Me and you would be good friends IRL. A mountain top is my ideal setting for basically any drug. I love you more and more every time you come around :) There&#039;s so much we have in common. And, yes, those precious moments of female bathroom bonding on mdma is just another reason I am so grateful for SR. <br /><br />How is my MR.PLUGS on this FINE Druggiemoon Eve? I can&#039;t wait to hear all the details :)<br /><br />And for anyone who hasn&#039;t heard I&#039;ll C&amp;P:<br />Hi LOVESSSSSSS!<br /><br />It’s me, TrashBox, and I’m proud to announce I’ve joined the Scurvy Crew!<br /><br />Ace is very busy these days and can’t be around as much as he’d like, so I’ll be here to keep everyone informed of the goings ons of TSC. Most of the time I’ll post from my TrashBox account but if I post here I’ll sign TB. Also, messages sent to this account will be checked by me unless you type ACE ONLY in the subject line.<br /><br />FYI to my fellow Americans: TSC will soon be shipping our yummy hash domestically! That means no customs and even FASTER shipping. Be excited, my friends<br /><br />Theme song for my weekend: &quot;No Church In The Wild&quot; JayZ&nbsp; www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJt7gNi3Nr4<br /><br />XOXO TB&nbsp; <br /><br />

				Congrats on the new venture! Can&#039;t wait to find out what goodies we can get locally now. If you have any sway with the ACE tell him he needs to find us some yummy MDA so we can deal with ILF&#039;s occasional shortages.<br /><br />Supper excited for the big day. Getting dressed and walking out the door in about 5 minutes. I have a giant bag of drugs and a girl I love who wants to do em all with me, what could be better?<br /><br />I&#039;ll check back in Sunday unless today and tomorrow get lost somewhere in the a fore mentioned bag of drugs.<br /><br />Love all!

Fucking a dude or fucking a girl who is more aggressive and dominant than you, well both of those make you a complete homosexual.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not sure if serious....<br /><br />First of all, the concept of there being a very clear boolean true/false value for &quot;homosexual/not-homosexual&quot; is a very very flawed concept, and does not correlate with reality.<br /><br />The truth is, the vast majority of the biggest pseudo-masculine personas out there are lying to themselves and others and trying to hide their love of the cock.<br /><br />Secondly, gender (and orientation, which relies on a concept of gender) is very very fluid, and usually preferences turn out to rely on things unrelated to sex or gender.<br /><br />For example, many guys love jiggling boobies. The more jiggly and round, the better. Some like nestling into them like a huge comfortable pillow, or suckling the nipples. Freud would have entire dissertations to say on that subject if he had lived long enough to get around to it.<br /><br />Thirdly, all people who live in industrialized nations have had things like tubes and thermometers shoved up their butts, even if they were too young to remember it. The frantic rejection to the concept of plugging is very silly, because all it does is highlight how insecure they are. Real men plug.<br /><br />Fourthly, people who inject drugs directly into their veins, and spend all that money on needles, rubber bands, cotton balls, and bandages are being ridiculous, when you can plug for a tiny fraction of the cost, for a tiny penalty of at most 2% less bioavailabiltiy. If you really want to spend that much on a slightly faster comeup, that&#039;s fine, but if it&#039;s an argument based on bioavailability, the cost-effectiveness is clearly in favor of plugging.<br /><br />On the subject of dominance and submission determining your gender, I&#039;ve been advocating a long time for the abolishment of gender stereotypes, and using dominance and submission as the new social roles to replace gender. You can be male, or female, but whether you are dominant or submissive is a completely separate variable.<br /><br />Submissive males are very common in reality, and a lot of times, unless you are extremely submissive, or extremely dominant, it simply doesn&#039;t outwardly show until you slam a submissive against a wall and grope them. If they whimper and bare their neck, without making any move to stop you from groping them, that gives you an answer.<br /><br />If you try to slam someone against a wall, and end up getting pinned down yourself, that also gives you an answer.<br /><br />The times are changing, and many false assumptions about the reality of human nature, and people who seek the truth and reveal it are discarding the cultural mores and social norms forced down upon us from the self-hating elites who own us.<br /><br />One day, with the aid of onion routing, decentralized digital currencies, private information retrieval, assassination markets, black stock markets, entire cultures and economies completely independent and liberated from the elites&#039; hegemony over us will destroy gender stereotypes, perhaps even discarding the concept of gender completely.<br /><br />This is a day to which I am looking forward.

Fucking a dude or fucking a girl who is more aggressive and dominant than you, well both of those make you a complete homosexual.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not sure if serious....<br /><br />First of all, the concept of there being a very clear boolean true/false value for &quot;homosexual/not-homosexual&quot; is a very very flawed concept, and does not correlate with reality.<br /><br />The truth is, the vast majority of the biggest pseudo-masculine personas out there are lying to themselves and others and trying to hide their love of the cock.<br /><br />Secondly, gender (and orientation, which relies on a concept of gender) is very very fluid, and usually preferences turn out to rely on things unrelated to sex or gender.<br /><br />For example, many guys love jiggling boobies. The more jiggly and round, the better. Some like nestling into them like a huge comfortable pillow, or suckling the nipples. Freud would have entire dissertations to say on that subject if he had lived long enough to get around to it.<br /><br />Thirdly, all people who live in industrialized nations have had things like tubes and thermometers shoved up their butts, even if they were too young to remember it. The frantic rejection to the concept of plugging is very silly, because all it does is highlight how insecure they are. Real men plug.<br /><br />Fourthly, people who inject drugs directly into their veins, and spend all that money on needles, rubber bands, cotton balls, and bandages are being ridiculous, when you can plug for a tiny fraction of the cost, for a tiny penalty of at most 2% less bioavailabiltiy. If you really want to spend that much on a slightly faster comeup, that&#039;s fine, but if it&#039;s an argument based on bioavailability, the cost-effectiveness is clearly in favor of plugging.<br /><br />On the subject of dominance and submission determining your gender, I&#039;ve been advocating a long time for the abolishment of gender stereotypes, and using dominance and submission as the new social roles to replace gender. You can be male, or female, but whether you are dominant or submissive is a completely separate variable.<br /><br />Submissive males are very common in reality, and a lot of times, unless you are extremely submissive, or extremely dominant, it simply doesn&#039;t outwardly show until you slam a submissive against a wall and grope them. If they whimper and bare their neck, without making any move to stop you from groping them, that gives you an answer.<br /><br />If you try to slam someone against a wall, and end up getting pinned down yourself, that also gives you an answer.<br /><br />The times are changing, and many false assumptions about the reality of human nature, and people who seek the truth and reveal it are discarding the cultural mores and social norms forced down upon us from the self-hating elites who own us.<br /><br />One day, with the aid of onion routing, decentralized digital currencies, private information retrieval, assassination markets, black stock markets, entire cultures and economies completely independent and liberated from the elites&#039; hegemony over us will destroy gender stereotypes, perhaps even discarding the concept of gender completely.<br /><br />This is a day to which I am looking forward.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If you can&#039;t respect my stance, then yours is equally as flawed.

Sorry for my derogatory comments... again, I don&#039;t even agree with my drunken self, I think I was just looking to argue with someone.

				No, it will largely be an experiment in adding new FWBs to the book, a few of them I&#039;ll probably hit up on bad nights. <br /><br />I like to go out on the town, but finding women out on the town is not where I excel. Online dating is where it&#039;s at for me. I tend to thrive in an online environment. I would prefer being one out of a hundred dudes after a girl online, than to be one out of 5 dudes after a girl in a bar. About three months ago, when I was actively online dating... I decided to try to see how many different women I could have sex with in a row, a different one each day. I reached 7 before finally my body demanded a break. During this period of time, while I was online, it was pretty much unheard of for me not to have sex 6 or 7 nights a week. Now that I&#039;m offline, I haven&#039;t had sex in a couple weeks... if that sounds bipolar to you, well it is! The good news is, I&#039;m about to go back on the ride up! YIPEE!!!

				Holy shit, purple, a new one 7 days a week! I had no idea online dating was so... Lucrative!<br /><br />I have a friend I have been trying to convince to try online dating. He says he doesn&#039;t believe in it (whatever the fuck that means, his words). He is great one-on-one, but he is a complete slob in social situations... To the point where his close friends use his last name as a synonym for awkward. Bottom line, tho, he needs to get laid, so maybe if I tell him your experience he&#039;ll change his mind a bit.

You should probably make time to hit the gym (again another challenge). And no matter anyone ever tells you... ever... size does matter. Fuck all that motion in the boat talk, we have less room to work with so it has nothing to do with how we work it, we are working with less room and still crushing it, so it really isn&#039;t about motion at all... it&#039;s size.

Fuck Viagra... every man I know is familiar with that. This is SilkRoad where we are familiar with drugs unknown to most people. Cabergoline is still my favorite sex drug, it enables men to have multiple orgasms or just go for round 2 in a lot less time. Honestly though, it&#039;s a combination of drugs, as is everything I do. I&#039;m only on alcohol right now, but that&#039;s because I only have one more day to drink, so I&#039;m soaking it up!

				It&#039;s a substance used to reduce prolactin, which in women enhances breast tissue production and is naturally produced, so it is used for women with breast cancer to reduce the growth of any breast tissue including the cancer. In Men, prolactin is the chemical released when you have an orgasm that makes you flaccid after you orgasm.&nbsp; So by eliminating prolactin, you can eliminate the flaccid effect that comes (cums) with an orgasm.

				I have had two clear net research chemicals which completely lived up to the reputation, but one in pill form, which was from like china or some shit and I still have it sitting here with no use to it. The form of which I am saying does not work can be found in this listing:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/item/92bf517e77<br /><br />If it looks like that, my opinion is that it&#039;s shit. Although I certainly did not buy from this seller on SR, it&#039;s a clearnet product I came across in this exact same package. It&#039;s a great drug in my opinion if you can find a legit supply, it&#039;s often counterfeited.

				In&nbsp; unrelated news, I am less than one month away from final perfection of my Sex Torture Blend, a combination of specific ratios and doses of drugs in order to push the human body to it&#039;s sexual performance limit.<br /><br />Warning: You will terrify your peers with the sheer volume of your projectile semen ejaculation.<br /><br />It&#039;s only one month away from completion. I&#039;m still deciding whether to sell the finished blend for profit, or to just publish the recipe&nbsp; here for all your sexual torture needs.<br /><br />Second Warning: The blend will prevent you from achieving orgasm for days before releasing it all at once in an intimidatingly impressive fountain. You need to set a few days aside for torturing your partner or yourself.<br /><br />This blend will work on males or females, although originally intended for males, it will cause any intact female to squirt uncontrollably during the later phases of the drug blend&#039;s metabolism.<br /><br />Third Warning: If you have a weak mind, do not attempt using this blend. Your mind will be rent asunder.<br /><br />Fourth Warning: Do not attempt dosing more than the recommended dosing regimen. If you overdose on this blend, you will die convulsing in a pool of your own sexual juices. Imagine what the team sent to clean up your dead body will think when they realize that huge pool of sexual discharge is actually yours.<br /><br />Anyway, thought you guys might find this interesting. I may or may not post a series of images demonstrating the results of this blend for all to see, depends on if i can get a willing subject to convulse with orgasm for several minutes.

				Well, you all know I like to talk about drugs and sex so what better place to drop this than here.<br /><br />Got a couple hits of acid in the mail the other day. Being a responsible drug user I waited almost 2 full days before my wife had a day off work so we could take them. Inserted the tabs under the tongue, waited 20 minutes or so and swallowed em up. Not much of a come up, a few giggles but the world was still fundamentally grounded in the reality we are accustomed to. After 1.5 hours, she got up to go to the bathroom, I grabbed some MDMA, tossed it in her mouth and after she swallowed she was all &quot;What was that?&quot; God I love my girl. We decided to smoke a few bowls after which I proudly proclaimed &quot;Now we are on three kinds of drugs!&quot;. The pot really helped up the general high we are getting to.<br /><br />About 45-60 minutes after the MDMA I started kissing on her back for a while which elicited whimper and moans followed by the words &quot;Every kiss was like a little orgasm.&quot; Unlike a pure MDMA roll, my little guy was up for some playtime and we proceeded to get down with the maritals for a while which left us both rather satisfied. One more MDMA drop, an hour of kissing and touching and moaning along with quite a bit more pot which really seemed to help with this combo. We decided that the trip wasn&#039;t too visual which was a little sad for us, fortunately with a giant bag of drugs a cure was not too hard to find and we dropped about 35mg of Moxy into the mix.<br /><br />Now by this point my girl was starting to get a little tired so after flipping through some old pictures and letters together we eventually ended up snuggled in bed and watched some movies for a bit. I think this might be a uniquely Moxy related thing but the people on the TV seemed to have forgotten how to speak English. I could tell they were really trying hard but all I could hear were these low muffled sounds in place of the words most actors normally use. Eventually we opened the bag of drugs again and popped a little Xanax powder to lull our brains off to sleep and we woke up after 8 hours or so feeling all sorts of rested and happy.<br /><br />My only regret is that we clearly didn&#039;t have enough acid to take off on the experience completely. I had bought what I thought were 2 tabs of 200ug doses but 200ug should have put us in a totally different head space. This was more like 80-100ug happy mind land. It was only after 6 hours in that we took the Moxy that I was able to declare the words &quot;Baby, I just need you to confirm that the universe is bending a little bit... I&#039;m fine with it, I just want to make sure it&#039;s not just me.&quot;<br /><br />The good news was all of the drugs got along with each other just fine. I was a little worried about mixing a high dose of Moxy with the acid but with the acid running at low volume all night it worked out well. The Moxy, at the large dose, following up the last MDMA roll, left me with a really pleasant body buzzing happiness thing going until I fell asleep. <br /><br />Anyway, we all know Candy-Flipping is fun, just thought I would confirm it to all my nasty little friends out there in the virtual world and confirm that adding some Moxy to the mix does not, at least for us, cause people to fall over and die. Next adventure will be twice as much acid, some MDA and then Moxy or 2CB as needed for visual additions.<br /><br />Happy Tripping!

She had one of those implants that makes it impossible to get pregnant for a certain amount of years. I&#039;ve been with girls on BC and only on rare rare occasions where they fucked up enough to say &quot;yeah cum inside of me&quot;. I&#039;m not opposed to the period sex thing, I just find many girls who are opposed to it. <br /><br />The only other time I get to cum inside of someone is when I pick someone up at a bar, and I&#039;m like &quot;hey are you on BC?&quot; and they say no... and then I say &quot;Ok but do you know what my name is?&quot; and if they say no... well then BLAAM!!! All up inside of her, then I bounce.<br /><br />HAHA j/k of course. <br /><br />Nothing better than completing my entire orgasm inside of someone though, I seriously need to get this situation back into my life, because pulling out and having my orgasm outside of a woman, no matter where she lets me shoot it, or if she swallows it... well it just doesn&#039;t satisfy me. Not many chicks I fuck with like anal either... which even isn&#039;t my own preference, but at least I get to experience my entire orgasm while inside of her.<br /><br />And FUCK blowjobs, I absolutely despise getting blowjobs... I mean I enjoy them, but there ain&#039;t no way I&#039;m about to waste some of my nut inside her mouth... I&#039;m going to have an orgasm and you aren&#039;t? Bitch you must be trippin&#039;!

Candy Flipping is just taking some acid and a couple hours in, once it hits, dropping some MDMA to turn it into a love trip. Ideally you&#039;ve taken enough LSD to actually get going pretty good as some fairly magical things happen when all of your senses are operating in different dimensions but the brain is chemically locked in on love. <br /><br />Highly recommended if you haven&#039;t tried it yet but I would suggest taking LSD on it&#039;s own at least once to fully appreciate it before you add MDMA into the equation. You can have some amazing times on LSD alone but the trip can go to a lot of different places, MDMA just helps point it towards love.

Turns my dick into a thick veined hulk like creation that can make a girl cum just out of fear of having that monster inside of her. For $1&#039;s worth of a thick rubber band it can be a bit of fun.&nbsp;

That&#039;s part of my standard procedure: foreplay, including oral, then a few minutes of fucking until I cum, then going back to oral/manual stimulation until she cums and then some cuddling/fondling/general chilling.<br />I don&#039;t understand guys who prefer the in-out-done way of sex over the passionate, respectful way of sex. It&#039;ll leave you a lot more satisfied because not only are you satisfied from the orgasm, you also know that you have given that same pleasure to someone you (hopefully) care about.<br />Also, eating pussy is fucking hot.

That was a problem for me because for some weird reason my dick is the most sensitive at its base so I always have to go ballz deep to cum.

That girl was SOOOO pissed off at me, I have no idea how we managed to spark a relationship after that. In my case it wasn&#039;t that I didn&#039;t want to get her pregnant it was just that it was our FIRST TIME and I was about to bust a nut in her after like 3 minutes of fucking. I didn&#039;t want to look like a two pump chump and had no idea that look on her face was &quot;Oh my god I&#039;m about to cum.&quot;<br /><br />Eventually we got our timing all sorted out but man that was almost a deal breaker for us. The first time with someone new is supposed to be a little awkward but normally if the girl starts screaming at you it&#039;s gone a step or two past that. <br /><br />&nbsp;

But this was the first time a dealer told me which strain I&#039;m getting without lying.<br />And how cool is it that Skywalker is a cross of Blueberry and Mazar! That can&#039;t be a coincidence :D

				I&#039;m with kitkat on this being sexually frustrating, simply the story of my life considering the ex is a complete and total psycho even though she is the best fuck I&#039;ve ever had and it seems like the old days of just sending a text or calling someone to have a night of bliss are long gone. Also, I find girls to be pretty crazy about letting their partner just blow their load inside of them condom or not, its either A. NO DONT FUCKING DO THAT ARE YOU CRAZY or B. YOU MUST, there happens to be no in between with anyone that I have met. I&#039;d totally be down to mess around with a decent looking girl who would let me just cum in her (condom and birth control of course) because I sure don&#039;t want to be paying for diapers.

				Ok, DIZ, <br /><br />Firstly, coming inside WITH a condom DOES NOT COUNT (maybe for you, but not the same for us girlzz)<br /><br />2) Hot chicks that you consider crazy... it&#039;s just a goddamn complex that comes from being able to get whatever you want, whenever you want it by batting an eyelash.

				At one point when I was young and vibrant, I was dating this girl and realized she sort of enjoyed me being a sub to my dom. One night we were at play, I stripped her naked and let her eat my cock for a while before asking her if she wanted to do it doggy style. She nodded with anticipation and bent over willingly, her ample ass and wet pussy waiting for me to mount her.<br /><br />I got close and whispered in her ear... &quot;Then bark for me bitch...&quot;<br /><br />After about 10 minutes of yapping she finally earned her prize. <br /><br />I guess the moral of the story is Diz if you have a girl that is telling you what to do in bed sometimes you just need to remind the bitch what her place is.<br /><br />All right, I earned the - karma for that. I was young and foolish once, it&#039;s not my fault!

I absolutely hate it. I already have no choice but to use magnum sized condoms, but they still don&#039;t make enough room on the tip of those things. It&#039;s not even that I&#039;m saying my dick is too long for the condom, that&#039;s not the case at all, the problem is that the length and space left once it is on is often not enough to handle the entire volume of cum I can produce on the average day. What happens is the condom fills up and can no longer hold any more sperm, but they make condoms so well now a days that they simply won&#039;t pop. It just cuts off my ability to cum while there is still cum that hasn&#039;t cum yet. It&#039;s like the irritation you get when you stop peeing mid stream, except 25 times more irritating and painful. I fucking hate condoms. Orgasms should not be painful ever for any reason, but even if I tried to pull out, pull off the condom and then cum, not only would I feel completely ridiculous but I also probably wouldn&#039;t even actually cum by the time I went through those motions. Fuck my life... my dick is a curse.

				TrashBox, reply #543, quote by fuckingACE. He was right to make that post. I won&#039;t make this thread go off-topic.<br /><br />What I will say is that this thread has provided some candidness. If you can&#039;t talk about sex fantasies on Off-topic without being criticised then you start to wonder if the criticizer has intimacy problems. What started as an innocent post from you on fantasing about DrGonzo has had changes on me you won&#039;t know about. That&#039;s how life works. A simple post can change things through cause-and-effect like you wouldn&#039;t believe. <br /><br />Most of the people that have posted here have done so in a friendly spirit. Or maybe some of us are just horny. But it is better than trolling people or talking crap on other threads so this thread was a pleasant break for me (from threads where they did) that and one I loved to visit. Thank you for providing me with some great memories and giving me the opportunity to meet people I would not have otherwise run into.<br /><br />Now get back to sex talk already! ;)

				Not to go on about how awesome I am but my dick is just average, a little girthy, but it has a nice curve to it that always manages to hit the spot. I know guys like to talk about having a huge dick and all but I&#039;d really just rather leave my girl breathless and wondering how my seemingly inconspicuous little pecker just made her cum like that.<br /><br />My first real girlfriend was dating a guy that was hung like a horse and I never once worried about having a small dick since it actually made her feel good rather than leaving her torn and crying. Once she rode my pony she ditched the horse and settled in for a long fun ride. <br /><br />Us guys are seriously fucked up about dick size though. I&#039;m pretty sure most of the ills of the world are in some way related to some guy thinking his dick isn&#039;t big enough and feeling like he needs to do something to make him an even bigger dick.

				D, your words are like eargasisms so I can only imagine your dick would be blisssssfull... but that&#039;s that whole reality vs imagination BS and I&#039;m trying not to go there bc Atnas wants to discuss sex. And this is my sex thread (although also a fantasy thread, however&nbsp; ??? ). Annnnd I like to talk about sex. So moving on... <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=96481.msg878265#msg878265">Quote from: DiamondSky on March 04, 2013, 06:47 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />Us guys are seriously fucked up about dick size though.

You guys ARE fucked up about dick size. So let&#039;s discuss so I can fuck you up even more&nbsp; :-*<br /><br />Being a lusty female I&#039;ve seen my share of DICK. The good, the bad, and the &quot;Oh, that&#039;s not soooo bad&quot;, so I&#039;ll share my thoughts on your theory, D: <br />~ War is def about men feeling inadequate about their dam dicks. Women don&#039;t want to fight. We want to LOVE. (for more on this, see recent posts in &quot;Have You Ever Cheated&quot; thread)<br />~ None of the men I&#039;ve slept with (so far) have NEEDED a magnum, but one, in particular, used them. Upon first glance of the black box, I thought Alriiiighhhttttt... but turns out he was BIG, but the magnum was not necessary... just made me think he used them for show. Didn&#039;t sleep with him again either. Too cocky. <br />~ Men who have a big dick WILL TELL YOU ABOUT ASAP. Seriously. And this is becoming even more true now that I have joined this forum (maybe bc i posted that chicks get crazy after they get good dick, idk)<br />~ Men with a small dick will say they have some special function... &quot;it&#039;s curved&quot;, &quot;I have a hurricane tongue&quot;, &quot;I&#039;ll make you come 200x&quot;, &quot;it&#039;s vein-y and ribbed&quot;, &quot;I last ALL NIGHT&quot;, etc. These are all actually great excuses (I&#039;ll take 200 orgasms over a big dick any day). It&#039;s just that, sadly, these are actually just excuses to get in your (my) pants and when dude doesn&#039;t deliver it&#039;s a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. For me, a BIG dick can always deliver so.........<br />~ For some reason, the men that I&#039;ve ended up in long relationships with have been well-endowed in the dick department. Also,&nbsp; they are ALL pretty confident, but not arrogant (well, one ex was SUPER arrogant, but I quickly realized I hated him and GTFO)<br /><br />I think I could talk about dick all day........<br />

				Since its Dick discussion day, I wanted to share my story about my dick.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get to see a lot of other dicks really, but I wanted to know if other guys have a curve to their wang?&nbsp; Mine curves left and about 15-20 degrees too.&nbsp; Its quite noticable.&nbsp; Every time I ask chicks if its OK ya know, and they all say ya sure no big deal.&nbsp; But for me, I&#039;m quite self concsious about it, ya know.&nbsp; <br /><br />I guess on a good note, the tip rubs against the vagina wall nice and hard so the stimulation is nice for me.&nbsp; I had a girlfriend though, who went to her doctor because she was bleeding each time we did it and she didn&#039;t know why.&nbsp; She said it was only with me that it happened.&nbsp; Other girls say there is no difference though.<br /><br />As for size, we girls say it don&#039;t matter much, but I know it does.&nbsp; Mine measures at 8.5 and I always wonder how big the guy before me was for the girl I&#039;m with..... . . mmmmmm

				Without Further Ado,<br />The Explicit Review of the TSC Sexy Weekend Kit<br />Starring: Opium-Hash and TrashBox&#039;s SexyTime Playlist<br /><br />It all began with a package that was stealthily packed...<br />can you say double-sealed vacuum packaging? Yes, I sure can. Couldn&#039;t smell shit til I got through the first seal...and then the lovely spicy earthy smell filled my nostrils. If you&#039;ve read my review of the opium-hash, then you know about this already. <br /><br />I had it all prepared; the knives, the stove, little balls of opium-hash ready to go, my half-bottle to catch all the wonderful-tasting vapor when my lady-friend arrived in sexy attire fit for only the sexiest PlayBoy Bunnies. TrashBox, I don&#039;t know what you look like, but you might have some competition. Watching her take long inhales of the opium-hash vapor I produced by touching the hot knife to the perfect round putty was arousing on its own. On her exhale, she let her shirt slip off her shoulder, exposing amazing lingerie. I could feel the sexual vibrations emanating from her as I used my iPhone to remote control my computer and turn on TrashBox&#039;s SexyTime Playlist. <br /><br />It was time to get down with the get-down if ya know what I mean ;)<br /><br />Not to take away from my own skills in the sheets, but she was absolutely drippin after a few hits. I was so rock hard and turned on by my own few hits of this delectable combo that I thought I had taken Viagra by accident. Had my ladyfriend slipped some in my drink? Shit, so high. The opium was just enough to ensure a long-lasting session of bed bangin, something around the two hour mark. Slow and sensual, the way that sensi flows. From time to time, when I came out of my loved-up, stoned-out, opiated stupor long enough, I found myself commenting about the remarkable playlist that came with the kit. Jesus, it&#039;s a good thing I wore a condom or I woulda been makin babies all night. <br /><br />After a few hours of love making with this honey bunny, it was time for sleep. A few more hits of the opium-hash sandwiched between some high quality Spanish bud led me to a wonderful sexy sleep accompanied by my lovely sexytime ladyfriend. <br /><br />Hope ya enjoyed this sexy review by ZipSyle,<br />brought to you by the fucking BADASS <br />The Scurvy Crew.<br /><br />and that&#039;s wussup my niggas.
