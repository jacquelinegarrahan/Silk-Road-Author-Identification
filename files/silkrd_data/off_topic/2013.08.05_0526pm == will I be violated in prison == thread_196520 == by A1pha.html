				Jail isn&#039;t that bad. Violent rape tends to happen in max security prisons where violent offenders are and if you are young and get put in an adult facility with a bunch of lifers. It also happens to guys convicted of sexual assault or child sex crimes because they are open season in prison. <br /><br />Jail is boring for the most part. You read the same books, work a lot and eat the same shitty food. Medium/Light security hardly any bullshit goes on. Just follow the rules of jail:<br /><br />- don&#039;t ask anybody about their crime or &#039;business&#039; or anything personal<br />- don&#039;t complain, because older guy&#039;s who have been there for a decade + will KO you<br />- do your own time, not somebody else&#039;s which means don&#039;t do any smuggling, hits, beatings for other people<br />- don&#039;t join a gang (see do your own time rule)<br />- don&#039;t borrow anything ever or accept anything offered to you ever (it&#039;s a trap)<br />- don&#039;t talk about somebody if they aren&#039;t around<br />- don&#039;t retaliate if somebody says &quot;Hey that guy talked about you&quot; (see do your own time rule.. it&#039;s a trick to get you to fight somebody for them) your reply should be &quot;He can say it to my face otherwise it doesn&#039;t matter to me&quot;<br />- go hard if you get in a fight. it&#039;s not if you win or lose, it&#039;s your willingness to stand up for yourself <br />- don&#039;t talk to guards they are all scumbags/corrupt and other prisoners will think you are snitching<br />- don&#039;t snitch in prison about anything you see <br />- if some guy offers to walk with you to chow on your first day there (and not your cellmate) say no <br />- ask about the stupid prison rules (like where you stand around outside in the yard) your cellie tells you this<br />- if your cellie gets in a fight you usually have to help him but depends on the prison and if the guy is a total moron or not<br />- don&#039;t eat at a table with people outside your &#039;race&#039; in a US prison due to idiocy<br />- make sure to say you are either Jewish or request Hindu food from the prison officials so you don&#039;t get the mystery meat which makes you sick. any attempt to one up the prison system is considered great success by other inmates<br />- dear god, don&#039;t go in with a shamrock tattoo or any tattoo that looks like an existing gang logo or they will give you 24hrs to remove it and if you don&#039;t they do it for you with a knife<br />- if somebody asks what your in there for don&#039;t lie, they will find out. some prisoners want to see your &#039;papers&#039; upon entry to determine where you fit in the hierarchy. those are your sentencing/court papers and trial records. sexual assault, you might get killed/raped. if you shot a cop, you&#039;re now the president of the prison. <br />- don&#039;t talk about your crime to anybody in pre-trial, they are informants just say what you are accused of<br />MOST IMPORTANT!! - the prison phone is always bugged, and your calls to your lawyer are not protected it&#039;s total bullshit but welcome to 2013 and meet Kafka and Orwell.<br /><br />SECOND MOST IMPORTANT!! - if you maintain a prison blog do it anonymously. Any criticism of the BOP or state prison and they throw you in the hole for months at a time. They&#039;ve also been known to give prisoners the worst punishment known to man which is chaining you to a prison bus and moving you all over the country 24/7 for months at a time. Imagine diesel fumes for a year straight, they have done this to dissidents. They also put you on a plane rides endlessly too just to fuck with you until you want to die. Prison officials read all prison blogs/search for them (hello NSA) and if they see any pictures taken inside everybody in it get&#039;s solitary for a month at least. Doesn&#039;t matter if you have written authorization to take the picture from the &quot;official&quot; prison camerman and the warden himself tells you it&#039;s OK to post the picture. They hole you anyways. Again, welcome to the dystopian future of state oppression and your new home where National Geographic is considered contraband.<br /><br />Finally beware of common tricks to get you to fight. You&#039;re walking around the yard. Look at a guy. &#039;WHAT U LOOKIN AT&#039; you&#039;re response should not be &quot;NOTHING&quot; because he will say &quot;SO I&#039;M NOTHING TO YOU?&quot; and fight begins. Your response should be &quot;No disrespect, sun in my eyes&quot; then he get&#039;s confused and has nothing and walks away. Unless you want to bash the guy&#039;s face in but anybody picking a fight with you usually has some sort of upper hand which is why they are picking a fight. They&#039;re either connected gangsters that will make your life hell or carrying a weapon.<br /><br />None of this applies to Miami prison lol. If you live in Miami and deal move now or take MMA 24/7 to get as hard as possible because you&#039;ll have to fight like 10 guys at once when you walk in the door.
