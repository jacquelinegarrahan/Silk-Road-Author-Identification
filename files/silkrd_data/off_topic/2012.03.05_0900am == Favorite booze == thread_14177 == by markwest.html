				Shit, son. A bottle of Captain Morgan&#039;s Parrot Bay Coconut Rum in a Pi√±a Colada or chased with some Sunny Delight makes me a drunk(and happy) bitch.<br /><br />Got alot of memories with that shit. &lt;3<br />That AND Burnette&#039;s Vanilla Vodka, but I know that at least probably 90% of people will cringe at the thought of vanilla vodka, lol! I&#039;m not old enough to buy it, I told my friend I wanted vanilla Coke and he comes back with Burnette&#039;s Vanilla Vodka. Cracked my shit up... Oh man, those were good good times. :&#039;)

				Beer all the way. Don&#039;t really care for the brand, but usually Amstel, Heineken or Bavaria. Preferably with a line of coke on the side.<br /><br />If we&#039;re out of beer, rum cola is fine too. Nice sweet Havana club.

				I love me my alcohol. Beer is what I drink most often, but my favorite drink is a Chocolate Martini. Off the hook!<br /><br />2 oz of Vanilla vodka<br />2 oz (Clear) Creme de Cocoa<br />Small splash of Baileys Irish creme<br /><br />Shaken not stirred, lol. And then take some grated bakers chocolate and sprinkle on top. Real good drink. It tastes like a chocolate tootsie roll.

				Irish Whiskey 1 part water, 1 part whiskey, yes im a wimp ;D, despise un flavored vodka, i think it tatse like straight alchol with no flavor. Rum is good too. But i have 3 drinks max, drinking is too much work too little pay off, plus im special apparently cuz my gag reflex only gets stonger when i drink, like 4th shot and ill vomit for sure, and im not even that drunk, takes around 9 shots to black out. So here i am 18 and ill ready over drinking

I am merely commenting on society&#039;s inappropriate portrayal and acceptance of EtOH as something less dangerous and destructive than a &quot;drug&quot; <br /><br />PLEASE explain to me, seriously, how you justify such a statement in your own twisted reality. I am honestly wanting you to provide any even seemingly approaching rational explanation for such a frankly confusing and myopic comment<br /><br />also, please do not respond as you did in the last thread when I asked for a clarification of what exactly you meant. I questioned the validity of the phase &quot;socially acceptable&quot; and in response you said well obviously E was more socially acceptable than H (which is the exact thing you said initially just rephrased). Bro you missed the entire fucking point I was talking about... <br /><br />ALL you did was say alcohol shouldnt be treated as a drugs and then provided a number of SUBJECTIVE experiences which quite frankly dont mean shit when it comes to the classification of a molecule. <br /><br />If anything, maybe you are correct and alcohol should not be considered and drug, and society should start portraying alcohol as the POISON it truthfully and more accurately is given the at least three or four hundred people who DIE every year in the US from alcohol POISONING.&nbsp; Every year thousands of additional deaths are related to alcohol in the US just not directly poisoning. EtOH is one of the leading causes of deaths for teenagers and young adults as well as a huge percentage of adults, is involved in a huge portion (i think majority) of fatal traffic accidents. The societial costs of alcohol alone rival that any illicit drug, many even combined... Every time I drink alcohol I cant stand the taste and it tastes foul and disgusting, and was just a means to an end of feeling like I was poisoned and regretting my actions. <br /><br />If you are measuring things subjectively... I very frequently take a hit on my bong for the flavor but do not get high. I just like the act of smoking and the lovely taste. My driving skills are not impaired so therefore marijuana should not be considered a drug obviously. It should however be considered a medicine given the fact how many states allow patients to use it for the scientifically confirmed medical benefits, so it shouldnt be treated as a drug. Marijuana has NEVER killed a SINGLE person, so obviously it is safe and should not be treated as a drug. Do you see where I am going... marijuana is certainly still a drug even though it is also a medicine. <br /><br />For you to say alcohol should not really be considered a drug because you enjoy sipping on it but dont enjoy toking on a bowl of weed is asinine. It goes back to your belief because alcohol is legal and more acceptable in the eyes of society one can dismiss its negative qualities and even the safety considerations that come into consideration when consuming a drug.... you should keep in mind society is horribly misinformed and frankly completely uneducated. What they find to be socially acceptable is not a decent indication of what is appropriate for ones own life. only you should be deciding that, which was my point on the other thread about &quot;socially unacceptable&quot; heroin use... <br /><br />Sorry if I was ranting but I absolutely hate the stigma society places on drug use when they simply do not even understand the realities regarding the drugs that are currently legal! and i hate to see these idea perpetuated further without me saying how I feel about the situation. <br /><br />Love to all, even markwest who I completely disagree with :P<br />- miR

In terms of damage and addiction, alcohol ranks third behind only heroin and cocaine... crazy huh? I am still open to try absinthe, however, seeing how it recently had its legality overturned. =)

				The best beer in the Americas is Club Verde, excellent hoppy lager from my adopted home of Ecuador, it&#039;s won Gold Medals in Belgium and has just started to export, it is a lovely crisp and dry with a full bodied flavour, truly it&#039;s the only good beer in this country but it is very good.<br /><br />Any single malt whiskey is a treat, very hard to get here, Ardbeg is my favorite but quite impossible to get.&nbsp; I&#039;ve switched to drinking rum straight or with ice and lime juice, I can get very nice rums much cheaper than any whiskey. <br /><br />I have got into Malbec (Red Wine) from Argentina and I like Merlot as well but I haven&#039;t been able to stomach much red wine recently, seems to make me sick too easily.<br /><br />Puntas/Wanchaka our local moonshine is a great 180 to 190 Proof alcohol and at $2.50 the gallon it really is the cheapest way to get fucked and it doesn&#039;t give you a bad head ache either, I&#039;ve got a soft spot for it but I&#039;ve learnt to treat it with respect because you can drink too much too easily.

I simply used marijuana as an example because it is similar to alcohol as a legal (in some places) recreational drug but this does not make me a weed warrior. I only was being faceitious and called EtOH poison, so didnt want to do so without some legitimate fact to back my claim... I even stated I have no vendetta against alcohol use and support the recreational usage for those who enjoy the effects.<br /><br />Please do not call me a liar which I take offense to and you have absolutely no right or evidence. Many strains are also grown for the aromas, appearance and flavor not just potency. Each has a unique taste that I savor much in the same way people compare beer or wine. I however have been smoking daily for years and have a tolerance, so one hit will not get me high. I will take a hit ONLY for the flavor, especially in the case of purps I smoke less than I need even get a buzz in order to conserve. How am I a liar??? And then I will go and give my friends who are too trashed to drive a ride because it is SAFE for me to drive, much in the way it would be safe if I had drank one beer. I am in absolutely no way impaired, high, stoned, or anything... How does this make me a dickhead??? If you really think I am a dickhead, I dont frankly fucking care what you think about me, cause your approval couldnt mean less to me given your attitude and ignorant unenlightened perspective of the world. If you want to say how you feel, so will I: you are astonishingly disrespectful and so narcissistic it disgusts me. My point still completely invalidates your argument regardless of whether you want to acknowledge it or not. <br /><br />By the way, those people did NOT die from marijuana, they died of physical trauma :P people actually die from the toxicity of alcohol was my point... <br /><br />I was honestly just curious why you felt that way and stated such a thing, I think you should always at least have a rational foundation for your beliefs and be able to explain your reasoning. You should not just base your beliefs on something trivial like &quot;socially acceptable.&quot; Instead you just essentially disregard everything I say and arrogantly reiterate the point without acknowledging the errors in your thought process. I would still appreciate it if you would just think about and explain to me why you believe alcohol shouldnt be treated as a drug. Give me a definition, anything other than your subjective opinion that every drug tastes like shit except alcohol...<br /><br />Please show me the respect I deserve. With love always,<br />- microRNA<br /><br />PS. A relationship with the women I love just ended so if I sound irritated obviously I am, please excuse me...

I simply am curious about your perspective.<br /><br />I agree that there are many uses for ethanol other than just simply intoxication... however, I really dont understand how/why you dont see that alcohol is also a drug. You say EtOH should NEVER be viewed as a drug??? I just simply can not rationalize in any way what exactly you mean or why you think that. It is a certainly a molecule that people commonly and frequently ingest with the purpose of altering their state of consciousness. No matter the other beneficial uses for a molecule, if it fits that definition it IS a drug as well. imo you cannot disregard an aspect of something and only focus on those aspects you desire... all aspects must be taken into consideration even if not applicable to all specific circumstances. <br /><br />What I mainly disagree with is society&#039;s portrayal of Drugs and Alcohol... my points were just that alcohol most certainly is a drug in addition to all its other uses, but when it is used as a drug people should not discount the fact it has serious risk for addiction and other dangers... it is not safer, less of a &quot;drug,&quot; or more acceptable just because it is legal. <br /><br />I agree that ethanol has other uses than just being a drug. Do you not agree that alcohol is also a drug... and appropriate to consider it as such?<br />- miRNA

				MW your thoughts on my reply to our discussion would be appreciated when you have the chance. Thanks<br /><br />Has anyone ever tried a sour beer? A year or two ago when I still drank occasionally I tried a few of these with have high contents of lactic acid, producing a sour taste which was actually very delicious for a beer. The bacteria lactobacillus is used in the starter culture which produces the unusual fermentation product. I have also tried one that was started on a base of cherries I believe, so it was more like a sour wine and was also a very interesting EtOH beverage. Is there anyone else here that has tried other unusual types of brews or any special beers worth mentioning? <br /><br />- miR

				I will take a good, high quality beer over anything.&nbsp; Kwak, Duvel, Delirium Nocturnum, Gulden Draak, pretty much anything Belgian.&nbsp; The UK has some good ones as well - I love Sam Smith&#039;s Oatmeal Stout so very much.&nbsp; The USA has a few good varieties; I like pretty much anything brewed by New Belgium, and Terrapin makes some really interesting beers.&nbsp; Honestly, I could go on and on and on about beers.&nbsp; It&#039;s a passion.<br /><br />If it&#039;s gonna be liquor, it&#039;s bourbon.&nbsp; Maybe a little lemon lime soda to mix, or just ice.&nbsp; I also enjoy red wine, though I keep to the sweeter end of the spectrum.&nbsp; Cabernet generally just burns my mouth out.

				thats actually really interesting you mentioned terrapin, if its the brewery in GA i am very familiar with it. they certainly do have some good brews. Nothing beats a terrapin at the Globe with a gypsy folk band playing upstairs... How i miss those days. i thought terrapin was a lesser known name.
