				So I&#039;m new to SR and I haven&#039;t ordered or vended anything, yet, this has nothing to do with you guys and you&#039;ll probably think I&#039;m paranoid...<br /><br />I live in S. America in a fairly village like neighborhood, most people know each other (to put this in context, police are generally inept, but not always so)<br /><br />So a few years ago I made friends with a guy in my neighborhood.&nbsp; Cool guy, we&#039;d smoke up together and chat since we share many interests.&nbsp; My friend writes music and sings in a band.<br /><br />So along comes a guy and makes friends with my friend.&nbsp; Says he has friends in the States with record companies, lies, is going to help the band get a record contract, some pretty in depth and over the top lies.<br /><br />I called this person for what he was.&nbsp; Stupid me.<br /><br />Then I was more stupid and started referring to this person as a &quot;mentiroso chismoso&quot; or big gossiping liar.<br /><br />Even worse he knew I smoked weed and I thought it was no big deal.<br /><br />Anyway, the big liar made friends with some police in my hood and has told them that I do drugs or worse.<br /><br />He told the local shopkeeper (another gossip, I think she&#039;s friendly) that there&#039;s going to be a big operation against drug users/dealers and I am on the list.<br /><br />Fortunately I happened to fuck off to another country at the time of this problem.<br /><br />However, this is not just some paranoid rumor shit:&nbsp; My wife got asked by a police if she knew any tall gringos who lived in the area, saying he was part of some anti-drug unit.&nbsp; The shop keeper lady saw a whole load of other foreigners in a police transport getting taken away while I was away.&nbsp; &nbsp;And a few good dealers (all whom I&#039;ve bought from) in the area also got arrested while I was away.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wasn&#039;t gone even a month and all this shit happens.<br /><br />Oh and the fucking liar came to the shop keeper lady and said that the police haven&#039;t seen me.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I went away having heard via the shop lady that I might be under investigation or whatever and come back to this shit.... <br /><br />I am a fucking retard, I should never have caused a problem over this guy lying through his teeth, that my friend and his band mates dropped studies and work to practice for a record deal that never was going to come was there own problem, I should never have let this fucking liar know I smoke or anything.<br /><br />I&#039;ve cleaned out my house, double checked for spliff ends and seeds (major jail time here for seeds and my weed always has a load of seeds) I&#039;m not buying any weed and I haven&#039;t consumed anything since I got back.&nbsp; &nbsp;I know for safety&#039;s sake I shouldn&#039;t bring any drugs into my neighborhood for a good long while, so I won&#039;t: smoking weed would only make me super paranoid right now.<br /><br />I suggested to my wife that now that our house is clean and is going to be like this for at least 6 months that I should go and talk to the cops as well... tell them I know they are looking for me but that I don&#039;t have anything to hide.&nbsp; She said I am mad, it&#039;ll only bring heat.<br /><br />My brother-in-law thinks I should sue the liar for saying I do drugs and whatnot, the law here about slander/libel is pretty tough and he could go to jail for up to three years and he can&#039;t prove it even though it was true. (My brother in law is mad though and I think his suggestions are generally either completely stupid and/or genius)<br /><br />I think if I just wait it out then I&#039;ll be fine...&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to consume for a while and cleaning out my system is probably good in itself.&nbsp; But goddamnit, this fucks me off and screws with my head in ways I am sure you can all imagine.<br /><br />Thanks for reading if anyone did read all that crap.&nbsp; I&#039;m not looking for sympathy and less advice, I know I&#039;ve gotta go see a lawyer and stay clean until I am sure the heats off and then wait another half year, and never ever ever cause problems or let people know I do drugs..... god I am stupid.

				No, dont do anything. By all means speak to a lawyer, if you can find a decent one, and fore warn them that there may be an action against you but do not go to the police. Why do their job for them? If your place is clean then you have nothing to worry about, hearsay is probably not going to stand up in court as evidence.

				Never thought police still like to bust village areas, but hell guess they are more concerned with big time players. Thanks for sharing anyway.

				Do not go to the cops.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Let them do their &quot;job&quot;.&nbsp; If you are clean that&#039;s great.<br /><br />In the meantime if the police actually investigate you it might be worthwhile to sue the douche-bag just for the hell of it, maybe give him a dose of his own medicine.&nbsp; Anyone who would send violent thugs after another human being for personal consumption habits deserves to be locked into a cage, no exceptions...

				bigglesworth: thanks for reminding me how impractical suing the guy would be.<br /><br />re going to the police: I figured that I could convince them that I am not a bad guy and that I have stopped/never did the whole drug thing.&nbsp; Most people here get a hard on for gringo&#039;s and treat us differently than everyone else.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wasn&#039;t going to go with the intention of confessing, just to say &quot;I know you&#039;re looking for me, but this guy is a fucking liar and you shouldn&#039;t listen to him, I am a good guy, let me buy you a couple of beers&quot; my philosophy has always been to make friends with everyone except the jackasses.
