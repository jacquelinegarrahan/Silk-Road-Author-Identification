				Title says it all what drugs or drug combos would one recommend taking before a party. I&#039;ve tried mdma+viagra and had a pretty good time but wasn&#039;t really able to participate until after the peak. What else might be worth picking up before we attend our next party?

				I&#039;d look into GHB. What might be fun is taking 100mg of MDMA, after 90 minutes dose with a moderate amount of GHB (you should research GHB prior and test it to know your sensitivity) and do another moderate GHB dose in an hour. GHB is also good at stripping the &quot;come&quot; down feeling of MDMA and unlike MDMA it actually puts you in the mood and doesn&#039;t negatively affect performance except causing you to last longer but is that bad? (Only if you have an I can never come problem)<br /><br />Then you are able to sleep afterwards. I mean go to sleep not crash&nbsp; ;D

				If you&#039;re going to a swigner party, I&#039;d suggest methylone (about 200mg) + 50mg of viagra (or 100mg, if you have problems with erections normally). It feels more erotic than MDMA, and adds a desire to experiment and push boundaries. At least for me. I really like taking methylone rectally, as the come up is faster, and the high feels cleaner to me. It also ads a touch of extra eroticism for me (I&#039;m straight)<br /><br />5-MeO-MiPT makes sex feel amazing, and reduces the refractory period a lot. However, I&#039;ve found that I need a fairly high dose (9-12mg) and at those doses (for me at least) it gives you a fairly strong psychedelic high, and I find I feel stoned and slightly confused. It&#039;s great at home, but I think it would make me uncomfortable at a party (of any kind)<br /><br />This weekend, I&#039;m going to try methylone + hash, as I find that cannabis products also enhance sex.

				@TheGrandWizard yeah I&#039;ve heard good things about everything you listed. I have some mipt on the way so I&#039;ll probably give that a trial run in a safe home setting and if it isn&#039;t to bad take it before the swingers club. <br /><br />@MasterS The last trip to the swingers club I ate 100mg of molly and a 50mg viagra pill, I was able to get hard, but finishing was not going to happen. Of course in that situation that is never a bad thing lol, but there were a few times I just had to step away because the roll was pretty intense even on that low of a dose with the combo of booze and weed. I&#039;ve never had GHB, but I will do some research and see if it is something worth trying. <br /><br />@Banjo Thanks for the tip on the Methylone I have some laying around from when all the US molly vendors were gone. I agree it did add some eroticism to the roll more than molly. I&#039;ve never plugged before but I&#039;m always up for something new. THe last time at the swingers club I dosed 100mg of molly+50mg of viagra and had a good time, but had to wait till after peek to start fooling around.&nbsp; I have some mipt on the way so I&#039;ll probably give that try in a safe setting first and if it works well explore it in a club or group setting. I can usually hold my own pretty well on psychedelics, but since it is new to me better safe than sorry. <br />

				MDMA is fun for me during sex.&nbsp; I am able to last forever, and it feels really good getting your dick sucked.&nbsp; Only down fall for me is not being able to finish though, I had sex with one of the hottest girls last weekend.&nbsp; I pounded her so hard she said she has never had a guy give it to her that good, unfortunately I could not cum.&nbsp; Next day I had horrible rug burns on my knees, still was worth it, with I was able to bust in her face though :(&nbsp; &nbsp;Upside is this girl will not stop texting me so I am going to give her round two in a few days on no drugs, bet I bust in 2 minutes&nbsp; 8)

				My vote&#039;s for 2C-B if you want the entactogenic, or GHB for the raunchy.

				+1 for GHB<br /><br />However... make sure to test your tolerance to it beforehand.&nbsp; It&#039;s easy to overdose &amp; wind up passing out for a couple hours.&nbsp; GHB defintiely lowers inhibitions, especially in females.<br /><br />Another one to try as a substitute to viagra is Yohimbe bark.&nbsp; It&#039;s legal &amp; easily available.&nbsp; Was traditionally used as an aphrodesiaic &amp; E.D. treatment in west africa. It also has a stimulant-like side-effect as well.&nbsp;
