				So the other day (read &quot;any given amount of time ago that wasn&#039;t today&quot; lol) I had just gotten back to my room with a nice little bit of coke.&nbsp; Did my whole little routine, put it away, set all my other stuff down and opened my door (Communal housing).&nbsp; One of the people who lives next door came over and started giving me crap because I hadn&#039;t come home a couple nights before so she was asking what I did and whatnot.&nbsp; I joked around and said &quot;I can&#039;t tell you what I did, You&#039;ll judge me.&quot; Her response? &quot;Come on now! I wouldn&#039;t judge you! Not unless you were doing cocaine or something.&quot;&nbsp; -facepalm-<br /><br /><br />Just the timing made it terribly ironic.&nbsp; Anyone else have moments like this that made them snicker a bit inside?&nbsp; I feel like I run across them all the time.&nbsp; Share your stories! It&#039;s fun to get a good laugh.&nbsp; :)

				Had a kid claim I cut his coke with weed once. He apparently thought I had taken a leafy green substance and successfully mixed it with a powdery white substance to the point that you could not tell through a clear plastic bag.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t even know what to say to him.<br /><br />Someone else asked me &quot;How much will $20 of weed cost?&quot; the other day. ::)

				This isn&#039;t a funny thing someone said to me, but it is a rather funny story from last year. I was a freshman in college just starting to get into drugs a bit, mostly weed though. I would sell small amounts to friends, but that was it. I wasn&#039;t doing any hardcore dealing or anything, just helping out friends. So one time one of my friends told me that &quot;someone he knew&quot; would be coming to my dorm to buy a few grams from me. I told him that was fine, and waited downstairs for the van his &quot;friend&quot; would be driving. Well I got in the van and there was a fucking 60 year old woman sitting in the driver&#039;s seat. She turns to me, wordlessly hands me my money, and I handed her the bag of weed with what must have been a very shocked expression on my face. <br /><br />I got out of the car and walked silently back to my room, where then I began laughing like crazy because I couldn&#039;t believe what I had just done. Shit got way too real that day.

				^ shits as real as it gets.&nbsp; In high school I sold weed once to my environment teacher, she was in her 60&#039;s and didn&#039;t have dank connects.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br /><br />My lawyer experienced LSD for the first time after defending me in trial as we celebrated together.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are now very good companions and he still picks up 10 strips every other month or so.

				Woah woah woah, slow down there Holly. Are saying that GOOD people like teachers and lawyers can do DRUGS? I&#039;m completely taken aback right now. I mean personally, I have over a 3.9 GPA in college and I got in over the 90th percentile on the practice LSAT I just took, but still, I&#039;m just a dumb college student. Legitimate people with real careers trip acid?? What about the War on Drugs?? SAVE THE CHILDREN!<br /><br />Sorry, I have to take out my anger on the stupidity of the world every now and then.

				Haha. I think my mom used to get fucking wild. She&#039;s never really come out and told me what all she&#039;s done, but I&#039;ve seen old pics. She was definitely a partied. I&#039;ve told her all about my experiences, minus whatever I&#039;ve IV&#039;ed because she&#039;s a nurse and I would get a lecture about some blood disease or HIV or something. So I refrain from telling her about any IV experiences.
