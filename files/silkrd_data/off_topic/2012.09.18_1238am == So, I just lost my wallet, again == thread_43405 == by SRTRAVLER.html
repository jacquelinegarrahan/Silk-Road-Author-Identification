				Was dropping my car off to get the headlights fixed and I think my wallet was in my lap and I got out of the car and it might have fallen inside the car or outside the car.&nbsp; <br /><br />Im going to go to the place in the morning when they open up so I can get the key to my car and see if my wallet is in my car and one of the workers didnt take it.<br /><br />Whats even worse I had 160 dollars cash in it, so that makes the chances of it not being returned if someone finds it.<br /><br />And this exact thing happened to me before dropping my car off at the same place. ( I found my wallet that time)<br /><br />Maybe I should stop smoking weed........My short term memory is not cool.<br /><br />I also had a check in there for 250 dollars and a gift card for 100 bux.&nbsp; FUCK man I hope it is still in my car like on the side of the seat or something like that.<br /><br />I wanna get high.&nbsp; I want take some 2c-b or some mescaline but shit I dont want this worrying about my wallet to come up in my trip.<br /><br />Someone share a joke to make me feel better?<br /><br /><br />END.<br /><br />

				I had something similar happen not too long ago. I had a hole in my pocket and the wallet just slid out and I never noticed. I spent days looking for it and gave up on it. I was more worried about having to get a new license and such than the loss of the money that was in it.<br /><br />A couple days later I got a package in the mail. Someone found my wallet and mailed it back to me, money and all. Maybe some nice person found your wallet too.<br /><br />Hope you find yours. I&#039;ll send some positive vibes your way.

				SRTRAVLER, thats sucks man. know how that goes.lets hope someone does the right thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;if it makes you feel any better, of all the times i have been on drugs and booze, at millions of gigs and raves and house parties and festivals etc.... you get the point............ the ONLY time i lost my wallet, was dead sober, at a festival, and i was the driver. how fucked is that. <br />was around the chillout area, i was looking frantic, and some kind dude came up and asked if i lost something. everything in tact.<br />keep hope hombre!

				once i lost an entire backpack full of drugs and cash and my phone at a music festival. the next day my girlfriend came running to my campsite with my backpack. some hippie found it, called my girls phone, and gave it to her. <br /><br />he didnt give her a number, or any way to get ahold of him. if i could have, i would have given him so many drugs!<br /><br />some people out there are just good like that. hopefully this is the case for you....&nbsp; :-\

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I heard of some guys lost there stuff,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mate of mine was doing a gardening job with some of his lads in Melbourne, they heard the police sirens goin off, looked up to see what was happening and as they did a car went screaming past and a brown paper bag came sailing over the hedge and landed at their feet, cops went screaming past 5 seconds later. On inspection they discovered $800 cash and 4 ounces of pot which was a pretty good find 20 years ago.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Man i wish i had all the drugs i have lost in front of me. Even just the little bits of various rock that have spit out of the spoon. One piece of beige speed rock [ but proper stuff, not like the half arsed rubbish goin in Oz] kept me goin bak to the car for like 6 months in the hope or could find it amongst all the other sand and rock and shit on the bak floor.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Used to grow a little weed in my garage, every time i harvested i would make the pledge, &#039;&#039; Stash some for when you run out&quot; but instead of being carefull i would twist em up smoke em down butt nice chunks out at the end and run out the same as always. Then about once aweek untill the next turn around i would have an epiphany, &#039;&#039; I must have stashed some&#039;&#039; start tossin the shed hunting, man i found and smoked some awfull things that might once have been herb. It worked for me once in 10 years of 5 crops a year. I had a strong desire to take some speed but had no cash, no way of getting any cash and my head was trippin when suddenly i went to my wife, i think i stashed something in the shed. Went out there real slow so as not to jinx the vibe, walked in and looked around like a Pro Drug Whisperer, went strait to the old cuppoard that i started growin in. Looked at 5 or 8 biscuit tins that had,&nbsp; herb seeds, vege seeds, poisons and stuff, picked it out on the second grasp. I fukin did it, a perfectly cured stashed 1/2 ounce of Organically grown hydro. Man i dont think i have ever had such a sweet score before or since.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, actually my first buy on this cool road was pretty sweet!!!!!<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
