				So theres this dude I&#039;ve been hanging with thats a little on the sketch side but only cuz hes one of those kids that used to do the hard stuff. I am a good judge of character and I can&#039;t believe he would do what I think might of happened. NEED HELP DECIDING NOW. My wife got up after we were done in bed to go to the bathroom and get water and I guess I passed out and woke up this morning to her alarm with her not there. 5 minutes later she comes up and said she had woke up in the spare bedroom where my &quot;buddy&quot; was sleeping. She had all her clothes on but that wasn&#039;t much at the time anyway. She can&#039;t remember shit she says and we have an AMAZING relationship so this is a huge thing and idk how to react. Wake him up with a gun? he&#039;s still asleep in the spare room. I don&#039;t wanna over do it but man I am reeling here.

				Do not wake him up with a gun, even if your intentions are moderate, you never know what might happen. <br /><br />A cheating spouse will not want to be backed into a corner and confronted directly. Out of respect for the trust you should have for each other, try asking, &quot;Is there something I should know?&quot; instead of directly accusing your partner of cheating. This way, you open up the lines of honest communication instead of putting up a wall of accusation immediately. When your partner talks, really listen. Don&#039;t interrupt her, and be sure to understand what she&#039;s saying to you. Together, you may be able to figure out a solution to solve future miscommunications.<br /><br />also read this: <br /><br />http://www.askmen.com/top_10/dating_top_ten_60/65_dating_list.html<br />http://www.askmen.com/dating/heidi/41b_dating_girl.html<br />
