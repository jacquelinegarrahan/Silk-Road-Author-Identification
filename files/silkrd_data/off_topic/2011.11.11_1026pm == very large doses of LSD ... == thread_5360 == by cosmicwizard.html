				For epic doses I prefer DMT.<br /><br />Shorter lasting but much more intense.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t already, you should try it.

				A few years ago some friends and I finished a vial in an evening. In a word, crazy. The most spiritual LSD experience was only on a few hits though, when these paintings bleed off the wall and into three dimensions, and became as if shimmering rainbow strands of some sort of cosmic DNA, which to me, in that state, symbolized the interconnectedness of all things. Fucking nuts. Closest I&#039;ve ever felt to a Higher Power, whatever you wanna call it.

				A few months ago, I took a really huge dose of L. I bought 10 doses of 180ug off SR awhile back, and took 1 and felt nothing, so I took another and felt nothing. And I&#039;ve taken plenty of L, so I know what to feel and how the rise should go. Then I noticed the baggie they were in was smeared. I won&#039;t mention the seller here because it was in no way his fault and I didn&#039;t contact him about it anyway. Sometimes things happen. But basically, a lot of the L was smeared against the bag, so I licked it and then chewed the rest. It was one of the most unpleasant experiences of my life, but I truly learned something from it and it changed many, many aspects of how I live.
