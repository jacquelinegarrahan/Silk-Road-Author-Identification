				It has been a long struggle in the war for rug freedom, but now the Equality Party is standing up for rug rights. People have walked all over them for far too long. It is time to end supremacist ideals that degrade rugs. <br /><br />Vote for the Equality Party. FREE THE RUGS!<br /><br />So far, the only states that have declared rugs free are California and Colorado, known for their liberal positions on social issues. Rugs from around the United States are moving to these states to escape the War on Rugs. Here&#039;s what one of them had to say: &quot;I am a freed rug! Praise the Lord! I am free at last!&quot;<br /><br />Freedom. Peace. Equality. <br />Do you believe in freed rugs? Share your thoughts.

				These days, rugs can be found everywhere, and it may seem like everyone&#039;s on them. Lots of people are tempted by the excitement or escape that rugs seem to offer.<br /><br />But learning the facts about rugs can help you see the risks of chasing this excitement or escape.<br /><br />Thanks to medical and rug research, there are thousands of rugs that help people. <br /><br />You will find a huge assembly of media articles documenting the death and destruction wrought by psychotic rugs.<br /><br />Proponents of rug policy reform believe that prohibition of rugs has been ineffectual and counterproductive.<br /><br />The evidence is out there!!

				I&#039;m not comfortable freeing those dirty rugs. Before you know it they&#039;ll be cruising around in hotted up cars miscegenating with our women, high on cheap nasty stain remover. I hang my rug up and beat it with a stick on a daily basis, just to show it who&#039;s boss.

				A 17-year veteran of the New York Police Department was arrested on Wednesday on charges that he was a member of a crew that robbed rug dealers of thousands of dollars in cash and rugs.<br /><br />The officer, Jose Tejada, 45, is accused of taking part in three robberies or attempted robberies in 2006 and 2007, while he was assigned to Harlem and in uniform, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday. He also supplied the crew with police uniforms, paraphernalia and police vehicles, the authorities said. He is charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to distribute rugs and unlawful use of a firearm.<br /><br />Officer Tejada, the police said, was arrested as part of an “ongoing Internal Affairs Bureau investigation.” He is the second officer with the department charged in the more than 100 robberies of rug dealers that began in 2001 and that “netted more than 250 kilograms of rugs,” according to prosecutors. He has been suspended from the department, a spokesman said.

				I know that this is an old thread, but I&#039;d like to say that I am totally for freed rugs. The majority of rugs I used to get were cut to shit or they were synthetic rugs. Thankfully through the silk road&#039;s free&#039;d rug market I can get some rugs that arent cut with a bunch of crap. I dont know why some rug dealers think its a good idea to cut their rugs up as they lose the effect of a nice clean rug. Lets all come together and bring about these freed rugs because rugs are people too! Rugs all have different personalities and they treat everyone differently. Some rugs go well with others while other rugs fight endlessly but all together the rugs are our friends. Who is the government to say who we can and cannot be friends on just because some agency says they are evil and are out to hurt us. No rugs have came to my crib looking for trouble. They only come when I invite them in. I know there are some rugs that have ruined people&#039;s lives but like with all people, you dont get along with everyone. Even those rugs that are known to be destructive on occasion, they are still someone&#039;s friend and the government has no right to take those people&#039;s friends away from them.

				Freed rugs can be a dangerous health risk in houses with stairs. Every year children, elders and cognitive impaired drunk people become victims of the rug trade. Casual (bottom of the rug pyramid, the rug buyers) users with quite normal lives but with freed rugs in their stairs sometimes slip on the rugs and fall down the stairs and injure themselves badly. Some even die when using the rugs. <br />Please think of the children next time you decide to use a rug.

				This is a disgusting thread! I can&#039;t believe our mods haven&#039;t locked this shit! You realize how many people get hurt by rugs? Children, pets, old women, and stout men have all fallen prey to rugs! You bigots with your rug propaganda are just trying to enjoy your dead-end lives when ya&#039;ll end up piled under rugs from all places -- some of them we won&#039;t even be able to identify! Might not even be a real rug but you don&#039;t care! Just as long as you can bury yourself in it and hide within the rugs and induce another rug-made haze! You let yourself get so caught up that it can end up being carpet, curtain, bedspreads...hell you&#039;d even take wood and tile you sick freaks!--it&#039;s all just another rug to you!<br /><br />I shouldn&#039;t get so upset but...I&#039;ve known good people who&#039;ve gotten into rugs...I don&#039;t even know who, or what, they are anymore. One of them thinks he&#039;s a fuckin coat rack now! <br /><br />Get out of the rug game while you still can. Because one day we all will realize it&#039;s too late.<br /><br /><br />Rugs forever
