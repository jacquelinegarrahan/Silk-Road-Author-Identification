				Hey everyone, I&#039;m usually really quiet here, just a lurker mostly but I had an interesting experience lately that I wanted to share and get some input on.<br /><br />A couple weeks ago my boyfriend and I rolled on def-qon (I hope I spelled that right, he ordered them) blue beans. I think these were reported to have about 140 mg per dose or some such. Just to give you an idea of how we took them: we took magneisum citrate and imodium to balance the gurning and divided our beans in half taking first one then taking the second half an hour later to prolong our roll. <br /><br />Firstly, let me just say these are quality product. They weren&#039;t as great in my opinion as the white speakers, lol, but they held a beauty that was all their own. On the come up, instead of that overwhelming sensation of falling I felt on the speakers I felt the most sublime sense of serenity, or zen if you will. It was simply true sublimity and the most divine experience in my life. More so than from the first time I rolled. But enough about that, on to the actual subject.<br /><br />Probably about 30 minutes to an hour after the come up I had what I perceived to be powerful psychic visions. My eyes were open but I could clearly see the vision play out in my mind&#039;s eye as it were. I saw a few things, three were into the future, two dealing with a close friend of mine who&#039;s boyfriend is abusive these weren&#039;t exactly happy she finally breaks up with him. They involved severe physical harm to her person. The third a potential sexual encounter with a colleague I have a physical crush on. (Too bad the vision didn&#039;t tell me how we go there lol!)<br /><br />The final vision I had was what I felt to be an unlocked memory. When I was very young I had an exceptionally frightening nightmare that I still remember to this day of photographs ascending into the sky next to which biographies were written. I woke screaming from the dream. Years later when the attacks in NYC happened I recognized the faces from Time Magazine. People I had never met in my entire life. On the MDMA, another part of the dream, was unlocked. Beneath these rising names were pillars of black smoke billowing the breeze with thick flames. Previously the name rose from a dark mass, kind of like the opening sequences of star wars where the words just magically appear.<br /><br />Now I consider myself relatively talented with the gift of foresight but never have I seen &#039;visions&#039; outside of say a dream or made predictions without the use of tarot or palm reading. <br /><br />So here&#039;s my theory. <br /><br />A) Since many psychics are slightly afraid of their gift they build &#039;walls&#039; or barriers to protect them from seeing too much. Since MDMA is great for removing our personal barriers that would normally protect us from otherwise frightening things. Thus because these blocks are removed, in a mentally safe environment I was able to experience a side of my gifts I was previously unable to experience. Like a war vet recounting his time in say Iraq on MDMA.<br /><br />B) I was just rolling madly and this is a very vivid albeit &#039;real&#039; experience of my imagination on MDMA. Other than that, these vision hold no water as it were.<br /><br />C) As to the dream, perhaps I really did dream that part when I was a child and because I felt secure on the use of this chemical my mind finally allowed my adult self to safely remember that horrible, horrible dream.<br /><br />D) Or my rolling self was super imposing its imagination into the dream. <br /><br />Theories aside, has any one else had psychic experiences, good or bad while rolling? Vivid vision as if you were there? Or just made predictions about say someone&#039;s pregnancy or winning the lottery? I&#039;m really, really curious about this phenomenon.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Godiva

				I&#039;ve touched on it, a little.<br />Maybe some precognition, or it&#039;s possible that I was just better able to realize a natural progression of events while rolling.<br /><br />Also, does this boyfreind know that your having visions of coworkers while rolling?&nbsp; ;)

				i gain the ability to tell time without looking at a timepiece while rolling...also i was at a rave and went from sitting to saying we need to go to this stage right now...strangely enough when i got to the middle of the dancefloor of that stage the DJ i wanted to see that night officially started his set...

				That&#039;s kind of neat actually. It doesn&#039;t matter what I take, I always have to look at a clock. Time always moves too fast for me on MDMA and on 2CE I felt like I&#039;d spent a whole afternoon in fifteen minutes. It&#039;s really weird how these substances obscure your perception of time.
