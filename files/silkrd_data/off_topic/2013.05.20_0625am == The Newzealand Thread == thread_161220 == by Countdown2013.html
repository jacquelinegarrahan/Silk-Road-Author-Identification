				The domestic market on hear is fairly small compared to most other countries but I believe it has huge potential in the variety of products and vendors that will appear in future , This thread is here to discuss all things NZ particularly new vendors , current vendors and products that are in high demand!<br /><br />I look forward to seeing this thread grow an hopefully drawing some kiwi&#039;s out of the wood work who are usually &#039;read-only&#039; .<br /><br />We may be a small community but size isn&#039;t everything ;)&nbsp;

				I believe there is already a New Zealand thread. Having correct grammar when writing your own country&#039;s name would probably help though :/

				Have recently had my first two NZ buyers. I&#039;m waiting on feedback now! There are quite a few types of postage, but a bit expensive even for basic express. However, I will be adding NZ options to all my listings from now on :) AB

				Kiwi&#039;s sure love their ganja!<br /><br />Well there are 3 weed vendors including myself , one is in stealth mode and is fairly low volume and the other is call FinestKiwiBuds and has been around for something like 9months with slightly over 100 transactions. He&#039;s legitimate but offers &#039;low&#039; prices with really expensive postage , he sometimes has multiple strains but currently is only stocking compressed brick weed .<br /><br />I am confident even his best strain cannot possibly compare to the sativa I stock . Its literally the best cannabis I have ever encountered during my existence an I have seen quite a few types :D<br /><br />I welcome competition!

Good luck to u bro, hope NZ embrace you bringing SR domestically to them&nbsp; :D

				I do honestly think my prices are reasonable , Methylphenidate for between $0.30-$0.60 per MG depending on demand , supply and Bitcoin fluctuations.<br /><br />I was doing grams of bud $14.50 but I now have the most amazing sativa buds ever which cost me more so customers pay more aswell. <br /><br />I never substitute quality for quantity although if there is enough demand for cheaper &#039;standard&#039; bud I will upload it :D

				Just a question. Why do kiwis refer to meth in mg rather than points (like in Aussie)?

				I actually meant, 1 point = 100mg. Then you have 8balls and shit.<br /><br />I have never seen anyone refer to meth in mg/grams/ounces, unless they&#039;re weighing the stuff. Then they go &#039;yeh that&#039;s 2 points&#039;.<br /><br />Was just wondering if it&#039;s some queer kiwi thing. Too much sheep pheromone or something?
