				I have used getbitcoin.com I don&#039;t know if they do international but it&#039;s not too slow. You just deposit the funds into their account and you have it in 24 hours or less

				careful using any exchanger on SR. there is no protection and users often are scammed, losing all their money because they just take it and run.<br /><br />you should not trust anyone... that was bad advice imo. dont even trust feedback on SR cause it can be faked with buyer accts that are actually the vendor. check the forums for positive reviews from established members who have conducted business obviously with the vendor.<br /><br />look into intersango.com or ways to fund mt. gox which are actual btc exchangers and you can buy them yourself for cheaper

				Go to this site and register https://bitcointalk.org/&nbsp; <br />After you make the minimum number of posts and time on the forum you can go to the MarketPlace and buy direct from many trusted sellers around the world with little or no extra fees added. <br />NEVER mention SR just say you want to buy a few bits, by far the most economical (and many times the fastest) way to buy them.
