				Meh, maybe I am out of place here but what purpose does making a bunch of threads about masturbation and &quot;man talk/no girls allowed&quot; do for anyone.&nbsp; This is a pretty awesome forum filled with MOSTLY intelligent drug users creating MOSTLY intelligent threads.<br /><br />Seems like you&#039;re trying to start 4chan type stuff when that&#039;s not what SR is.<br /><br />On the other hand maybe i just lack a sense of humor&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />

				I thought all of SR was a mans room.<br /><br />With all the sexist and homophobic language people throw around here (pussy ass bitch, pussy ass faggot, cunt, and so on) you&#039;d think the neanderthals drove out anyone who isn&#039;t a straight white male Christian ages ago.

				Hm, I wonder what the SR gender ratio actually looks like. I&#039;d bet there are actually a pretty decent number of women on here who just don&#039;t mention their genitals and everyone just assumes they&#039;re male. Allowing this male-assumption, or masquerading as a man could also be a way of protecting anonymity to some degree.&nbsp; What if it turns out DPR is a classy business lady IRL? Or if Tony76 is really some morbidly obese bitch, using her stolen funds to drink shitty Smirnoff ices and oogle banana hammocks on a private beach somewhere? What if Moonbear was a gorgeous lingerie model/international spy with a genius level IQ and playing the role of &quot;retarded high school boy&quot; was just a brilliant ploy to keep LEO off her trail? <br /><br />TL;DR: Tits or gtfo.
