				Planning my once-in-a-while k trip. I want good dubstep or stuff similiar. It&#039;s gotta be decently heavy and bassy. Weird and original works, too. Drop doesn&#039;t have to be massively intense. Preferably something I can at least preview so I can decide if I want to buy it. Somewhat newb to the dubstep scene. Heard about it when it was still reggae, then wrote it off as it evolved. I come from an industrial background for the most part. So, maybe that gives you some sort of idea.<br /><br />Oh, also for giving me advice I&#039;ll give you some advice: some of the stuff Tom Waits does (big in japan, lucinda, shake it, etc.) are surprisingly good on Ketamine and MXE. Also, if you wanna wrap up a dissociative trip or just make it a bit different, drink powerade (or anything with tons of B-12 in it [gatorade doesn&#039;t work]). I have no fucking idea why, but it does something to a dissociative trip.<br /><br />And, hey, if you&#039;ve got an out-there suggestion, go for it, too.

				Eh, not dubstep but I discovered Little Boots while on DOC and it totally made the trip, shit was a blast. Some has a lot of bass, some not so much.

				I have a feeling I&#039;m not quite as versed in dubstep as some of you guys (I like complextro and breakbeat mostly) but here are my suggestions:<br /><br />Bassnectar- also has some good DnB<br />Minnesota<br />Nero<br /><br />If you like moombahcore (people conflate dubstep and moombahcore all the time):<br />Skrillex (obviously)<br />Dilon Francis<br />Midnight Conspiracy (seriously check these guys out even if you don&#039;t like moombahcore)<br /><br />And if you like chilled out dubstep (easier listening):<br />Blackmill - this guy pretty much dominates the genre<br />Ramses B

				Old Bassnectar, nothing after 2010 is worth listening to unless it&#039;s live.<br /><br />NiT GriT, ProJect Aspect, and Kaminanda are the only dubstep artists I listen to regularly for the time being, MiMOSA is all right although his new album is garb. I also like some of The Glitch Mob&#039;s stuff, oh and Eliot Lipp.<br /><br />Some bands with occasional dub influence I like are Skeetones, The Coop, and Arpetrio and they all have free albums.<br /><br />Not Skrillex, not Nero, not Flux Pavilion, not Datsik, not Excision, not Borgore, not Rusko, not Caspa, not Skrillex, not Skrillex, not Skrillex.<br /><br />And like another dude said Shpongle is pretty legit too. Shitty DJ&#039;s who all sound the same however, are not.

Check out Leprachauns Arise, Dubuasca, Blow, Simultaneous, and Everybody (I prefer the Bassnectar vs Freq Nasty remix) from his 2005 album Mesmerizing the Ultra if you haven&#039;t, also for some amazing ass bass check out Underwater from Wildstyle EP in 2010 if you haven&#039;t, those are all my favorite Bassnectar tracks. As for Skrillex, his fan-base is another reason to hate him but I find it easy enough to dislike him just because of his sound, the artists I listed have melodies and great beats in their music, whereas with Skrillio and the others I listed it&#039;s usually just annoyingly loud and obnoxious bass lines with no real structure or a remix of some crappy song with the aforementioned effects added.<br /><br />I also like some of Love &amp; Light&#039;s songs. Structural Liberation from Galactic Booty Activation is the shit, so is Kisses. And Knight Riderz&#039; first album, 12th Dimension, was also the shit.

				Every Skrillex song sounds the exact same to me lol.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a hip hop kinda person at all, I&#039;d suggest checking out the related genre of &#039;glitch hop&#039;.&nbsp; It&#039;s bass-heavy like dubstep but more hip hop tempo rather than dubstep&#039;s typical halftime-styled 140bpm.

				I don&#039;t think every Skrillex song sounds the same, think he tapped into something wonderful and when it hits, it fucking hits man...<br /><br />Can&#039;t fault the guy for finding something consistently awesome. And it&#039;s hard to replicate, so he&#039;s doing something right.

				Blackmill is a good new dub artist, more relaxed.&nbsp; Jaytech is a favorite of mine but he&#039;s more trance but it&#039;s so relaxing.&nbsp; Everyone else has hit most of the bigger artists.&nbsp; Not so much dubstep but Porter Robinson and Mord Fustang are good as well.&nbsp; Flying Lotus, Diplo, Toro y Moi.

				Yeah Blackmill is chilled out dubstep, some people call it &quot;Chillstep&quot;.&nbsp; No joke.<br /><br />If you like a certain (sub-)genre, you should consider subscribing on Reddit to their subreddit.&nbsp; I&#039;m subscribed to the following:<br /><br />Chillstep (chilled out dubstep)<br />Electro House (do I really have to explain this one?)<br />Complextro (complex electro, that darker electro sound like Feed Me, Wolfgang Gartner, Uppermost, etc)<br />Breakbeat (I like newer breaks although most breakbeat fans seem to love the old stuff)<br /><br />A lot of people mistake moonbahcore for dubstep, too.&nbsp; A lot of Skrillex and Dillon Francis&#039;s music is moonbahcore and not dubstep.&nbsp; IMHO dubstep typically requires a wobble and a broken beat (ie not just 4x4).&nbsp; I suppose it&#039;s just splitting hairs.<br /><br />All of my dubstep recommendations have already been mentioned.&nbsp; For some hard moonbahcore (sometimes electro house) check out Schoolboy... especially &quot;Zombies Ate My Neighbors&quot; (holy shit that drop is bad-ass) or &quot;Hero Down&quot;.
