				You read the title. More points go to drugs that have softer comedowns, make you feel great, and give nice short mood and energy bursts :)<br /><br />I was thinking along the lines of cocaine (no pun intended lol), but the comedown sucks more than MDPV or meth, IMO.

				What kind of question is that? MDMA of course!&nbsp; Not much of a speeder myself.&nbsp; Sometimes I will use alcohol as a social lubricant, but I dont like to get drunk.

Well played.<br /><br />You answered your own question. Coke. Clean, non-speedy coke, if you can get it. (I know of a place...)<br /><br />I would NOT recommend railing MDMA at a party. I assume Thizzed is talking about starting the night out with it, in which case, great. But start doing molly willy nilly late into the night and you&#039;ll find yourself still rolling on Monday morning. The good (and bad) thing about coke, on the other hand, is you&#039;ll be back down in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />Though I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d call it a &quot;soft comedown.&quot; If that&#039;s what you&#039;re really after, I guess you could crush up some Xanax.&nbsp; :o

				A good pain pill is great for feel good partys, mostly the kind where your comfortable with everyone there and everyones hooking up and stuff. I like tramadol<br /><br />For partys where you&#039;re meeting loads of new people and making first impressions mdma has its good and bad points, all in all id recommend just picking a drink you like and sticking to that as youll fit in easier.<br /><br />coke is fun but again it can have the same repercussions of mdma.

It&#039;s sometimes called the MDMA of the tryptamines because of the emotional opening, increased tactile sensations and erotic feelings it causes. Despite these similarities with MDMA it feels vastly different (at least for me). It gives you a happy, sometimes giggly headspace that can change to loved-up and erotic, given the situation. The body-high is extremely speedy but at the same time much more clean and nice-feeling than cathinones, amphetamines and phenethylamines.<br />tl;dr it enhances everything where you have to be social, be it going to the movies with friends, dancing or having a good ol&#039; sexy-time.

				My vote is good cocaine, but that is sometimes hard to come by, so sometimes I will bump a a little 10mg adderall as a cheap alternative. It has somewhat of a knock-off cocaine experience.
