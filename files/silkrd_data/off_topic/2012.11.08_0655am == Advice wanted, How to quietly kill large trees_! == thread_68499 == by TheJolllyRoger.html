				Random i know....&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Well the long story short is that i live in an absolutely beautiful spot in the country and my view is obstructed by two big old trees owned by an old miserable c*** so i dont mind taking out her trees, i would also like to add im not a tree hater or view freak but you would have to see how badly these trees are. They really really take the piss!<br /><br />I have tried drilling holes in them and filling them with brass and lead to poison them to no avail, does anyone have any other realistic suggestions? Something i can do during the moonlight hours quietly!?<br /><br />&nbsp;If they die and wither a bit a storm will take them out no problem then :)<br /><br />Appreciated! And i promise to plant twenty more trees behind my own house when i take these two fuckers out!

				Ask her. Offer to pay her.<br /><br />They are not your property. You should leave them be unless you have the old lady&#039;s permission.

				Nah its been done before to no good, offers from me and my neighbors, shes just a horrible old woman, you&#039;d have to be in the situation to understand it and see it id say really, i probably sound like a right bastard haha.<br /><br />She&#039;l just be minus 2 trees that aren&#039;t even near her house and shes got plenty more they are gorgeous trees but they gotta go, they take the piss and enough is enough! Like if i owned them id have them cut down ages ago, their in the way of 15+ neighbors who had a totally different view ten yrs ago.<br /><br />Any advice anyone?

				Yea I got some advice but i don&#039;t know if it will help. If you can find some large copper nails. I mean the size of rail road spikes but longer. It has ben said that you can hammer these into the base of a tree and that would kill it. I know it&#039;s not very quiet to be hammering during the am hours tho so wait till the bitch leaves. Hell send her a letter saying she won a tv or something and to come pick it up. Tell her she won some cash but has to go somewhere like thirty miles away and pick it up then hammer that bastard full of copper or tie a chain hoist to it and break one of the biggest branches and leave it hanging. Then she may want someone to cut it down. Just say it was struck by lightening lol&nbsp; ;D

				after a storm drill a hole one inch wide and 12 inches deep and add stump remover,. ignite from a distance and watch from a distance. It should make a large hole killing the tree.

				Might &amp; Numbers of neighbours dont make that right.<br /><br />Your only way is to wait until she meets her creator..<br /><br /><br /><br />She is absolutely right to shoot u down if she sees you killing the trees!<br /><br />We understand your problem..but principles are principles.<br /><br />and BTW ..you tell to much about yourself...<br />

				I&#039;m not sure if it will work, but I would try this: drill a few holes in the trunk. Come back every night and fill them with sulfuric acid (drain cleaner). <br /><br />Drill the holes in such a way that they&#039;re pointed downwards, so that if you put liquid in them, it won&#039;t run out again.

				If anyone finds out that the trees have been tampered with you basically ask the cops to chat a little. They have cases like that everyday, and you will be one of their #1 targets. One dying tree arises suspicion, two of them beg for an investigation. Being known as the tree-killer in your community does not make your life more enjoyable. Trust me, I shot a clown one day...

				Dopamin makes a point. If you&#039;re running a drug-selling business, then I would keep a low profile and not get involved with trivial things that might draw attention to you.

				Check out what an Alabama football fan did to the trees at Auburn University.&nbsp; He put some poison on the soil and even though they are spending thousands of dollars to try to save the trees they are slowly dying.&nbsp; I think the trees are called Toomers Trees.&nbsp; Use that shit.&nbsp; I know what I&#039;m talking about.&nbsp; Look at my username.
