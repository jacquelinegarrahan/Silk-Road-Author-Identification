				There&#039;s no reason.&nbsp; They could find the server if they poured enough effort into it.&nbsp; The entire safety of Tor and its hidden services depends on there being too much traffic and too many nodes to isolate any given stream and track it.<br /><br />The US government -- perhaps uniquely since America has ended up basically controlling 75% of the internet -- has the power to do that.&nbsp; It&#039;s my opinion that nobody cares enough to bother.&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps I should say &quot;yet,&quot; or perhaps they never will.&nbsp; Who&#039;s to say.

				They probably like it for whatever reason, They might even make money off it some how (vending=revenue), who really knows. <br /><br />I am pretty sure Lolita city was hacked (not DDoS&#039;ed) i think a lone hacker published all user names or something like that a while ago and i think he was even arrested for hacking i can&#039;t for the life of me remember where i heard this though.<br /><br />Or maybe DPR&#039;s protection is truely better than any governments.<br /><br />Or maybe country&#039;s are fighting over who should fund said attack on SR, <br /><br />America: &quot;why should we do it when Germany can do it just as easily?!&quot;<br />Germany: &quot;why should German&#039;s pay for this in time and money when England should be the one doing this&quot;<br />every other government feels the same.<br /><br />Governments, US especially, doesn&#039;t have their shit right, so whatever reason they have for attacking or not attacking SR is probably way more illogical, greedy, and complicated than we can even think of.<br />

Meaning the performance of Tor will suffer for all of us. Also it isn&#039;t like taking down Lolita City or other hidden service CP sites will accomplish jack fucking shit other than to make complete idiots happy. Freenet has way more CP on it than any other network and it is virtually impossible to DDoS content on Freenet (it being hosted spread out over thousands of nodes that are not all even public knowledge). In addition to this there is also the fact that censoring CP has absolutely no positive effect at all, and objective non-government sponsored research indicates that it would lead to a spike in child molestation. <br /><br /><br />here is the story about the Dutch hacking into the CP hidden services. Note that the people who actually molested children were traced through photographic forensics (as is almost always the case) and that attacking Tor hidden services actually saved 0.0 children from abuse. This first story doesn&#039;t mention the involvement of Tor, but the second one will. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">BOSTON (AP) — The men came from different walks of life on two continents: a children&#039;s puppeteer in Florida, a hotel manager in Massachusetts, an emergency medical technician in Kansas, a day care worker in the Netherlands. In all, 43 men have been arrested over the past two years in a horrific, far-flung child porn network that unraveled like a sweater with a single loose thread.<br /><br />In this case, the thread was a stuffed toy bunny.<br /><br />The bunny, seen in a photo of a half-naked, distraught 18-month-old boy, was used to painstakingly trace a molester to Amsterdam. From there, investigators made one arrest after another of men accused of sexually abusing children, exchanging explicit photos of the attacks and even chatting online about abducting, cooking and eating youngsters.<br /><br />Authorities have identified more than 140 young victims so far and say there is no end in sight as they pore through hundreds of thousands of images found on the suspects&#039; computers. They are also trying to determine whether the men who talked about murder and cannibalism actually committed such acts or were just sharing twisted fantasies.<br /><br />The still-widening investigation has been code-named Holitna, after a river in Alaska with many tributaries.<br /><br />&quot;They are the worst of the worst,&quot; said Bruce Foucart, agent in charge of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agency&#039;s Homeland Security Investigations unit in Boston. &quot;This isn&#039;t just a child that&#039;s nude and someone&#039;s taking pictures of him; this is a child that&#039;s being raped by an adult, which is horrific.&quot;<br /><br />The case began to unfold when Robert Diduca, a Sheraton hotel manager from Milford, Mass., sent the photo of the Dutch boy to an undercover federal agent in Boston. Diduca, a married father of three who used the screen name &quot;Babytodd,&quot; thought he was sending the picture to another man with a sexual interest in babies and toddlers.<br /><br />Agents forwarded the photo to Interpol, the international police organization, and to several other countries.<br /><br />An investigator for the Dutch police recognized the stuffed bunny as Miffy, a familiar character in a series of Dutch children&#039;s books. She also traced the boy&#039;s orange sweater to a small Amsterdam store that had sold only 20 others like it.<br /><br />The boy&#039;s photo was broadcast on a national TV program similar to &quot;America&#039;s Most Wanted.&quot; Within minutes, friends and relatives called the child&#039;s mother.<br /><br />Robert Mikelsons, a 27-year-old day care worker who baby-sat the boy, was arrested. On his computer were thousands and thousands of images of children being molested and raped, including the boy holding the stuffed bunny.<br /><br />Photos and online chats found on computers owned by Diduca and Mikelsons led to more than three dozen other suspects in seven countries, including Canada, Britain, Germany, Sweden and Mexico. The oldest victim in the Netherlands was 4, the youngest just 19 days old.<br /><br />Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, whose office prosecuted Diduca, said the demand for photos of sexual assaults of young children, including babies and toddlers, has increased sharply in recent years.<br /><br />&quot;This demand leads to the abuse of children, yet there is this misconception that somehow, viewing child pornography is a victimless crime,&quot; said. &quot;It clearly is not.&quot;<br /><br />Diduca pleaded guilty to child porn and sexual exploitation charges and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. His lawyer, Richard Sweeney, said Diduca was sexually abused as a child by a Boy Scout leader. &quot;He gets it, he knows he needs to be punished, he knows what he did is wrong,&quot; Sweeney said.<br /><br />Mikelsons also received an 18-year sentence, followed by indefinite psychiatric commitment, after confessing to sexually abusing more than 80 children.<br /><br />The horror did not let up after the Mikelsons case.<br /><br />In May, authorities arrested Michael Arnett of Roeland Park, Kan., after finding pornographic photos he allegedly produced. Agents discovered the pictures when they searched the computer of a Wisconsin man who had been chatting online with Mikelsons.<br /><br />What they found on Arnett&#039;s computer was unlike anything some of the investigators had ever come across: long, graphic, online chats about his desire to abduct, kill and eat children. They said he had also made photos of a naked 2-year-old boy in a roasting pan inside his oven. The child and two other boys Arnett allegedly abused and photographed were later identified and found alive.<br /><br />In July, authorities arrested four men they say had online discussions with Arnett about kidnapping and eating children. Those arrested included Ronald Brown, a children&#039;s puppeteer from Largo, Fla. (A YouTube video shows Brown during an appearance on a Christian TV kids show in the 1980s. In the video, he tells a child puppet that he did the right thing by refusing to look at &quot;dirty pictures&quot; some other youngsters tried to show him.)<br /><br />In excerpts of an online chat between Arnett and Brown from 2011, the two men appear to be discussing their desire to cook a child for Easter.<br /><br />&quot;he would make a fine Easter feast,&quot; Arnett says.<br /><br />&quot;yes, his thighs and butt cheeks would be fantastic for Easter,&quot; Brown responds.<br /><br />A lawyer for Arnett would not comment on the allegations. Brown&#039;s lawyer did not return calls.<br /><br />Prosecutors said Brown acknowledged his online conversations but said that it was all a fantasy and that he would never hurt anyone.<br /><br />&quot;Obviously the discussions regarding their claims of cannibalism are disturbing and a concern to our agency,&quot; said ICE spokesman Ross Feinstein. He said agents are following all leads &quot;to make sure these individuals didn&#039;t follow through on any of their claims.&quot;<br /><br />To find the young victims, investigators carefully studied thousands of photos, read hours of Internet chats and worked with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. They also employed some forensic wizardry.<br /><br />After finding a video on Diduca&#039;s computer of a bound, 2-year-old boy being raped, investigators enhanced the images of furniture and carpet and determined the attack took place in a motel room in Bakersfield, Calif.<br /><br />Then they pinpointed the date by way of a TV that was playing in the background in the video, figuring out exactly when a particular episode of &quot;Family Matters&quot; aired along with a certain Pepperidge Farms commercial.<br /><br />A man from Black Forest, Colo., was arrested and is awaiting trial.<br /><br />Similarly, in the Arnett case, investigators discovered that a water bottle in one of the photographs carried the name of a swim and scuba center in Overland Park, Kan. With the help of teachers at an elementary school, they identified three children shown in the photographs, including the toddler posed in the roasting pan.<br /><br />The mother of one of the boys said she initially did not believe the allegations against Arnett, a family friend for about 15 years. She said her son, now 7, and several nephews often spent weekends at Arnett&#039;s home four or five years ago.<br /><br />&quot;Well, when we first got the phone call, we thought there&#039;s no way. You guys got the wrong guy,&quot; she said. The Associated Press does not identify victims of sexual abuse or their families.<br /><br />But then investigators showed her photos Arnett had allegedly taken of her son with a shirt and no pants.<br /><br />&quot;Regret? For sending my son with a sick-minded guy, that&#039;s the only regret I have. I had no idea,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#039;s depressing.&quot;<br /><br />For the agents working on the case, the leads never seem to end.<br /><br />Last week, they arrested another Massachusetts man after finding child pornography and photos of what appeared to be dead children on his computer. He allegedly had online chats with Arnett and Brown.<br /><br />More arrests are expected.<br /><br />&quot;The agents that work for me are extremely driven on this type of investigation,&quot; said Bart Cahill, assistant agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Boston. &quot;They really believe that they are taking out horrific violators and saving kids.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">From a photo of a toddler e-mailed in Massachusetts to a sex predator in Amsterdam, the global reach of the child-pornography trade can be seen in a case that reached Canada Tuesday, with the morning arrests of four men in Quebec.<br /><br />The Sûreté du Québec and police in Quebec City and Gatineau also executed five search warrants and confirmed that the arrests stemmed from a major child-abuse investigation in the Netherlands, where a daycare worker, Robert Mikelsons, has been charged with molesting 52 boys and 15 girls.<br /><br />Mr. Mikelsons, whose case shocked the Netherlands, was arrested after law-enforcement agents in Boston found a photo of a victim and eventually identified the child’s clothing as being of Dutch origin.<br /><br />“After Mr. Mikelsons’ arrest in 2010, the Dutch police analyzed his computer material. They found Quebeckers were among his international network. They contacted us and we began an investigation in December,” said Sûreté du Québec Sergeant Geneviève Bruneau.<br /><br />It began in the fall of 2009, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Boston were targeting a suspect who used the online name “Babytodd,” according to a criminal complaint in Massachusetts District Court.<br /><br />Babytodd chatted on forums for pedophiles, unaware that two of his interlocutors were police informants. One evening of October 2009, he e-mailed an informant a photo of a two-year-old boy whose crotch was exposed.<br /><br />The ICE agents first connected Babytodd’s Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to a downtown Boston hotel managed by 47-year-old Robert Diduca. Another IP address was linked to Mr. Diduca’s home. On Nov. 10, 2010, he was arrested and eventually convicted on child-pornography charges.<br /><br />More than 27,000 pornographic files were found on a memory card at his home, including 30 more photos and videos of the two-year-old.<br /><br />Photos of the toddler were sent to Interpol to solicit the help of other police forces. Within days, the Netherlands national police contacted the Boston agents to say that the toddler’s shirt and stuffed toy were of Dutch origin.<br /><br />A month later, Dutch television showed a cropped, sanitized photo of the boy. The toddler was identified and Mr. Mikelsons, 27, and his 37-year-old husband, Richard van Olffen, were charged.<br /><br />A statement last August by Dutch prosecutors alleged that he had been using Tor, a network that makes Web surfing anonymous by routing requests through hundreds of computers.<br /><br />The statement said police got court authorization to break into a dozen hidden websites where more than 220,000 images and videos were found. Investigators erased images where they could and elsewhere left warnings stamped with their police logo.<br /><br />A Sûreté officer said there were four arrests but five addresses were searched Tuesday because investigators weren’t able to connect the fifth location to a confirmed suspect, indicating that Dutch police provided their Canadian police counterparts with only IP addresses.<br /><br />In recent weeks, the federal government has been fiercely criticized for Bill C-30, which would compel Internet companies to provide subscriber information without a warrant when requested by police, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service or the Competition Bureau.<br /><br />Already, most major Canadian Internet providers, including Bell and Vidéotron in Quebec, voluntarily supply subscribers’ names and addresses without a court order when police investigate child abuse.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Okay so, what, if anything, can we learn from the mistakes of those pedos?<br /><br />They got busted, but they were doing everything to fly under the radar possible. The difference between us and pedos is that they know what they&#039;re doing is disgusting and wrong, we fight for freedom and are not gross animals who get off from raping (cooking, eating, killing, etc.) children. <br /><br />The one similarity between both our groups is that we do not want to get busted. <br /><br />and to LE if you&#039;re reading this (and i know ya are ;) you scumbag) go after those sick fucks and that kidnapper in Cleveland, not us!<br />

You have a lot of knowledge about child porn, where it&#039;s located, etc. You&#039;re just trying to justify your own perversion.<br /><br />Actually, censoring child pornography (the censorship could be accomplished by lone individuals or groups, not necessarily by the government) would have a good effect on society, because child pornographers are rewarded in their forum communities for producing more child pornography. They receive karma points, positive reputation, compliments, pornographic material, and even bitcoins for snapping photos of themselves fucking their daughters. So these forums encourage and reward paedophiles who abuse children.<br /><br />Being part of a community of other paedophiles also has the effect of normalisation and legitimation.<br /><br />The rate of child sex abuse is difficult if not impossible to accurately measure in any country. Most cases are unreported. This is especially true in countries like Japan where there is less awareness of child sex abuse, more respect for parental authority, etc., and so it is more likely to be unreported. Plus, correlation need not imply causation.

I believe that Russia is more likely to use Botnets for DDoSing targets than the US is. I suppose the US has used Botnets in a sense though, in the case of Stuxnet it traveled through thousands and thousands of systems before reaching its target. However, Stuxnet erased itself off machines that were not the target, their goal was to reach the targeted systems rather than to make an enormous Botnet of arbitrary infected machines. I guess I am not as certain that USA will not use Botnets as I made it sound like at first though, but it is certainly illegal for them to do so (although practically they wont care about this, Stuxnet was illegal as well) whereas Russia has a government that is much less theoretically bound by law.&nbsp; I guess though that I do not think USA will use an illegal Botnet to DDoS Silk Road. Also Russia did not officially use a Botnet either, they got the RBN to do it.

It is common knowledge that Freenet is loaded down with CP, and Lolita City is also pretty common knowledge to those who use Tor (I mean several other people in this thread suggested DDoSing it so clearly they are against it but know about it). Although I do indeed have quite a lot of knowledge about child porn, mostly stemming from reading about the technology those into it use to protect themselves, although that did lead me into reading quite a lot about those who consume it as well. I don&#039;t really feel a need to justify my &#039;perversions&#039; per-se, I am pretty comfortable with who I am and definitely don&#039;t feel like I cause anybody harm.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Actually, censoring child pornography (the censorship could be accomplished by lone individuals or groups, not necessarily by the government) would have a good effect on society, because child pornographers are rewarded in their forum communities for producing more child pornography. They receive karma points, positive reputation, compliments, pornographic material, and even bitcoins for snapping photos of themselves fucking their daughters. So these forums encourage and reward paedophiles who abuse children.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow it didn&#039;t take you long to change the subject from possession to production. This is a pretty common tactic in people who argue for child pornography censorship, because they have no good reasons for it and rather try to pretend the debate is about production. The thing is there are already legal forums for pedophiles that simply don&#039;t allow posting of pictures. Do you think that those forums should be censored as well? Nothing stops a pedophile from saying they have molested children on such a forum, and getting karma etc. Also I think it is a bit insane to think that anybody actually molests children to get + karma on a forum, although I guess there are all kinds of weird fucks out there. You seem to think it should be illegal to tell someone who has broken the law that you support them having broken the law. Should we make it illegal to say &#039;nice!&#039; when someone tells us they have sampled a rare drug? <br /><br />Also just for your information, the overwhelming majority of child pornography is traded on P2P networks like Limewire, without any social aspect at all. Only the most dedicated CP collectors join forum communities. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Being part of a community of other paedophiles also has the effect of normalisation and legitimation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So it seems you are actually for the complete censorship of all things related to casting pedophilia in a good light? No more forums for pedophiles that don&#039;t allow posting CP, etc. I am glad that you come out and say this because it clarifies that your position is one against free speech that you find disturbing. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The rate of child sex abuse is difficult if not impossible to accurately measure in any country.

Plus, correlation need not imply causation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sure the fact that there is a correlation between legalized child porn possession and decreased child sex abuse rates in every single country that it has been studied in does not necessarily imply causation. CP producers &quot;[receiving] karma points, positive reputation, compliments, pornographic material, and even bitcoins[citation needed] for snapping photos of themselves fucking their daughters&quot;&nbsp; on forums and them molesting children is also a correlation, why is it that you argue causation in this case? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Okay so, what, if anything, can we learn from the mistakes of those pedos?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />We can learn that Hidden Services are not invulnerable to hacking and that a hacking attack can easily turn into a deanonymizing attack. We can learn not to send sensitive identifying information over hidden services in plaintext, because hacking attacks can allow the attacker to gain access to that information. We can learn not to post pictures without taking extremely great care, because LE are truly fucking experts at finding the location where a picture was taken. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">They got busted, but they were doing everything to fly under the radar possible. The difference between us and pedos is that they know what they&#039;re doing is disgusting and wrong, we fight for freedom and are not gross animals who get off from raping (cooking, eating, killing, etc.) children.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A few things. First they were not doing everything to fly under the radar. Their hidden services were all using vulnerable php scripts and that is how LE was able to compromise their servers. They were communicating sensitive information in plaintext. The biggest thing that fucked them is they were posting pictures of themselves molesting children. That is the primary flaw that was exploited to deanonymize them, not attacking Tor. At least half a dozen people were arrested due to technical attacks, the remaining 50 or so people who were arrested appear to have been arrested primarily due to photographic forensics narrowing in on them. However, nobody knows exactly how many of the arrests were directly related to technical attacks. <br /><br />Second, yes most if not all of the people arrested in this case were fucked up individuals (likely sadistic psychopaths) who were molesting children. However, a great many pedophiles (who are not sadistic psychopaths) do not think what they do is disgusting or wrong, and a great many of them think that they are actually fighting for freedom in the same way as homosexuals have fought for freedom. Of course we disagree with them,&nbsp; but society also disagrees with us. Don&#039;t fall victim to mirror imaging, thinking that everybody thinks the same way as you do. To ourselves, we think that we are struggling against state oppression of drug users. Society thinks we are poisoning their children. To child molesters, they think that they are struggling against sexual oppression, society thinks that they are molesting their children. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The one similarity between both our groups is that we do not want to get busted.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />There are a great many similarities between both of our groups (child porn traders and drug scene people). We use the same technologies, we both think we are fighting for freedom, we both can show a great deal of untrue propaganda about us from the government, we both have opponents who make billions of dollars a year unsuccessfully trying to combat us, we are both demonized by society and the media, etc. From an objective point of view, society views us as quite similar indeed. The Republicans think we are both evil criminals who must rot in prisons, the Democrats think we are both sick and must be rehabilitated (and for both of us, the objective medical community falls somewhere between agreeing with the government and agreeing with us: the government claims all drug use is drug abuse but the objective medical community is against the notion that using drugs rarely and responsibly is a medical disease, the government claims that any attraction to those under the age of consent is the mental disorder pedophilia, but the objective medical community does not classify attraction to those 13+ as a disorder). We both trade in illegal contraband, objectively both sorts of trade are causing a great deal of harm to innocent people (in the case of CP obviously the children who are abused for the images, in the case of drugs the innocents who are killed by the cartel and gang wars etc). The only difference I see is that harm to innocents is inherent to the production of child pornography whereas there is not inherent harm to innocents stemming from the production of drugs. This is why I am in favor of legalizing the production of drugs, but not in favor of legalizing the production of child pornography. Short of the production level though, I see virtually no difference between us and child porn traders.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Actually there are two other important differences as well. <br /><br />1. We operate in an almost exclusively financially driven market, with customers paying for product from vendors. Child pornography collectors operate in an almost exclusively non-financially driven market, with images freely distributed.<br /><br />2. Demand drives supply in the case of drug production. Nobody would grow marijuana if not for the demand for marijuana. On the other hand, in the case of child pornography the link between demand and supply is much less established, especially in cases where there is not payment for the pornography (in cases where there is payment there is often times a clear link between demand and supply, so there are good arguments for criminalization of paying for child pornography, and certainly paying for child pornography production should be illegal). Child molestation took place prior to the existence of child pornography so it is obvious that demand for child pornography does not entirely drive child molestation.

				tldr; you&#039;re just a child molester trying to justify his perversion. I could refute all of your arguments, but what&#039;s the point? This is a personal thing for you.
