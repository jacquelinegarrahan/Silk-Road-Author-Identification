				I had my first synesthesia experience recently while on 3 mg of 25d NBOMe. It only lasted for a few minutes or so as I was coming down from the peak. It wasn&#039;t that intense , and I don&#039;t even know how to quite describe it, but it was sort of like sight and sound and touch all just got mixed up. I also had some bizarre audio distortions/hallucinations I had never experienced before (like I was pissing in the toilet, and heard it below me, and all of a sudden I heard it above me and it sounded/felt like I was pissing on my head, among other weirdness). Cool as fuck really, minus the idea of pissing on my head, lol. I&#039;ve done LSD, shrooms, weed, ecstasy, NBOMe, and spice (herbal incense type of spice, not DMT) and have never experienced anything quite like that.<br /><br />What have been your experiences with synesthesia? How intense can it get?

				I used to experiment with synesthesia in lucid dreams a lot. I&#039;ve tried every combination I could think of. The color purple tastes fucking horrible.<br />It&#039;s impossible to explain too. Another reason for everyone to learn lucid dreaming :)

				i tasted purple the first time i did LSD. i was at a underground rave in northern Israel that i found out about earlier that day. i was also drunk and had smoked some hash :) now that i really think about it, i&#039;m not sure that i did have full synesthesia, but i remember tasting purple, but have not done anything similar since :( o well, maybe it will happen again in the future :)
