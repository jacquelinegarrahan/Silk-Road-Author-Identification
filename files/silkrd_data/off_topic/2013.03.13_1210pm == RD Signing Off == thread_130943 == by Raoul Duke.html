				well friends, it was fun while it lasted, but unfortunately the time has come to say goodbye&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />obviously not going to put too many details up for security reasons:<br /><br />one of my dealers customers got busted, who grassed on my dealer, who in turn turned on me to save his own neck&nbsp; &gt;:(. luckily i&#039;m not stupid enough to keep anything in the house and thanks to a few real friends this dealer has now changed his story, and is in fact taking the brunt of the conviction (better than not being able to walk for the rest of your life i suppose) because he can&#039;t give them a name (&quot;some guy down a pub had it cheap so i bought a lot&quot;), so the case against me has dropped, but not before me getting my house ransacked and then being interrogated for quite a long time about &#039;where can someone get coke of this quality?&#039;. <br /><br />i kept my mouth shut, played dumb and was polite and considerate the whole time, luckily being in the UK i didn&#039;t get the shit beaten out of me or anything like that, actually smoked in the interview (read interrogation) room (the good cop part of the good cop/bad cop routine), by the way - coffee in the cop shop is fucking awful, and basically got away with saying this nobhead has had a grudge against me since school days and i was probably the first name that popped into his head.<br /><br />anyway, even though there has been no mention of SR, the bottom line is i&#039;ve had to chuck my SR related USB stick so my house is squeaky clean and can&#039;t reply to any encrypted messages on SR, i&#039;m writing this on a public machine just to let you guys know i&#039;m ok but i won&#039;t be back for quite a while, if at all. <br /><br />i&#039;ll pop in if/when i get chance to catch up with you guys, but looks like i&#039;m going to be stuck with buying shite off Dave for the time being. until this dealer gets out then i&#039;ll probably get done for assault with a deadly weapon. again. <br /><br />so this is the probably the last bit of waffle you&#039;ll hear from me. was good to get to know you guys, i&#039;m not listing you all but you know who you are.<br /><br />take care guys n girls, and don&#039;t trust a soul - this guy was one of my best earners and was supposedly a &#039;hard as nails, don&#039;t give a fuck&#039; kinda bloke. didn&#039;t take the cunt long to roll on me

				If I were you I wouldn&#039;t post so much information here, you pretty much have given enough info here to ID you IRL. Previous charge for assault with deadly weapon, recently interrogated by the police for coke, etc. If UK police read this they will know who you are.
