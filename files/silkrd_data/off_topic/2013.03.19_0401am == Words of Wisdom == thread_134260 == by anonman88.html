				Hello wonderful users of SR. After talking with Moonflower, we have decided to make a thread dedicated to people posting Words of Wisdom. To any users who know us, we often post quotes, that we have both come up with or discovered, with positive deep meanings. We would love for you all to contribute any quotes, or Words of Wisdom, you feel others should know. We look forward to sharing with you. <br /><br />Peace, Smiles, Love, &amp; Light,<br />-anonman88 &amp; moonflower<br /><br /><br />now, to add a quote to start this off: &quot;when you see someone carrying baggage, there are two things you can do. ignore them, letting them carry it on their own, or offer them help, so that they can get where they need to be&quot;

				” Master, Let me understand how wisdom is achieved,<br />” Sri Krishna says:&nbsp; My child, conquer your desires. - The Bhagavad Gita<br /><br />&quot;We are all of the same pure divine consciousness. Yet we view each other as separate from ourselves. <br />When we no longer view through the mind but with the heart, that is when we are witnessing reality with the eyes of the divine.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;Distinguish between those who understand and those who agree. He who understands the Teaching will not tarry in applying it to life; He who agrees will nod and extol the Teaching as remarkable wisdom, but will not apply this wisdom to his life. There are many who have agreed, but they are like a withered forest, fruitless and without shade. Only decay awaits them. Those who understand are few, but like a sponge they absorb the precious knowledge and are ready to cleanse the horrors of the world with the precious liquid.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks for this thread moonflower and anonman.
