				2 years ago I was in a long streak of a terrible depression since my teens. Not being very young anymore suicide started looking like a good option. Nothing on earth besides my family kept me alive. Searching for all types of alternatives I landed on SR and psychedelics. It took me 5 months to read about everything before I dove in. <br /><br />One purchase on SR started my life into a much positive way. In one sitting I switched from a non-stop negative person to a somewhat finally sane/happy person. It&#039;s been a year since, and I&#039;ve been getting better and discovering more about myself, all while keeping up a productive job and so on. <br /><br />SR, Vendors and Community made me really love life again. I just wanted to thank everyone that&#039;s been part of this. <br /><br />I hope we can all take this as a way to finally do more, let people know about the safety/dangers of certain drugs &amp; let&#039;s all do a bit in help to break this horrible taboo.&nbsp; If you&#039;ve talked to some of these vendors you know some of these people have great hearts and are looking to spread the love. <br /><br />We shouldn&#039;t have to be scared for the practice of trying to be happy with ourselves. So do what you can to spread awareness,love,whatever. <br /><br />Some people think DPR went full retard, and if some of these stories are true,then it sucks. But we all knew the risks. <br /><br />Help other&#039;s out. Don&#039;t let this all be for nothing. <br />

				100% agreed. Very sad day for everyone in&nbsp; the drug user community.<br />We are made out to look like some group of out of control, pathetic junkies, but we all really just want to escape from reality every now and then.<br />They give us alcohol as a legal option, but it such a shitty drug. It cannot help in the way as MDMA or LSD (and many other drugs) can.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think I had any info on there that could lead back to me, but I&#039;m so paranoid that now I&#039;m freaking out.<br />I hope this is not the end as I have thoroughly enjoyed being here the past 10 months.<br />I hope everybody stays safe and that someday we won&#039;t have to use &quot;illegal&quot; websites to buy drugs. They should all be legal.<br /><br />Take care everyone &amp; stay safe.

				Well, OP, I&#039;m glad psych&#039;s could help you out of depression...i know when I did them when I was in a low point in my life such as that, it only amplified it and mentally scarred me...I see your tryin to do a good thing and put a positive spin on this whole situation but lets be real here...psych&#039;s are not for the depressed.

				Thanks guys. <br /><br />I have been actually trying to turn friends over onto the more happier side of things, but it is very hard. You can preach of all the mind exploring,happiness, but man,people just have it sunk in their head that it&#039;s all horrible. <br /><br />Teaching and sharing isn&#039;t going to be easy by any means, but to me it&#039;s worth all the time in the world. <br /><br />Look at a few stories about people dying at concerts from bad batches or not knowing what they are getting..fucking kills me..SR showed me about vendors that cared about customers, a community that preached about drug safety, and because it&#039;s all illegal alot of people trying shit from god knows who at concerts may get bad batches from shithead dealers. <br /><br />I know I&#039;m just one person...but I am going to try to do the best I can try help break this taboo. Spread CORRECT information and so on. I&#039;d rather spend my time doing that than watching some shit TV, or reading up on the usual shithead political stuff. <br /><br />I just want to be happy,enjoy life, and I want others to be able to do the same too if they want..why is that such a bad thing? <br />

People need to fully understand that in my opinion. I wasted just about most of 20s to severe depression,threw away my entire career and got put on legal prescriptions for my depressoin that didn&#039;t do shit , all it did was make me able to deal with my shit life. <br /><br />NOW, if lets say this was all legal, and through a doctor or other pro, they could of set you up in the right mind,setting,etc and guide you on your path on getting ready. <br /><br />Psych&#039;s are not for everyone, they aren&#039;t 100% guaranteed, but let me ask you this. Would you want a doctor or therapist treating people with mind expanding psychs, or just the usual shit pharma&#039;s put out? <br /><br />

				Ok, before i leave for the last time, yeah the drugs helped me.<br /><br />They allow you to be outside of the box your living in, and turn back and look at yourself. You can see everything.<br /><br />I wont go into detail..but this government, this country..i simply have no time for anymore...i don&#039;t like where its heading..<br /><br />After a little while, it will be time to go...<br /><br />
