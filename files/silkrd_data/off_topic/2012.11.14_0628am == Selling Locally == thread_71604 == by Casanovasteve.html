				As a Silk Road user, you&#039;re in the unique position of having unlimited access to drugs you can resell, but you apparently don&#039;t have an irl network to make it work. This is, strangely enough, the exact opposite problem most dealers on the street have. <br /><br />I&#039;d recommend that you not go down this path. You need to have faith in the people you&#039;re selling to, and if you personally have to go find your customers to make a sale, your relationship with them will most likely be paper-thin. If they get busted, don&#039;t be surprised if you hear a knock on your door from LE. The likelihood of running into LE when you have to resort to selling at clubs/raves is also 100x higher. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Heh.... not gonna really comment on safety protocol and all that fun stuff....<br /><br />But as for getting customers/clientele going, easy. Get crappy throwaway jobs that complement what you&#039;re looking to sell. Fast food and restaurants for weed. Lots of stoners at Taco Bell, McD&#039;s, BK, etc.... lol. And no, not the customers, your co-workers. Size up your peers and figure out the smart ones from the dumb ones and make some solid contacts, then quit. Keep going until you have your desired customer base.

				I&#039;ve been down this road IRL and it really isn&#039;t worth the risk unless you get already have a network of people that want to buy off you. I started out because all of my friends were into it and when I was going to get mine from my dealer, they&#039;d ask me to get some for them. I&#039;d increase the price a little and then get stuff for free. Eventually more people ask and they tell their friends and that&#039;s how the network starts.<br /><br />I agree with not letting anyone coming to your house.. First thing to do also is have a cell phone that is not connected to you in anyway, that is purely for business only. You should change the sim card regularly, but being honest, I never did.<br /><br />I think you also have a bit of a fantasy that it&#039;s a really cool thing to do and all of your customers are people you deal with are cool. I was rolled by Asians with swords in a McDonalds car park whilst I was buying gear once.. and I was in my pajamas. Lost about 25k. A friend of mine used to have his house raided by a gang of dudes every couple weeks with guns (I have no idea why that idiot didn&#039;t move) and they eventually got locked up for putting some poor 20 year old bloke in the boot of a car and lit it on fire and killed him. One of the guys I mentioned earlier that rolled me, stabbed a guy in a 7-eleven car park about 3 months later and killed him and he&#039;s locked up also.<br /><br />Mine kind of spiraled out of control and I was trafficking pretty large quantities in the end though. It&#039;s always sketchy when you first start up, but seriously, it isn&#039;t worth the stress. I mainly sold pills and speed, but pretty much say goodbye to your free time and weekends. You have these drunk idiots calling you all night, and 50 people that want to meet up on a Friday and Saturday night. Driving in your car with gear too... really sketchy and meeting up at car parks and dodgy places with &#039;friends of friends&#039; and the connection is sometimes soo loose.<br /><br />But, if you&#039;re still not turned off... You need to start hanging out with people that take stuff you sell.. or work colleagues are a good source as someone suggested. It&#039;s a very slow process, but once it&#039;s rolling, it&#039;s pretty fun for a while, but the sheen does wear off. You obviously make more money off smaller amounts, but it takes longer to move. I always preferred to get rid of my stuff as fast as possible, so in the end, I only had about 3 or 4 people I used to sell to and just the odd small amounts to good friends (most of the time I gave it to them for free). <br /><br />Anyway, if you do decide, hope it all goes well for you. Best advice also is to listen to your gut a lot of the time.. If something seems dodgy.. It usually is, especially in this business.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />

				A lot of great advice in here. <br /><br />obviously, cautiousness is #1. Even friends will fuck you on money.<br /><br />So if you maybe have a hard time with stress may I suggest a different type of employment.<br /><br />Also you could always hoard drugs until you find buyers. For this option you need patience and breathing room in your account.<br /><br />In the end, $ buys food.<br />

				Never let anyone know the real place you get your drugs. Tell them you have to go to a nearby major city to get it from your &#039;dude&#039;. If you go to college, it&#039;s really simple to fall in with a group of people who will eagerly buy most anything you have. Colleges also offer a wonderful outsourcing opportunity because if you find 5 people that live in 5 different major areas around the state, the best bet is that they themselves have a group of friends back home that they can refer you too. I&#039;ve taken days to travel 2 or 3 hours out of the way to a friend&#039;s area and made a few thousand dollars in a weekend, which I think is pretty good at a pusher level. Generally, you can also find one or two people that know larger-level dealers who in turn, depending on the state of the situation, could become potential partners for large deals. <br /><br />That&#039;s the way I prefer to do business, at least. But since I go to college it&#039;s a bit easier for me. I don&#039;t look like some creepy bastard.

				As people I guess mentioned earlier, don&#039;t deal directly with the drug users themselves. If you have the opportunity to, have a few employees of your own that deal for you, and split the money between yourselves. Have them deal directly with the customers, that means you run less risk and exposure and you&#039;re generally safer that way. The problem is you could get robbed on a large deal, or by someone else figuring out what you do, that&#039;s why it&#039;s important to only work together with friends, and make sure you guys always have each others backs.<br /><br />Dealing drugs is great, I love it, I can&#039;t say I&#039;m particularly good at anything else as I&#039;m lazy as fuck. It&#039;s a good way to make money doing very little.<br /><br />Also, THIS ADVICE is important:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=71604.msg590120#msg590120">Quote from: Ooohmani on November 14, 2012, 02:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">obviously, cautiousness is #1. Even friends will fuck you on money.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve got backstabbed many times because of the almighty $, don&#039;t trust anyone, not really even your friends (well, you can trust your good friends but be wary, very wary, and don&#039;t let them hold your stash for you or your cash)<br /><br />DONT get high off your own supply. If you&#039;re gonna be addicted to your own product then you might as well forget it. That&#039;s what I&#039;ve understood so far at least, that of course depends on what product you&#039;re pushing. I wouldn&#039;t be too worried about being addicted to weed unless you&#039;re smoking far too much of it, but in general, try to stay away from the harder drugs completely if you&#039;re going to be hoarding large amounts of it. What happened to me was I ended up binging a lot of stimulant drugs and got a stimulant psychosis an it all went downhill from there. dont get high of ur own shit<br /><br />GOOD THING to REMEMBER, is that if you get 100 grams of hash for $500, and you sell them for $1250, you&#039;re going to lose $1250 if you smoke it all. When you use your own drugs, you pay THE SAME amount as you sell them for to your customers, because you lose the POTENTIAL winnings you might have earned if you sold it instead of used it yourself. It&#039;s easy to fool yourself like &quot;oh I get it so cheap that it doesn&#039;t cost me anything to smoke some myself...&quot;, well, that&#039;s not true. When you use your own product, you pay for what you lost from not selling it, so in essence, you&#039;re paying the same price per gram as your customers would.<br /><br />Also don&#039;t give anything for free for a promise of a later payment. THat shit is always a lie... can&#039;t tell you how many times I&#039;ve heard &quot;Ill pay you tomorrow&quot;.. that shit fucking grows on you and you stop taking those words seriously after a few times casue nobody who sais that actually fucking means it for real

				Although I&#039;ve never done it myself, I&#039;ve been involved with numerous friends over the years that have got into selling weed. Now first off I should point out there is usually very little profit margin on weed, most of these guys did it so they could smoke for free. Also they were all in a group of stoners at the time so the demand was already there.<br /><br />The best option is to buy in bulk then sell to people you know and trust who want to deal themselves. I know a guy that deals purely so he gets his own for free, so I could say to him that I can get him some ounces. He saves all the hassle, phone calls, driving and dodgy characters and I turn a swift profit by getting the stuff off SR and immediately selling it on to him. You&#039;ll never make scarface money that way and you&#039;re still putting trust in this guy but it removes you from 90% of the problems.<br />To run a successful operation you really need people helping that you can trust. Its at this level you run into gangs and serious operations that will take an immediate dislike to you, I&#039;ve known one guy sell 3 ounces of homegrown to a street dealer and then the dealers usual supplier forced him to give it back and then threatened the lad who sold it.<br /><br />Main points from what I&#039;ve seen people I know go through are (most of these are obvious):<br />-As mentioned in posts above its amazing how quickly even good friends can fuck each other over for easy money or drugs<br />-Start small and be humble, anyone that starts acting gangster or thinking they&#039;re scarface quickly gets a harsh reality check<br />-Keep as much separation as possible, this includes things already mentioned such as a burner/disposable mobile not in your name, not having anything where you live or certainly not having anyone know where you live or what might be there, try not to be involved in anything personally unless its necessary
