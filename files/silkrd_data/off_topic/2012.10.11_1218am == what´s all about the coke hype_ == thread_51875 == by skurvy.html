				Yeah i&#039;m not sure what the big appeal is either. Got my hands on stuff IRL about this time last year for the first time down in FL, and was told by an experienced friend user that it was great quality for what he usually gets. <br /><br />Anyways, two fat lines and I got a little buzz. Actually felt great for about 8-9 minutes, but then the itch already came to hit it again. Wow. Talk about annoying. As a meth dabbler in the past, I can tell you that a point of quality glass goes the distance of an eight-ball of coke. Hell, I&#039;d take most amphetamines sold on here or adderrall over coke. <br /><br />Maybe it&#039;s just personal preferance, but I sure wouldn&#039;t pay some of the prices for blow on SR. Hell, I&#039;ll be fine if I never come across the stuff again period.

A little talkative, but that&#039;s about it. The next time, years later, I shot it with a friend of mine. He was floored, staring at the ceiling for a few seconds before saying how great he felt. I still didn&#039;t feel it. I slowly worked my way up to roughly 3 times the size of the original dose before I finally felt it. It was nice, sort of like a 30 minute MDMA roll, but I couldn&#039;t understand all the hype. And this is coming from someone who loves uppers: Adderall, Meth, MDMA, etc. But coke was just &quot;alright.&quot;<br /><br />Everyone is different. Some people go crazy for opiates, and some think they&#039;re just &quot;alright.&quot;

				<br />For sure coke is overpriced and overhyped for what it is. I&#039;ve done high quality Peruvian flake and it wasn&#039;t all that to be honest.<br /><br />Havin&#039; said that, I&#039;m not gonna turn down a line.....I just think you get more bang for your buck from MDMA, meph and methylone.<br /><br />Coke is good if you just want a mild party vibe without having a full-on session though. I can act pretty normal on coke, but you can really tell when someone&#039;s on MDMA, so coke does have its place.

Ahoyhoy has it right. It&#039;s nice for a buzz if you&#039;re going out or just kicking back. My Drug of choice was the Original Mephedrone. I went to Coke to supplement the lack of 4-MMC after it was banned. Don&#039;t get me wrong I do like it a lot, but the prices on SR are way inflated. I have a guy StreetSide that has Premium stuff for 60/G&nbsp;

				The first two time I did it wasn&#039;t too long ago and I didn&#039;t eat beforehand.&nbsp; BIG MISTAKE.<br /><br />The first first time I did a few small lines (30-50mg every 15-20min) and just felt like I was on a lot of coffee, felt very extroverted and started talking to old acquaintances.<br /><br />The second night I went hard, did about twice as much per line and still just felt good, confident, but wasn&#039;t blown away.&nbsp; But the 2nd time I forgot to eat first...holy fuck the comedown was awful.&nbsp; I felt sick as a dog and couldn&#039;t sleep till like 5am.&nbsp; I swore it off that night...but...<br /><br />Something is still drawing me back to try it once more, I think to see if I can tame it and keep it around for the occasional party kicker, or maybe a first date in the future (for the confidence boost), I find I do talk very clearly and I&#039;m very sharp on it.&nbsp; But my only concern is the duration is leaving something to be desired, especially when you feel like complete shit not 20 minutes after it hits you.<br /><br />

				In my opinion, it&#039;s a very glamorous and upper-class drug. Even though people from all walks of life can now enjoy it. But that&#039;s how it started out, and if you&#039;re a bargain hunter and looking for the cheapest way to get as high as possible, it&#039;s not the drug for you. I love the stuff, girls LOVE it too. It&#039;s a great drug if you want to get three or four girls stuck in a bathroom with you being the only swinging dick there with them. Ahhhh good times ;)

				I like coke, and really good coke sets me off into a serious... focused intensity. I feel warm, confident, talkative, likeable, a bit edgy, smart... The thing that brings me back to coke is the memory of a feeling more than the feeling itself, I think. That &#039;feeling memory&#039; might not even be totally real, I don&#039;t know. What is real is that every once in a while the urge for blow will come to me, and it can be a pretty nagging feeling. I don&#039;t need to have it all the time, but I do get that very real feeling every once in a while.<br />That all said, there is nothing quite they same quality of shitty as paying good money for what you think is good coke, only to have feelings of speediness, etc, from cut or pure replacements. Or just total cut all together. Fuck dealers who pass off garbage as good stuff. I would much rather pay a little more money not to have my shit stepped on. The euphoric confidence that comes from good coke is awesome, but I can understand if it&#039;s not for everyone.
