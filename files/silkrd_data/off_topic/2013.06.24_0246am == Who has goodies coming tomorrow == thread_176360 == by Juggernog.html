				well also just a summary of street fest on psychedelics. Maybe It&#039;s just me, but I have never taken anything other than cannabis and opioids, so I&#039;m quite curious.<br /><br />Now that I am on the subject, where did you start? shrooms?&nbsp;

				lol Iboga/ibogaine is pretty much a broad spectrum receptor assault. Its a 5ht2a agonist (psychedelic), NMDA antagonist (dissociative), mild opioid, stimulant, and anticholinergic (delerient). Its pretty much insanity and can be dangerous but provides a very introspective mindset in which someone can have very profound and life changing experiences. You can get it here on the road but I would recommend being very experienced with psychedelics and dissociatives before jumping into something like that.<br /><br />Mushrooms are one of the best started psychedelics, as is LSD. (LSD actually seems to have less of a mindfuck than shrooms do.)<br /><br />

				LSD or mushrooms are both great choices for a first psychedelic, so is mescaline actually (from san pedro, peruvian torch, or peyote). Mescaline is actually one of the most gentle ones (bad trip is almost impossible, its just way to euphoric for it to go bad imo.) RC&#039;s can be a great trip but for the first time I would go with something more well known.<br /><br />The only really bad choices for a first trip would be ibogaine, or salvia (well not bad, just different.)<br /><br /><br />
