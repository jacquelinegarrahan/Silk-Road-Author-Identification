				It was a surprise for him to ask but he thinks I may have a thyroid issue. They have both been sent to the local hospital lab to be checked. Will they find MDMA or 2CB in my blood or urine? I&#039;d also taken Xanax and valium.<br /><br />Perhaps it&#039;s only if they are looking for these things specifically they would find them?<br /><br />Thanks.

He will check other things like the level of sodium in your urine or things like that but he will not check if you take drugs, he will probably say &quot;All is OK sir&quot; don&#039;t worry..

				Yep, just like those other two knuckleheads have said, the doc is just checking out your health which means it&#039;s not a drug test. I had the same fear when I had to give a sample to obtain my medical marijuana card, but luckily it wasn&#039;t what I expected. ;)

				It depends on his motives. If he wants to test your blood or urine for drugs he could easily do so if he felt like it. It&#039;s doubtful though, unless he suspects you&#039;re a hardcore druggie.

				Well considering you have doctor patient confidentiality I&#039;m not sure what bearing any sort of result would have upon your life. A doctor&#039;s job is too maintain your health not enforce laws. I&#039;ve told my doctor about everything I&#039;ve taken, he doesn&#039;t give a shit, it just makes it easier for him to do his job and make sure I remain healthy. :D<br /><br />-Cheers

				Assuming you&#039;re in the US, the doctor couldn&#039;t do those tests legally without your consent. Even if he did, he couldn&#039;t contact police because of doctor patient confidentiality. It&#039;s best to be strait with your doc about drug use, they are there for your health and that only.
