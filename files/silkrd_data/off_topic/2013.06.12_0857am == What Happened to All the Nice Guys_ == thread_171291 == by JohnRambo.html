				&quot;What Happened to All the Nice Guys?&quot;<br /><br />I see this question posted with some regularity in the personals section, so I thought I&#039;d take a minute to explain things to the ladies out there that haven&#039;t figured it out.<br /><br />What happened to all the nice guys?<br /><br />The answer is simple: you did.<br /><br />See, if you think back, really hard, you might vaguely remember a Platonic guy pal who always seemed to want to spend time with you. He&#039;d tag along with you when you went shopping, stop by your place for a movie when you were lonely but didn&#039;t feel like going out, or even sit there and hold you while you sobbed and told him about how horribly the (other) guy that you were fucking treated you.<br /><br />At the time, you probably joked with your girlfriends about how he was a little puppy dog, always following you around, trying to do things to get you to pay attention to him. They probably teased you because they thought he had a crush on you. Given that his behavior was, admittedly, a little pathetic, you vehemently denied having any romantic feelings for him, and buttressed your position by claiming that you were &quot;just friends.&quot; Besides, he totally wasn&#039;t your type. I mean, he was a little too short, or too bald, or too fat, or too poor, or didn&#039;t know how to dress himself, or basically be or do any of the things that your tall, good-looking, fit, rich, stylish boyfriend at the time pulled off with such ease.<br /><br />Eventually, your Platonic buddy drifted away, as your relationship with the boyfriend got more serious and spending time with this other guy was, admittedly, a little weird, if you werent dating him. More time passed, and the boyfriend eventually cheated on you, or became boring, or you realized that the things that attracted you to him weren&#039;t the kinds of things that make for a good, long-term relationship. So, now, you&#039;re single again, and after having tried the bar scene for several months having only encountered players and douche bags, you wonder, &quot;What happened to all the nice guys?&quot;<br /><br />Well, once again, you did.<br /><br />You ignored the nice guy. You used him for emotional intimacy without reciprocating, in kind, with physical intimacy. You laughed at his consideration and resented his devotion. You valued the aloof boyfriend more than the attentive &quot;just-a-&quot; friend. Eventually, he took the hint and moved on with his life. He probably came to realize, one day, that women aren&#039;t really attracted to guys who hold doors open; or make dinners just because; or buy you a Christmas gift that you mentioned, in passing, that you really wanted five months ago; or listen when you&#039;re upset; or hold you when you cry. He came to realize that, if he wanted a woman like you, he&#039;d have to act more like the boyfriend that you had. He probably cleaned up his look, started making some money, and generally acted like more of an asshole than he ever wanted to be.<br /><br />Fact is, now, he&#039;s probably getting laid, and in a way, your ultimate rejection of him is to thank for that. And I&#039;m sorry that it took the complete absence of &quot;nice guys&quot; in your life for you to realize that you missed them and wanted them. Most women will only have a handful of nice guys stumble into their lives, if that.<br /><br />So, if you&#039;re looking for a nice guy, here&#039;s what you do:<br /><br />1.) Build a time machine.<br />2.) Go back a few years and pull your head out of your ass.<br />3.) Take a look at what&#039;s right in front of you and grab ahold of it.<br /><br />I suppose the other possibility is that you STILL don&#039;t really want a nice guy, but you feel the social pressure to at least appear to have matured beyond your infantile taste in men. In which case, you might be in luck, because the nice guy you claim to want has, in reality, shed his nice guy mantle and is out there looking to unleash his cynicism and resentment onto someone just like you.<br /><br />If you were five years younger.<br /><br />So, please: either stop misrepresenting what you want, or own up to the fact that you&#039;ve fucked yourself over. You&#039;re getting older, after all. It&#039;s time to excise the bullshit and deal with reality. You didn&#039;t want a nice guy then, and he certainly doesn&#039;t fucking want you, now.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />A Recovering Nice Guy

				This whole &quot;friendzone&quot; argument is so lame, just because you&#039;re nice to a girl doesn&#039;t mean she has to fuck you. Guys do the same thing with girls who are less attractive than them, guess what? Everyone wants a good looking bf/gf&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If you&#039;re a guy who sees hot girls and wonders why they&#039;re with other good looking guys who seem like douchebags, maybe those guys are actually fun to be around because they don&#039;t whine about being &quot;too nice&quot; and &quot;friendzoned&quot;.

A girl has every right choosing the douchebag. But it&#039;s just scummy to exploit another dude&#039;s feelings for you to abuse him as an emotional outlet. You can&#039;t separate your emotional and physical needs and project them onto two different individuals because you will hurt both of those individuals to the point where they leave you. The &quot;douchebag&quot; will realize that the only real attention he gets from you is physical and the &quot;friendzoned&quot; guy will realize that he is wasting his time because he only ever gets your attention when things aren&#039;t going your way with the &quot;douchebag&quot;.<br /><br />And then you hear a girl say &quot;Where are all the nice guys?&quot; and you just want to recite this whole rant right into her face but you know she wouldn&#039;t get it anyway so you don&#039;t.

				A lot of girls like to be abused. not all but a lot. i dont get it, not my preference. the nice guys are the ones who dont treat girls like crap, but girls really dont like that, its psychological.

				With the divorce laws in America and the West so biased against men, why would any sane or intelligent man get married to a woman nowadays? Discuss. Has feminism ruined American and western women?
