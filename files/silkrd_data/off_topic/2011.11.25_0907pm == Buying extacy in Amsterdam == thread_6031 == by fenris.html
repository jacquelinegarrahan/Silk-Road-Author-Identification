				I&#039;m going to visit Amsterdam soon and I really want to go rave party and do some xtc so is it easy and safe to by extacy from the street dealers? Or is there any other way to get it? How about the quality. Are the street pills any good or fake? Anyting else I need to know?<br /><br />Don&#039;t know if this is the right place to ask but since there are many Dutch&#039;s vendors someone might know something.

				Don&#039;t trust anyone on the street, especially the closer to the centrum you are. I&#039;ve found E in Amsterdam twice and in both cases, I met people who were going to a rave and had their own sources. If you go to coffeeshops a little outside of the center, you&#039;ll find more dutch people, some of whom will use more drugs beyond weed and *might* be willing to talk to you. Whether they&#039;ll want to help you out at all (or even want you there) depends on how you act, how subtle you are when asking, and how good you are at making judgement calls. Good luck and have fun in the dam! :)

				Hi,<br />Don&#039;t worry, if you go raving near Amsterdam you&#039;ll find good stuff at the party, you&#039;ll just have to talk and sympathize with dutch people just like if you were... in a party ! If don&#039;t have a &quot;narcotourist&quot; behavior it shouldn&#039;t be too difficult ! <br />About coffee shops I was told that they are now reserved to Dutch and Belgian citizens because of new reglementations but of course it&#039;s still very easy to buy excellent weed.<br /><br />Enjoy !<br /><br />WL

				@White Light - I&#039;ve spoken with many Dutch people. I backpacked around Europe a few years ago and ended up spending a significant amount of time in the Netherlands. Amsterdam isn&#039;t really a dutch city in culture. It is an international city, where people come from all over Europe and the world and communicate in English as the primary language (almost all dutch speak English, but in Amsterdam it is the first thing you&#039;ll hear from people until you get further away from the central train station. While it is absolutely true that many Dutch hate the drug and sex tourism (and the reputation they get as a result), Amsterdam is different. The people there know they need it for their economy to thrive. The people in Eindhoven, Utrecht, Den Bosch, Rotterdam, etc - they&#039;re the ones who don&#039;t give a fuck about drug and sex tourism because their cities can survive without it. Amsterdam can&#039;t.

				Yeah don&#039;t buy on the street, don&#039;t even give the fuckers eye contact. I&#039;ve been mugged twice in amsterdam, once after politely refusing to buy coke. Striking up conversation in a club is good.&nbsp; I assumed you were american as you used &#039;xtc&#039; and &#039;rave&#039; and I was going to advise you to be discreet when asking in clubs but you appear to be from finland so you should be okay&nbsp; &nbsp;:P
