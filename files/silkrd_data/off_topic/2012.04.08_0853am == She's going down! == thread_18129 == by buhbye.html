				This site is going down faster than a heroin addicted whore at the methadone clinic. <br /><br />Not because of the owner or the system, but instead, the douche bag kids that are fucking the vendors.... well, and the vendors that are too stupid to earn money rather than steal it.&nbsp; Drug dealers are morons....<br /><br />

				If people follow protocol (escrow, solid rep) there is no reason that SR should go down. We have had a recent flux of scam kiddies, but I&#039;m thinking this will result in a flux of people resuming following the rules.

				Now vendors have the option of stealth mode. Tired of newbies scamming you? Stick with several buyers you&#039;ve dealt with in the past, and just them.

				LOL the OP is a retard&nbsp; ;D SR is clearly a lot safer than the street for many reasons. I would tell you to order something and see for yourself, but you would definitely be a shitty customer for any vendor to have. So don&#039;t.

				The only problem I see is people to put trust in the wrong hand, means to trust SR and take that as as whole. You aren&#039;t meant to trust SR other than he doesn&#039;t run away with everyone&#039;s money, for the deals in the market you must judge and always keep in mind that &quot;one vendor&quot; or &quot;one buyer&quot; are respectively &quot;one vendor&quot; and &quot;one buyer&quot;, they&#039;re not SR and they do not represent SR, they represent themselves.<br />Paythepiper got away here because people put on him the trust they&#039;ve at SR, his associate apparently hadn&#039;t succeed at another market because people have more trust on SR than BMR. This renders this weird results, one scam alone at SR most likely outnumbered all the combined scams that had happened at BMR.<br /><br />Bottom line: Regardless you trust or not in the market owner, do not put the same trust on vendors or buyers from that market, they&#039;re totally different subjects.

				What I mean is I thought that SR seller&#039;s account had an escrow feature built into them? Surely requiring 100% escrow would get around the problem of scammers provided you have proof of postage? Similarly if the product never arrives buyers are reimbursed?<br /><br />Am I wrong in thinking SR doesn&#039;t have this feature?<br /><br />V.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18129.msg182051#msg182051">Quote from: buhbye on April 09, 2012, 02:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=18129.msg181484#msg181484">Quote from: vlad1m1r on April 08, 2012, 12:18 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">How is it possible to steal - I though the vendors here operated an escrow system?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Really?&nbsp; You &quot;thought&quot; might be the problem.&nbsp; Vendors are getting ripped off....&nbsp; No sellers, no market, no market, no SR.&nbsp; Conversely, Vendors ripping off buyers, no buyers, no sellers.&nbsp; Bright point in this, you&#039;re someone I&#039;d sell too.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">OP is probably some kid that got scammed for a few bucks and now thinks the sky is falling.

				In fact, speaking of Mister Dank. Here are some examples of how I put him down. A practice I have now termed &quot;Dank Abuse&quot;. <br /><br />Dank Abuse example 1. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=17872.0<br /><br />Dank Abuse example 2. http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=5867.60<br /><br />And if that &quot;Troll&quot; was aimed at me then I&#039;m really not, he started a ridiculous argument with me over something I said as a joke and then he decided to get smart. Why should anyone take shit from anyone, especially that moron. Fuck him, if he comes looking for it, what else can he expect?
