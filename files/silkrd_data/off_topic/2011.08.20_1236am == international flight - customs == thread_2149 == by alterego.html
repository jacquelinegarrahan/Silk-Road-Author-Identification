				Send them ahead to the hotel you are staying at. That would be the safest. Or get a bottle of metamucil/bottle of hebral shit and replace herabal stuff with you good stuff. Sending them ahead is the best bet....

				can dogs smell mushrooms?&nbsp; i thought about putting those in a empty bottle of herbal vitamins, seems it would look perfect.&nbsp; unless dogs can smell them or they test the caps upon inspection (unlikely)<br /><br />the .5g mdma i figure would be easy to get through.&nbsp; still havent decided how...... many an empty gel cap full?&nbsp; but where would i put it.<br /><br />for some reason i dont trust sending them to the hotel... even though i understand the risk associated with air travel is greater.<br /><br />any other ideas?&nbsp; i figure this be the best place to ask, mon&nbsp; 8)

				Out of my limited experience flying international, it&#039;s only coming BACK to the US that you have to worry about customs or dogs.&nbsp; Unless the bahamas are big on MDMA sniffing dogs which I doubt. Probably the last thing they&#039;re thinking is they want to look for people bringing 500mg of MDMA FROM the states. They&#039;re probably more looking for the bricks of coke going the other way.&nbsp; <br /><br />All you have to do is get thru security. Just get a bottle of 1000mg vitamin C. Take the C out of the caps and put your stuff in the same ones and put them back in the bottle. Mark the hot ones very subtly. Don&#039;t just have a bottle of 15 caps cause that might look more suspicious and if they do on the .1% chance open one up they will probably just get a gram of C. The other C.&nbsp; I don&#039;t see security going thru your vitamin C to find the drugs you must have. You could even just carry all the stuff in your sock in plastic baggies so you don&#039;t have to X-ray it. <br /><br />The biggest risk of sending it to the hotel i think is the staff will take it.
