				So my bank has raised some issues about &#039;fraudulent activity&#039; about my account. <br /><br />However, I think it&#039;s just me over-spending a little on SR ^^<br /><br />What do I tell them when they ask what all these bank deposits into Intersango? <br /><br />A little worried about it due to all the hype surrounding bitcoin in the media and SR. What if they ask what kind of business I do with Intersango? <br /><br />Not sure if I&#039;m just being paranoid but I&#039;d really like some help on this guys. Just not quite sure what to do or say when confronted about it. Do I just tell them if the issue of BTC is raised that I&#039;m spending it legitly online as an alternative to normal currency?<br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m thinking too far ahead. Someone just give me some direction and what to say ^^<br /><br />Cheers guys, hope someone can give me some advice. The SR forums have not failed me yet :)

				If they are concerned about fraudulent activity that&#039;s them protecting you because they think someone got your account info and is wiring funds out.<br /><br />Just tell them that you are wiring the funds and its not fraud.&nbsp; If they want to know why, well personally I would just tell them its none of their business what you do with your money.<br />

				I have had my card blocked several times due to &quot;suspicious transactions&quot;. These transactions were to put $&#039;s on my skype account years ago. It was flagged in their system as I had never put money onto skype before. I just checked over my transaction history and called to advise all transactions I saw were fine and they unblocked my account. <br /><br />A few weeks later it happened again for the same reason and I had to call again. This time I was not so nice and asked them to stop blocking my funds with a few expletives. Never happened again. Buying BTC is not illegal so you will have no issues. Also its your money and you do not have to explain what you spend it on. If they ask, I would prob say you are buying buttplugs or fleshlights to start your own business. Then outline the benefits of both and attempt to sell the person you are speaking to one.

				Thanks for the help guys, think I just needed to stay grounded and think properly.<br /><br />Gunna go to the bank today and just essentially say &#039;ermm, hi bro&#039;s, no fraudulent activity going on, I checked. Bye.&#039;<br /><br />Hope that fixes this stuff.<br /><br />Cheers guys
