				there seems to be a lot of people after branded pharms, its mainly benzos ive been looking at, i was just wondering as there is such a massive price difference is there really that much difference in the quality of the product? for example you can get 100 clonaz from pharma1 for about 9 coins but the same amount of branded ones would be around 24 coins or so, is there really that much difference and is it worth actually paying more than twice the price, i know theyre produced in different labs and all but theyre still professional labs with the proper kit for the job not some clandestine lab so whats the verdict, im by no means an expert on pharms, if anything im just making my first steps into them so any info would be appreciated<br /><br />oh and there is one branded i do want to try, but thats just because im a big kid at heart, those roche clonazepam pictured on wikipedia with the &quot;k&quot; cut out of the middle i dont know why but i just want one! (i know, you shouldnt take drugs because they look cool, but theres no harm in making them look cool too, we get nice designs on acid blotters, actually what ever happened to blotters with a picture on each tab, i want me a god damn scooby doo!)<br />

				good discussion topic. well, starting with branding and big pharma kickback as well as physician kickback - the strength of brand name&#039;s existence is what gets people.<br /><br />obviously the latter party wants to make money, and you want to &quot;think&quot; you&#039;re getting the &quot;brand name&quot;..... here&#039;s my take.<br /><br />IMO with much experience, it is no different than a generic that has been dispensed by your pharmacist, or if not - blister packed with expiry date. generics are most often found in other <br /><br />countries when you cannot find them in the US. There are more generic producers than brand name producers by far. For this sole reason.<br /><br />On the black market, make sure it&#039;s blister packed or don&#039;t fuck with it. might as well be stamped out bathtub brew.<br /><br />~B

				Generics are absolutely fine, if the country in which they are produced has solid medicines regulation.<br /><br />In my local chemist I can buy Nurofen at £2 for 16 200mg pills, or I can buy 16 unbranded, generic 200mg ibuprofen tabs for 40p.<br /><br />It blows my mind anyone would buy the Nurofen, just as it blows my mind anyone would buy Diesel jeans for £150 too. But they do.

				It all depends on the drug, etc. When I was given generic sleeping pill It didnt do shit. I could take 2 ambien and it wouldn&#039;t make me tired. When I mentioned it to the pharmacist he replied &quot;oh, its in your head&quot; so I told him that I wanted brand name from now on. Well, a few months later that same pharmacist told me that they stopped selling a few particular generic ambiens because paitents said they weren&#039;t working. <br /><br />I then had my &quot;I told you so&quot; moment. I know that a lot of manufacturers of brand names will also manufacture the generics. In fact when I was getting adderall, when they first went generic on the ER the&nbsp; pharmacist told me that I might as well save some money and get the generic as they came from the same factory as the brand. one week they make brand, the next they make generic.<br /><br />Just like the old Teva oxycontin. They were WORTHLESS!! but give me the ABG generics any day. So, It sometimes can be a real crap shoot when getting a new generic. I usually will do my homework before jumping to a generic...

				It depends upon the drug, but generics can differ widely from the name brand. <br /><br />It&#039;s legal for there to be a difference of up to 20%, one way or the other, in what a generic gives you, vs what a name brand does. That means that on the extreme end of the scale there could be as much as 40% difference between various generics of the same drug. <br /><br />It doesn&#039;t happen often, most are pretty tight - but it can. <br />

				I get generic on all my medications because it&#039;s exactly the same. Why would they offer it if it wasn&#039;t?<br /><br />I have another ibuprofen story. In my country, our top of the range brand is $4-$6. The generic brands are $2. Paracetamol is worse; it&#039;s the same for Panadol, but generic is $0.90.
