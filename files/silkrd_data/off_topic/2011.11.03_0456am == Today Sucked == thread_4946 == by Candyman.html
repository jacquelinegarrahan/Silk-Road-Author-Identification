				I&#039;m sorry sweetie. :(<br /><br />I hope things turn around for you. <br />Every day seems to be &quot;one of those days&quot; for me, recently. I feel like I never have any money, work has been slower than it has ever been, and I&#039;m really worried that my mother (who I love very much, but have never had a very deep relationship with) is thinking of committing suicide because my stepfather recently died. I honestly don&#039;t remember the last time I felt real happiness (that wasn&#039;t drug-induced).<br /><br />Life is really really hard, but I guess all you can do is hope tomorrow will be better.<br /><br />&lt;3

				One thing after another in my life has led me to believe that the best way to get over bad feelings is by doing something good for someone else, sometimes 4 people that dont even deserve it. I been stabbed, robbed, jumped, betrayed, lost loved ones, just one thing after another but no matter what happens I get some kind of relief by doing something good 4 some1 else.

The fact that you have made it this far is a testament to your strength as an individual and if you look at the bright side, to throw the entirety of your life away would be the most wasteful thing a person could do to themselves, not only the people around them. Everyone has others who care about them. It might not seem that way all the time, but we have to think of others rather than ourselves in times of sorrow. Unfortunately, when you are down the most is the time you have to be the strongest.<br /><br />Hopefully, tomorrow will bring more joy to us all. Finding joy in times of sorrow is a great gift we all posses but must find how to use. Best wishes to everyone (and I do mean everybody in the entire world.)<br /><br />oxyhoot
