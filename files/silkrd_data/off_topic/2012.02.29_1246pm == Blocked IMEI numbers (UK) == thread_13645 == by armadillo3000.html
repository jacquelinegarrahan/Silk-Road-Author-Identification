				Hello SR,<br />any UK members of the road in the know about blocked/barred phones? I&#039;ve got a damn lot of blocked iPhones and I know you can just send/sell them abroad however I&#039;m looking for a way to get them to work here. As far as anyone seems to know IMEI&#039;s can&#039;t be changed etc etc, they also keep stating that it is illegal, so that must mean there is a way or people who know how right? so anyone have any experience with this, where should i be looking? all iPhone 4 and 4S models that have been blocked/barred by their original UK networks, talk to me SR!

				thanks but as im told any phone that had the IMEI blocked is blocked on all UK carriers and unlocking it wont change that...I don&#039;t have any of the micro sims to check this regardless, some are already jailbroken however I cant seem to find any solution from the internet, I think there must be some places that can do something about this around somewhere? I know you can find anything dodgy in london, i just dont know where to look in regards to phones!
