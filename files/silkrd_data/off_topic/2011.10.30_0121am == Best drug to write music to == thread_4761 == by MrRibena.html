				I used to love smoking weed and writing and still do, it brings out a creative side to me that I cant usually find. If you play/write, whats your drug of choice?

				Before I have found that opiates give you some concetration for composing and to play musical instrument. Its highly addictive and if you have not experiments with opiates better do not use them. Sometimes, only sometimes I found that speed (amphetamine) can give me also a lot of energy in my creativity.<br />Weed - I am not able to do anything on it - its effect me in some unusual way and I can not stand it.

				Speed can help with writing and provide the energy to make a lot of progress. For creativity, a small dose of weed or psychedelic might get your brain going. High amounts would distract or quiet your mind too much. <br /><br />Coke can work if you have enough. I don&#039;t do it anymore. Too expensive and the effects don&#039;t last long. I&#039;d spend half my time doing lines, run out in 2 hours, and have to go get more.<br /><br />On DXM I would write some crazy shit. Not music, but some could have been lyrics. Weird word associations and random memories that had nothing to do with what I was doing would pop into my head. <br />

				Surprised no one has mentioned good ol&#039; LSD. This has always put me in a state where my thoughts do not seem to get lost in the conduits of my mind. Other than that, Sativa. Indica just takes me out of it anymore. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				I like shrooms, but it gets very hard for me to function on them so I just use the trip for ideas. I&#039;ll take a dose, and as soon as I start feeling it I&#039;ll turn on a tape recorder and talk, a lot. In the morning I listen to the tape and usually have a few good things amongst the hours of rambling
