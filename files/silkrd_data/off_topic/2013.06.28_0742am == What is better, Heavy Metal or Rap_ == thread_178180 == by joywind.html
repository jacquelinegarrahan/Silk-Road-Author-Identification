				But rap hardly qualifies as music.<br /><br />Rap has little if any melody, &quot;metal&quot; does. &#039;Metal&#039; employs a lot of melody, not only in the basic vocal part, but it makes much use of other melodic elements throughout a song, in the form of interesting and original &quot;riffs&quot; or &quot;hooks&quot; which often make up the underlying structure of the song. One of the whole challenges of writing music for a metal composer is to come up with an original melody, original riffs, and original hooks. &quot;Rap&quot; shouters don&#039;t bother with these central aspects of music. The musical creativity it takes to dream up one interesting metal &quot;riff&quot; is more musical creativity than is contained in an entire &quot;rap&quot; album.<br /><br />Rap has little musical structure at all. &quot;Metal&quot; has much chordal and melodic structure. You can&#039;t even call rap &quot;musical composition.&quot;<br /><br />In &quot;metal&quot; the singers actually sing, that is, they sustain a note and follow a composed melody. In rap, the rappers just shout, nothing more.<br /><br />Metal involves a lot of technical instrumental prowess, especially on the heavily featured electric guitar. One of it&#039;s chief features is usually the technical skill of a &quot;wizard&quot; guitarist. Rap doesn&#039;t even enter this territory. It is the most moronic, simplistic music out there, and whatever instrumentation there is is unnoticeable and unfeatured, because there is nothing to feature.<br /><br />&quot;Metal&quot; also makes the full use of the drum kit and the rhythmic elements are much more complex and interesting. There is also, obviously, much more use of cymbals because there is so much more musical drama involved. There has probably never been a &quot;metal&quot; recording that employed a fake drum, i.e., a digital drum machine. It involves real drumming, by a real drummer. Often the drummer is highly skilled. And he&#039;s almost always White.<br /><br />&quot;Rap&quot; on the other hand, generally is laid over the most simplistic beat, often on a 75 dollar digital &quot;drum machine,&quot; and usually a basic 4/4 beat that a 10-year-old could have programmed in 10 minutes without using the manual. Then they usually employ a heavy and oppressive &quot;subwoofer&quot; setting for the digital/fake &quot;bass drum.&quot;<br /><br />&#039;Metal&#039; is a modern youthful offshoot of the White European musical heritage. That&#039;s why it&#039;s actually music, even though it is too loud, and I could make a lot of other complaints about it. It&#039;s also too harsh and agressive.<br /><br />But rap is offensive, not musical, to my ears. It&#039;s not in the same category. It is thugs shouting over a digital drum beat. It&#039;s less than worthless.

				I dont see how you can even put one against the other. They are 2 totally different types of music. I like both. If its good then its good no matter what Genre its labeled. <br /><br />I really dont like much of the new rap, Almost all of it sounds the same. Im a Old school BONE THUGS N HARMONY FAN!! But as far as rock an metal Old school Metallica is good also! Nicklebak even had decent music but they r far from metal.

				Dear joy wind,<br />dude , not all rap is gangsta rap. I think that not all rap is even necesarily angry. rap is poetry to music and it is used in a wide variety of ways. I like rap but dont like gangsta rap. obviously &#039;Em&#039; &#039; is probably accrited by ignaramouses as the first white rapper and argue that his subject matter is largely the same with a bit more psychopath thrown in. ICP also is a white rap group and though some of their material is gangsta a lot of it is horror core just like some metal is horror core. actually some of their more recent stuff is rap mettal which I liked a lot. then theres also nerd core and what I wanna coin as freedom core. freedom core is like politcal comentary /human condition comentary such as flobots. nerdcore includes dave from boyinaband.com , mc chris, sir frontalot. theres a really great song by nonelikejoshua I think you should look at his material. and MC chris has a kids rap album actually , beleive it or not.&nbsp; maybe your hitting on rap hate or maybe your hitting on &#039;why hasn&#039;t this been diversified&#039; . if its the former I remind you an itteration of a style does not determine the way a style must be but only the way a style can be. if its the latter I agree but think its more diverse then your aware of . <br />final answer: rap metal

				And what about De La and the Tribe? conscious hip-hop? I love it all if I DIG IT. Afro-beat, hip hop, rock, dnb, reggae, metal, jazz<br /><br />there&#039;s always one Idris Muhammed (sp) to one Kenny G in any genre of music.. Genres themselves a a defintion are IMO limiting and passe.. <br /><br /><br /><br />OP: are you trolling or is your understanding/appreciation for music so limited that you index one of our most amazing achievements as a species as a genre showdown?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;

				To get better insight on what rap is I suggest reading W.E.B.&nbsp; Dubois outstanding book, &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;&nbsp; He speaks of negro spirituals sung by slaves that carried and uplifted African Americans during their oppression in America.<br /><br />I got understanding that rap today is still basically those same negro spirituals sung back in the day of slavery.&nbsp; Rap in all its forms is raw and it tells the truth of the suffering that still goes on in African American life today!<br /><br />Stop the hate!

				Rap in all its forms is raw and it tells the truth of the suffering that still goes on in African American life today!<br /><br />thats racist, rap isn&#039;t connected to afro descended peoples any more or less then of asians. If it&#039;s rap, it&#039;s rap and genetics aren&#039;t a huge factor. <br />some rap isn&#039;t about suffering (mc chris &quot;wiid&quot; is not) so that is not definitive of the genre either. as far as rap being raw I&#039;d say that jazz and rap are at opposite ends as jazz is random and from the soul whereas rap is typically (though not always) highly produced with a computer adding multiple layers of highly designed interplay.&nbsp; I&#039;d say maybe this was meant to be taken as fecesious in order to point out how rediculous the question seems to him?&nbsp; I know that this could be construed as &quot;black vs white&quot; and say that &quot;rap is nigger music and heavy metal, evolved into the most popular whitey music from rock and roll, is (if you&#039;ll allow me to coin a term) killbilly music. &quot;&nbsp; shrug. the classification of a piece of art is subjective (to the point that a particular perspective may lable it not even subjective! :p ) meaning that who see&#039;s it is in charge of what it means to them more then the one who expresses it. this ultimately means that defining rap as &#039;nigger music&#039; is not wrong as thats exactly what it is to some perspectives BUT it isn&#039;t all that it is to every perspective and thus it being &#039;nigger music&#039; isn&#039;t necessary for it being rap. :p<br />

				Bitch I like Rap, some Metal (rarely listen to any nowadays), EDM, House,Dubstep,Trance,Trap,<br />Jazz, Rock, Classics, especially Pink Floyd, I&#039;ve even enjoyed KPOP back then in 2008 or 09 with Big Bang and the other groups, before all the <br />gay, cross-dressing, massive boy groups started showing up.<br />&gt;Inb4 Shitstorm<br /><br />There is no &quot;bad music&quot;, its all subjective.. Some music... like one artist i forgot who it was, sounded a little like Akon or it was him, and some other nigger that a taxi I was in was playing really got to me, that shit was so god damn slow, repetitive and boring as fuck imo, I just couldn&#039;t listen to anymore before my ears would start bleeding. I cant stand some of that shit, but for some people, they love it!<br /><br />I like a variety of music but I just can&#039;t stick to one genre all the time, it gets to me. And I should take back that there is no &quot;bad music&quot;, because there are some really shit bands actually.. Then again there surely is some kid around the corner who likes em..<br /><br />This thread to me was made only to gloat that OP likes Metal and is superior from Rap, which isn&#039;t true because it&#039;s different for everybody and some people listen to music like Rap which talk about money, drugs, alcohol, bitches, because they find it funny and its catchy, they don&#039;t always want to listen to some deep, meaningful, reflective song all the time, mood is a huge factor.<br /><br />When I want to mellow out there&#039;s some Pink Floyd, Some Norwegian bands (i&#039;m not Norwegian but i like international music) like Karpe Diem that I unwind to, even Thai songs god dammit.<br /><br />Listen to what you love, fuck those who think otherwise.

				Honestly, it boils down to whether you enjoy vocal talent or musical talent more for entertainment. Rap emphasizes the vocal aspect, metal emphasizes the musical. They both (usually) have both elements, but the main focus is only put toward one or the other.<br />

				http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1TBgcctcco<br /><br />listen to this and then try to wrap your brain around the idea that not all rap is gangsta rap. I think its a direct contradiction for you to say that all rap is crap then say your not against it catagorically. O.o . and you shouldn&#039;t neg karma some one for expressing an opinion particularly one I think most agree with. if you listen to something expecting not to like it and don&#039;t dig through it for something fitting to your taste then its like that south park episode where your listening to steamy ray vaughn

				I have to say I believe both are brutal, but I think that older rap (late 80s-90s) is fantastic. However, if you&#039;re asking about the current artists/bands I&#039;d rather eat crow than listen to either - they&#039;re both manufactured by the higher-ups that only care about selling an image to people that will buy the shit they spew.

				Great music is great music. <br /><br />At the end of the day the most successful and artistic Rap artists collaborate with producers who use and orchestrate live instruments for alot of the music used. In turn, majority of the great artists are essentially poets. Alot of them dont always talk about &quot;thug life&quot;. You can actually find enriching and motivating things in alot of the quality music. The problem with rap is that there are more artists on the opposite end of the spectrum that just wake up, smoke weed and talk on a beat that was made in 5 minutes on a laptop; thats not music.<br /><br />Heavy Metal takes alot more effort if you&#039;re speaking about an actual band. That is alot harder to do successfully and entails more work for the artists than rap artists. There skills are instrumental which is hands on and easier for the skill to be noticed due to it behind visual and audible. Rap, more or less, is focused on strictly lyrics so in turn great poets can cause you to visualize and feel the passion conveyed.<br /><br />Id say at the end of the day that a great rap song to me is as impressive as any genre. The rapid rates in which rap is producing wealth to an entire culture is fascinating as well if you look into the numbers.

One of the whole challenges of writing music for a metal composer is to come up with an original melody, original riffs, and original hooks. &quot;Rap&quot; shouters don&#039;t bother with these central aspects of music. The musical creativity it takes to dream up one interesting metal &quot;riff&quot; is more musical creativity than is contained in an entire &quot;rap&quot; album.<br /><br />Rap has little musical structure at all. &quot;Metal&quot; has much chordal and melodic structure. You can&#039;t even call rap &quot;musical composition.&quot;<br /><br />In &quot;metal&quot; the singers actually sing, that is, they sustain a note and follow a composed melody. In rap, the rappers just shout, nothing more.<br /><br />Metal involves a lot of technical instrumental prowess, especially on the heavily featured electric guitar. One of it&#039;s chief features is usually the technical skill of a &quot;wizard&quot; guitarist. Rap doesn&#039;t even enter this territory. It is the most moronic, simplistic music out there, and whatever instrumentation there is is unnoticeable and unfeatured, because there is nothing to feature.<br /><br />&quot;Metal&quot; also makes the full use of the drum kit and the rhythmic elements are much more complex and interesting. There is also, obviously, much more use of cymbals because there is so much more musical drama involved. There has probably never been a &quot;metal&quot; recording that employed a fake drum, i.e., a digital drum machine. It involves real drumming, by a real drummer. Often the drummer is highly skilled. And he&#039;s almost always White.<br /><br />&quot;Rap&quot; on the other hand, generally is laid over the most simplistic beat, often on a 75 dollar digital &quot;drum machine,&quot; and usually a basic 4/4 beat that a 10-year-old could have programmed in 10 minutes without using the manual. Then they usually employ a heavy and oppressive &quot;subwoofer&quot; setting for the digital/fake &quot;bass drum.&quot;<br /><br />&#039;Metal&#039; is a modern youthful offshoot of the White European musical heritage. That&#039;s why it&#039;s actually music, even though it is too loud, and I could make a lot of other complaints about it. It&#039;s also too harsh and agressive.<br /><br />But rap is offensive, not musical, to my ears. It&#039;s not in the same category. It is thugs shouting over a digital drum beat. It&#039;s less than worthless.
