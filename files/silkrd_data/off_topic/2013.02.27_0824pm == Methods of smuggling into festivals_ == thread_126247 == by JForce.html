				WTF kind of festival that you can sell at has dogs???? Do you have experience selling at festivals? Cops don&#039;t give a fucking shit about drug use and are well aware it&#039;s happening at any kind of festival where you would be able to sell. BTW if you want some info just pm me because I am an expert at getting things through security, large amounts rather than just small also.

				Well, dogs i dont know much about they dont use dogs where i used to party in Kenya, plus everyone can be bought off.&nbsp; But if youre in the white man world, i would suggest getting black runners and black orthodox, and placing it under your orthodox. However, dogs are at our knee level so they might smell it.&nbsp; Why do they have dogs..? ok they smell drugs but then you just toss them a couple dollars. I know they doesnt work in Canada but I dont think they use dogs more for explosives than for drugs. I always thought the point of festivals was to do drugs.

				I&#039;m not even planning on selling, it&#039;s just my personal stash.. Maybe I&#039;m being over cautious but I heared at the festival I&#039;m going to that there was dogs there last year.. I doubt throwing money at the police would work round here in the UK.

				Just rock up to the festival 2 or 3 hours after its opened.<br /><br />dogs only hang around at the very start of the festival<br /><br /><br />99% of the time you go to all the trouble of hiding it all, and when u get there, there is nothing there.<br /><br />Best bet is to just put it in ya jocks and walk through

				Good question :) <br /><br />Good thread.<br /><br />Let me say this: First off if your going to move mad weight, im assuming, you either have people paid off or your&nbsp; smuggling it in under your vehicle or even in massive RV&#039;s.<br /><br />I&#039;ve heard of people moving a little weight (1-3 zips of molly) and just putting it under there car (in little bins stuck to the bottom) Im not really sure how this works but the people who did it got it in fine.<br /><br />*IF YOU ONLY HAVE A LITTLE BIT (NO MORE THAN A SMALL BAGGIE OF STUFF I&#039;D SAY JUST PUT IT IN YOUR BELT/BOXER POCKET.... THEY NEVER LOOK AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO THEY DONT FIND SHIT

				Dude if you&#039;re in the UK the dogs at festivals are just for show, the amount of times I walked passed police/dogs with MDMA stuffed between my balls and penis was untrue, the dog didn&#039;t react once, never been caught. Even if you are caught with class A&#039;s just say its Ketamine and they take it off you, no further action. BTW was this the Creamfields line up? ;)

				When I went through security at camp bisco they searched everything but the people i noticed, so i just had shrooms and molly in my pocket. But here&#039;s the tricky part, if you really wanna get small ammounts in. Wear an old cast for your arm or something if you have one, they never ask to take a cast off and search it, if they do just say your doctor wont let you and walk through

				I go into the place a day or so before the festival is set up, and find an out of the way tree that I&#039;ll be able to remember my way to at a later date.<br /><br />I then bury my drugs in a small sealed container at the base of the tree. On festival day I just walk in like normal, locate my tree and pretend like I&#039;m resting against it while I retrieve my drugs.<br /><br />Thank me later :)

Metal plyers solve that easily. Quick way to get free admission and your stuff into the grounds no problem...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would absolutely NOT suggest sneaking in if you plan on vending unmentionables, unless you have a plan for getting a wristband or (preferably if you&#039;re a pro) credentials for VIP/vending/press/artist/staff/production.&nbsp; Having anyone w/ any sort of authority catch you w/o a wristband/laminate/sticky is just asking to be searched.&nbsp; <br /><br />Getting what you need into the concert area (if you&#039;re at a larger festival that has security between the stages and camping) is where things get a little more difficult.<br /><br />1. ALWAYS smile, and NEVER do anything to suggest that your time is being wasted by the 300lb dude cupping your balls in search of a flask of apple pie.&nbsp; They&#039;re working while everyone else is partying, so anything you can do to make them feel like they&#039;re a part of the party vs being the person trying to harsh your mellow helps<br /><br />2. My GOLDEN RULE is to show them you&#039;ve done this before and have nothing to hide by removing everything from your pockets (I like to throw everything in my hat and hold it in front of me), and if you&#039;re wearing a backpack have it in front of you with all the pockets open.&nbsp; If you have a hoody or something in there they&#039;re going to have to remove to search you, remove it for them and drape it over your arm.&nbsp; Anything you can do to speed up the process and show them you know you&#039;re about to get searched up and down is going to make it a lot less likely that they scrutinize your bag/pockets.&nbsp; Often I&#039;ll see the people in front of me get their shit RIPPED apart, and then when I walk up w/ everything presented in front of me ready to go I just get waved by w/ hardly even a glance into my bag.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use obvious/well-known places like your shoe, tucked in your belt, or openly in your hat.&nbsp; If you have a Grassroots hat w/ a secret pocket I&#039;d also be wary of using that, as security has caught onto that after 4yrs of that crew running around festivals lol.&nbsp; Secret pockets in backpacks, underwear, belts, shoes, etc are a good idea as long as they&#039;re well placed and well constructed.&nbsp; Don&#039;t use a pocket w/o a zipper and risk losing product just b/c it&#039;s a sly spot.&nbsp; I&#039;d suggest against using battery compartments in flashlights as they often get checked, but usually cameras are ok (make sure you have press credentials if it&#039;s a DSLR though).&nbsp; Generally security doesn&#039;t want to touch your expensive camera, but they&#039;ll rip apart the $5 flashlight you have sitting by itself at the bottom of your bag.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to refrain from going over some of my more stealth methods publicly, but just use your head and you&#039;ll be able to think of a million sly spots to stash stuff.&nbsp; If security allows flags/blow-up toys and whatnot that&#039;s a good place to start brainstorming, especially if you&#039;re trying to get something bulky in like weed.<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Who to sell to/where to sell/how to avoid LE &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br /><br />This will largely depend on your friend group attending the festival.&nbsp; Obviously it&#039;s always MUCH safer to only deal w/ friends of friends who are referred, but some people justify the risk of working w/ strangers is worth the reward.&nbsp; I generally will never mention anything to strangers, unless I&#039;ve spent a few minutes chatting w/ them already and can tell they&#039;re on the level.&nbsp; If you do decide to sell to complete strangers...<br /><br />1)&nbsp; Don&#039;t yell like many people have suggested already in the thread - feel like this should be common sense.&nbsp; <br /><br />2)&nbsp; Don&#039;t be that shirtless sweaty rolling bro that darts through the crowd super fast whispering &quot;flame molly, WoW family fluff needle point&quot; into people&#039;s ears.&nbsp; It&#039;s creepy, and it won&#039;t attract the heads who know how this system works and will make transactions run smooth, but rather the first time fest goer who was just openly yelling asking if anyone had seen their sister molly or lucy a moment ago.&nbsp; I always prefer to have a very brief conversation w/ a group of kids that look cool, and then casually ask if they&#039;re doing good on [insert whatever I have here] tonight.&nbsp; More personal interactions make people feel much more comfortable, and give you a chance to briefly evaluate your future clientele before even mentioning anything.<br /><br />3)&nbsp; For something that samples are often asked for, have a little tool (mini coke spoon, key, etc) to hand a small sample that YOU&#039;VE measured out of a bag other than the one you&#039;re selling out of.&nbsp; Do NOT just hand people you don&#039;t know gram of moon rocks and expect them not to take a point rock as a &quot;tester&quot; then not buy anything.&nbsp; Generally I just prefer to say &quot;I&#039;ll stand here while you take a dip of what you buy, and if you don&#039;t like it you can punch me in the face&quot; instead of giving out samples.&nbsp; If they&#039;re not ok w/ that, then they were probably just looking for a free dip anyways. <br /><br />4)&nbsp; As I rule of thumb I will NEVER, regardless of whether I&#039;m selling to strangers or not, do business w/ someone who approaches me.&nbsp; Instead, only work w/ those who you&#039;ve approached.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if they have dreads and are rocking some limited release flatbrim w/ GDF wings on it and a $5000 wrap around their neck - kids who know what&#039;s up are NOT going to be asking randoms for drugs at a festival.&nbsp; Undercovers are not limited to people hired to do that at the festival.&nbsp; Often LE will get kids busted to flip on others by having them run around trying to find drugs while they follow them, watch the transaction, and then bust both of you (then obviously separate you and let the other guy go w/o charges).<br /><br />5)&nbsp; Try to do the majority of your business during the day and within the camping area.&nbsp; This eliminates a lot of the undercover presence, as generally undercovers are in the concert bowl looking for dumbasses, not sitting at a campsite smoking a bowl w/ a bunch of other wooks.&nbsp; Besides, you should be enjoying your festival and getting down to music at night.<br /><br />6)&nbsp; Space out the exchange of money and drugs - do one first, wait 30sec-1min, then do the other.&nbsp; Change of hands w/ a small something followed by change of hands the opposite direction w/ a wad of cash is what LE is looking for, and they generally won&#039;t do anything if they don&#039;t see money handed off right away.<br /><br />7)&nbsp; Do NOT sell drugs at your own campsite to people you don&#039;t know.&nbsp; You don&#039;t need word getting around that you&#039;re the man in the area w/ the fire shard, and that your tent is &quot;right over there ::points at tent::&quot;.<br /><br />8)&nbsp; I would highly suggest have a cheap wirelocked safe well-hidden in a car that you can drop stacks of cash off in.&nbsp; It&#039;s not gonna stop someone who&#039;s determined, but is enough deterrent to keep your friends girlfriend from trying to pluck a couple bucks off your stack when she goes back to the car to get sunscreen.&nbsp; Putting a luggage lock on your tent is NOT going to deter anyone, so have a plan as to how money and excess product will be stashed.&nbsp; However, keep in mind the melting point of whatever you have and how hot your car is going to get.&nbsp; Also, make sure there is a backup key or two w/in your crew for when one of you inevitably loses theirs.<br /><br />9) For powder drugs, keep quantity stashed in something that absorbs moisture if it&#039;s going to be humid.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen ounces of cocaine basically ruined for the time being at festivals before.<br /><br />I&#039;ll try and update this w/ any other info I think of, and feel free to pick my brain about anything I haven&#039;t mentioned.<br /><br />Cheers! -Drippy<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				The best way to get some good amount of drug into a festival is to wear boxer briefs that are more like biker shorts, the ones people wear when they play soccer (usually tight and made of some sort of synthetic material). Then, put a regular pair of boxers over them so it looks like you are just wearing regular boxers if they pull your shirt up to look around your waste line.<br /><br />Now, the first step is packaging everything as tightly as possible- if you have weed, blotters, pills, whatever... make sure to wrap it up in a zip lock or even vac seal (this is the best method for weed).<br /><br />Next, get some duct tape or gaffing tape and put the package you made right in between your leg and where your penis+balls meet, in the upper upper area, slightly back towards you anus. Graphic, i know, but this will work 100% of the time. Basically you are putting it in an area that, even with your legs split, would require them to touch your junk. Especially with the tighter bicycle shorts/boxer briefs under your regular boxers, everything is super close to your body and will not fall out. You can even make two packages and put them on either side, just make sure to put it more towards your butt (the area in between your balls and anus) but not in the middle, just more towards it so its not facing outwards.<br /><br />This has worked for me endlessly, and I have easily brought in 10 joints, some extra loose weed, pills, blotters (easy), and anything else under the sun. Everything in the post above makes great sense too, but if you just need 5 pills and a couple of joints, using this method will make it a piece of cake. Good luck!!
