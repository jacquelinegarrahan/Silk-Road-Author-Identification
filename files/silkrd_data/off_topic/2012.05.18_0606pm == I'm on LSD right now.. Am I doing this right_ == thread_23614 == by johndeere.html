				How to know if I&#039;m doing LSD as it is supposed to be done? I&#039;m home alone, music and all.. Is this how it is supposed to feel and all? I&#039;m talking about thoughts and stuff.. It is not party drug, I know. Taken it ~4 hours ago.<br /><br />On MDMA it&#039;s more like physical high.. I&#039;m thinking would it be a good idea to add ~50-60mg MDMA in the mix now?<br /><br />P.S. This is my second time on LSD. First time was with girlfriend. She&#039;ll be home after ~40mins. Yeah, she took LSD with me but now she is against all the drugs whatsoever. Strange.

				Personally, when I&#039;m alone on any psychedelic I meditate on my music unless the experience compels me to do something such as dance or draw. Nothing I do, however, pulls me away from a solitary meditative state of mind.<br /><br />With friends, I focus on the reverse, being completely in the group rather than in myself, constantly communicating to diffuse my state of consciousness into the group as they do the same, and so we reach a common place where we may have the same thoughts simultaneously.<br /><br />Exactly what you do depends on the individual experience, but that&#039;s how I generally guide it.

				Thanks, makes sense! I thought I&#039;m experiencing something different that no one would ever experience and stuff like that... hard to explain. Guess it&#039;s how it should be.<br /><br />Tried to play a PC game &quot;From Dust&quot; where you are like god to use water, lava, earth to accomplish things...

Something like that. No brutal visuals like i have red on the internet.. out of body experiences and stuff.

				Got mine from &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;. Now I took only 1/2 of tab. It&#039;s small dose, wanted to try and feel small.<br />But for the first time (~three weeks ago) I took one tab and after about two hours another one. Then there were stronger visuals and I could not get my thoughts together, everything was floating visually, strange shapes etc. A bit like Salvia tripping from mental point of view.
