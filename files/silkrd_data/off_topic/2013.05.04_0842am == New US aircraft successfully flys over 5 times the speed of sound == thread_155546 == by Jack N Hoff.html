				The US Air Force completed a nearly decade-long test program this week with the successful launch of an unmanned aircraft into hypersonic velocity, flying at more than five times the speed of sound.<br /><br />Air Force officials announced Friday that the X-51A WaveRider flew for more than three minutes Wednesday, a one point hitting a speed of Mach 5.1, according to the Associated Press. The successful flight marked a turning point for the X-51A, which was designed with scramjet technology that’s capable of delivering weapons strikes around the world in only minutes. <br /><br />The aircraft was designed to reach Mach 6 (six times the speed of sound) but the Air Force deemed Wednesday’s flight a success because the previous three attempts either ended in highly publicized failures or failed to reach the desired top speed.<br /><br />“This test proves the technology has matured to the point that it opens the door to practical applications,” said Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, which designed the WaveRider, in a statement. He added that the flight, which saw the WaveRider travel more than 230 miles in six minutes, was “a historic achievement that has been years in the making.”<br /><br />While the immediate future for hypersonic scramjet propulsion will come in the form of faster and more effective cruise missiles, scientists have speculated that in the long term, the technology could make a London-New York passenger flight possible in under an hour. <br /><br />“I believe all we have learned from the X-51A WaveRider will serve as the bedrock for future hypersonics research and ultimately the practical application of hypersonic flight,” said Charlie Brink, program manager for the Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Directorate, in the aforementioned statement.<br /><br />Last year, when asked why such technology is necessary, Air Force officials cited a failed attempt of the life of Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 1998. Upon learning of his location, military intelligence was able summon Naval ships to fire cruise missiles at the target within 80 minutes. This new technology, the Air Force told the Los Angeles Times in 2012, would cut that response time down to twelve minutes.

Who writes the material for those &quot;Air Force Officials&quot;?<br /><br />It was your boy, &#039;Slick Willies&#039; ineptness at being &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; that is the sole reason we did not get Bin Laden in 1998. <br /><br />That info is not from a nameless &quot;Air Force Official&quot;, it is from Air Force Lt. Col Robert &quot;Buzz&quot; Patterson. Who wrote the book on Clinton&#039;s failings during those nauseating depressing 8 years. (Though they pale in comparison to the 8 year depression we&#039;re in now) <br /><br />In his book &quot;Dereliction of Duty&quot;,&nbsp; Patterson, a presidential aide and carrier of the “nuclear football,” describes President Clinton’s gross irresponsibility toward national security. Patterson tells how, in the fall of 1998, the watch officer in the White House Situation Room notified the president’s national security adviser, Sandy Berger, that they had located bin Laden and had “a two-hour window to strike.”<br /><br />Here is Patterson’s chilling account:<br /><br />Berger ambled down the stairwell and entered the Sit[uation] Room. He picked up the phone at one of the busy controller consoles and called the president. Amazingly, President Clinton was not available. Berger tried again and again. Bin Laden was within striking distance. The window of opportunity was closing fast. The plan of attack was set and the Tomahawk [missile] crews were ready. For about an hour Berger couldn’t get the commander in chief on the line. Though the president was always accompanied by military aides and the Secret Service, he was somehow unavailable. Berger stalked the Sit Room, anxious and impatient.<br /><br />Patterson continues:<br /><br />Finally, the president accepted Berger’s call. There was discussion, there were pauses – and no decision. The president wanted to talk with his secretaries of Defense and State. He wanted to study the issue further. Berger was forced to wait. The clock was ticking. The president eventually called back. He was still indecisive. He wanted more discussion. Berger alternated between phone calls and watching the clock.<br /><br />The dithering continued until it was too late–and Bin Laden lived to fight another day. And to plot the Sept. 11 attacks.<br /><br />That was not an isolated incident.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to read the book sometime. It&#039;s a quick easy read. Everything is laid out there for all to see, but because then, like now, the left wing media that puts these jokers in office, would do no investigative reporting on Clinton, just as they have never done with Obama. <br /><br />That&#039;s a great story about that unmanned crafts final flight. Don&#039;t expect a new project like that anytime soon. Obama has slashed defense spending so bad, that there are currently no R+D projects, let alone building of new defense weaponry. Unless of course it&#039;s to use against the citizens of the United States, as the Traitor in Chief, raises his conceited head high, and makes proclamations that sound ever increasingly like that of a tyrant, drunk on his own power. <br /><br />Only to steal off to some exotic expensive vacation, using Air Force I and II as their own personal &quot;His and Her&#039;s&quot; planes. Along with entourages that would make Madonna say &quot;Isn&#039;t that a little excessive?&quot;<br /><br />Great story, but I&#039;d like to hear one about how we&#039;re supposed to deal with 30 million illegal aliens being granted citizenship?<br /><br />This whole US Government is corrupt, and selling us out to the highest bidder as we sit here helpless. <br /><br />Spare a few true patriots, and they are out there. I&#039;m not happy with the Republicrats, or the Demicans.<br /><br />The ambiguity and loopholes in the Immigration Bill, along with the earmarks, and unique &#039;carve-outs&#039; for special interest groups. <br /><br />The &quot;Gang of Eight&quot; should be deported, for criminal acts against the American People, and have their assets seized unto their third generation!<br /><br /><br />NOW! <br /><br />Ask me how I really feel?<br /><br />Peace (if we only could have some)<br /><br />jagfug&nbsp; :-\<br />

				Sadly, I move further and further into the &#039;Truther&#039; light. <br /><br />I never wanted to. Just like I never wanted to believe my eyes when the Twin Towers came down.<br /><br />What do I do with this angst?<br /><br />Sometimes I feel like I&#039;m going to crack. Then, I don&#039;t. <br /><br />I just plod along with the rest of the cattle.<br /><br />Everything, is not as it seems. I know. <br /><br />It feels good to vent in the old fashioned way sometimes though. <br /><br />Thanks for indulging me.

				decent, but if you look back to the fifties or sixties or so when it was they discovered they could fly them at the speed of sound, They rapidly expanded the technology to the rate that by 2000 they had it up to around mack 4 or so, Then all of a sudden the decline in advancement has rapidly declined. I reckon they have planes going at mach 7 or so already. they just release them slowly so that other countries i.e. china cannot steal any of the information. <br /><br />I cant remember the actual specifics and timelines, however i remember researching this exact topic around 6 months ago and after around 6 google searches and frequenting technology forums for a couple of hours eeach, I came up with some very interesting information. have a look. Im sorry i really cant remember the details.
