				I&#039;m sure many of you know, there&#039;s no way to hide something from a dogs nose. If there&#039;s even the slightest particle floating through the air, he will smell it. If you&#039;ve got pounds of the non-smelliest drug in your basement, in jars, the smell will eventually permeate it, and raise through the floor, and be in your living room.<br /><br />Anyways, here&#039;s a trick to trick drug dogs.<br /><br />Drug dogs are going to go where the odor is coming from, they&#039;re going to go to the most powerful concentration of it. If you make a sort of paste, maybe drywall paste, and mix cocaine in it, or somehow imbed the odor of whatever drug you&#039;re hiding in it, and plaster it all over the walls, the dog will go crazy at your wall, and everywhere else. The police can not legal destroy your entire home because their dog is alerting all over it. <br /><br />If this odor is plastered/glued to your wall all over your house, the police have nothing they can do. They can&#039;t tear down each of your walls, because if they do, when they find nothing, they&#039;re in some deep shit. <br /><br />Here&#039;s some key things to note though. Dogs will be trained to search for drugs individually. If you they happen to be searching for weed, and you have cocaine plastered on the wall, this trick will not work, or so I presume. If you&#039;re going to have multiple drugs, you need to be a little more clever.<br /><br />Something to note:<br />I&#039;ve heard of many home raids/searches with warrants that don&#039;t use dogs.<br /><br />My friends house got raided for his brothers selling weed and MDMA. Swat team busted his door down, made everyone get on the floor, no dogs. They tore apart basic hiding places in his house. They found my friends shroomy jars that were colonizing, the initial charge was a felony but got dropped to community service since it had nothing to do with the warrant, and his record was clean, and there was no psilosin present. <br /><br />Anyways. The swat team missed tons of items. They were reckless and not the least bit throughout. They missed a vaporizer in the corner of the room, because when tearing apart the bed, the through a pillow in the direction and it hid the vape. They also missed a bowl, with weed still in it, that happen to be lying on the floor behind a clothes basket, not the least bit hidden, except from basic view. They also missed an open scale with weed crums still on it, that I believe was laying out moderately hidden.<br /><br />The swat team that came was no more than high school kids how they were described. Their language, their conduct, even their jokingness. They &#039;confiscated&#039; my friends completely legal pocket knife, because they said &quot;this has gotta be illegal too right&quot;. He never saw it again and some Swat jackass probably has it sitting on his night stand. <br /><br /><br />Needless to say, make your hiding spots clever, and they will never be revealed in the reckless rampage these swat kids call &#039;searches&#039; Think hidden compartments under floor boards. This combined with drugs hiddenly plastered on the wall and on other surfaces will make the dog unable to find your hiding spots because he will be going apeshit over the much stronger and potent drug odor you have smeared over everywhere.&nbsp; <br /><br />One tip I saw in a video is sprinkle weed stems and even bits of grinded up bud in your yard. This will make the dog go crazy. Though, if you do this, don&#039;t use a hidden floor compartment, unless it&#039;s in the center of your house somewhere hidden. The only way a cop could find it is if they removed every floor panel, not gunna happen. <br /><br />Remember, you can&#039;t hide things from a dog, but you can trick it and thwart their efforts!<br /><br />I think this same concept can be applied applied to your car when transporting drugs. Make your entire car smell! If the drug can&#039;t pinpoint the location and there&#039;s a paste with cocaine in it or something on the exterior somewhere, or even in the interior, the dog wont be able to pinpoint the location of the real drugs that have a less powerful smell. The cops are not going to get authorization to dismantle your car because your entire car is going off the radar. All you do is tell the cop that someone smoked some weed in your car or something, and he can&#039;t charge you on anything. Maybe throw some stems down. <br /><br />You know why you never hear or see any stories of people getting busted by covering their entire house with a drug odor or car with a drug odor, exterior and all? It&#039;s because they don&#039;t report failure stories on shows. <br /><br />GOOD LUCK GUYS<br />Post your tips.

				I&#039;ve heard that dogs go crazy over things like fox urine. Is that just a rumor or does it have some merit?<br /><br />If there is a substance that would make a dog go off, wouldn&#039;t that be a good ingredient in some paint or whatever to spread around your house?

				I&#039;ve heard on a different thread that powder chlorine that gets into the dogs nostril will fuck up the dogs sense of smell for a couple days. This guy claims that he sprinkles powder chlorine all over the floor of his car in case they ever bring a dog by his car..

Yes,&nbsp; I do this.<br /><br />This is a great post TommyHawk!&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; It all adds up.<br /><br /><br /><br />I get the powder chlorine from a pool store.&nbsp; <br />All it takes is a tiny amount, less than what we can smell. This is cruelty to animals technically.&nbsp; It fucks their noses for a few days. Try it sometime to urself and you&#039;ll see the effect. All you&#039;ll smell is chlorine for hours and it burns and scars your tissues.&nbsp; To a dog with 5000 x your sensitivity, it&#039;s very overwhelming.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note: If the cop figures it out, you will be charged for endangering a police officer (the fucking dog is considered a cop). Not too much or it will fuck up yur nose and be noticeable to others!<br /><br />It&#039;s cheap, easy and it works. The more he dog sniffs around , the more his nose gets burned.&nbsp; The powder is very fine like flour so it goes up the nostrils nicely.&nbsp; You need to re apply often as Chlorine seems to dissipate quickly in the exposed air. <br /><br />What do you got to loose to try it out ?&nbsp; &nbsp;Please be considerate to dogs though, if you are testing this out on your neighbors dog or whatever.&nbsp; If you see the dog snort and shake his head and back off, then it&#039;s too much. <br /><br />I learned this trick living on a farm.&nbsp; We dispose of dead animals and garbage that attract bears.&nbsp; After covering it all with chlorine powder and liquid javex, there are no more animals coming around.&nbsp; Even the crows high above the sky seem to be affected by it.&nbsp; Nobody smells the carcasses.&nbsp; &nbsp; It could just be the strong odor of Chlorine keeping them away, but either way any animal of any kind seems to not like this and run the opposite way.&nbsp; That in itself is a good thing. <br /><br />Of course if anyone smells anything , yu are busted trying to hide the smell of something else and is probable cause for a search.&nbsp; &nbsp;Use a tiny amount and the fine powder kind.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks tommy hawk .&nbsp; Your info will help me out and many others .

				Once again someone underestimating LE. Friend gets pulled over, recently had quite a good amount of illegal herb, but fortunately JUST dropped off (and apparently was snitched out). Vehicle was ripped apart, seats taken out and subsequently destroyed, then left my friend to clean up the mess. I would not put it past a dick head knocking holes in a few walls and then ravaging the dwelling due to not finding shit. Because, as we all know LE does not like to come up empty handed.<br /><br />It was a clever thought though, just not for me to use. Plus.... I would cry the entire time I applied drugs to my wall and not my nose.<br /><br />The powder chlorine tip does sound quite interesting though...

				I think a bigger issue is that they only use dogs as means of getting a warrant later.&nbsp; In other words , cops do the searching for drugs. Not dogs.&nbsp; The dogs are merely there to say, yes there are drugs here, you may now get a warrant to search that area or building.&nbsp; <br /><br />He dogs are also used for intimidation. To get confessions.&nbsp; &quot;Tell us where it&#039;s hidden, or else we will release the dog&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make it easy for us and you get a deal sort of speech.<br /><br />All the busts I&#039;ve seen in apartments and houses had no dog.&nbsp; Like you say, the smell is everywhere in a small place.&nbsp; The dog is useless. Cops already know there is drugs there.&nbsp; <br /><br />For cars, they use the dog when the driver says no o a search.&nbsp; &nbsp;They call the dog in and he comes and sniffs around.&nbsp; If he shows signs , then they are allowed to search deeper or get a warrant.&nbsp; The dog is a drug detection tool, and not a searching tool.&nbsp; Getting their precious dog in harms way sniffing Around a drug den with syringes and drugs lying around isn&#039;t to likely. It&#039;s cruelty really.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wonder how many dogs got poked with dirt syringes and sniffed up drugs while searching junkie places?<br />

				I&#039;ve just started working with my 2yr old German Shepard and it&#039;s amazing what they can sniff out. Great fun and it may yield some good information for improving packaging techniques. Maybe if I get real ambitious (and fido does well), I&#039;ll run a series of tests with different packaging and compile the data.

				Or, possibly hide behind the air filter for your central heat and air system. I would think that if the air in your dwelling is getting circulated by this, there could be no damn telling where the scent could be coming from due to air being pulled into the filter, passing your stash, then slightly dispersed through the dwelling. I would imagine that would drive the dog insane and the LE as well, considering it COULD be as simple as you just smoked a J (just don&#039;t tell them that) lol. As long as you do not have ANYTHING (paraphernalia/product) outside of that source, they would have no tangible evidence. I would definitely expect another visit though after that one, and a complete raid, down to your toothpaste tube.&nbsp; Just a thought, if someone could find flaws in that, please correct.

				Many years back my old house was raided. <br />I remeber being forced to sit outside on the sidewalk with a cop watching me. They found nothing, so I was free to go back inside. They completly destroyed my house. They ripped my bed apart, broke down walls and destroyed anything that seemed hollow. Unfortunelty they are 100% allowed to do this when they have a warrant.<br /><br />Amazingly for some weird fucking reason, they never searched the basement, which was where I had everything hidden. If it wasn&#039;t for that luck I wouldn&#039;t be posting this now.<br />And they didnt bring a dog. I kept saying why do you need to spend so much time looking, just bring a dog, my shit was vacuum sealed maybe 10 times so I knew that the dog would most likely not smell it and I would get away. I don&#039;t know how it is elsewhere in the world, but that is how it is in the United States.<br /><br />Your idea is flawed because of this. If fido starts barking at the walls they will keep ripping down walls until they find something. And if they somehow don&#039;t find something, what will happen is you just got fido decommissioned as a drug dog. They will destroy your whole house before thinking that the dog is no longer good at sniffing.

				Yep, and some LE wonder why society loathes their existence. I think the greatest thing is when you grow up with someone, party hard with them, and then they join the force and start arresting people just like themselves.... The only difference is, they gave up the illegals and start drinking on a steady.... Or at least most of them give up the illegals... Fuck a hypocritical, gun waving swine of a human.
