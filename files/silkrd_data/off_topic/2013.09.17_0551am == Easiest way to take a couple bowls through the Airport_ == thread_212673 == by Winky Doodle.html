				What&#039;s the easiest way to take a couple bowls through the airport. I&#039;m thinking of either putting it in an Altoids tin, or breaking it up and then putting it into some trail mix, or putting it in a can of chew.

				the easiest way is in your hand.<br />the safest way is not to at all.<br />the smartest way is to mail it to your destination in advance (provided you know how to do that safely)

				I&#039;ve brought weed through the airport before so I know how to package it safely, I just don&#039;t know now after all the security updates. And I can&#039;t mail it because I&#039;m only leaving for a few days. I want to know the safest easiest way to take a few bowls through a medium sized airport.

				Stick it in a condom and pop it up your bum. Cut your nails first and maybe tie a bit of cotton around the knot at the neck so you don&#039;t have to wriggle about too much getting it out. ;)

				Couldn&#039;t you just use a smell-proof baggie and sack it? I&#039;m not sure how effective they are against dogs, but if it&#039;s only a small amount of weed I would have thought a few layers of smell-proof baggies on your body would be safe. <br />But I don&#039;t really know how effective they are on dogs,<br />~D

				Another probably invalid idea that came to my head, are you allowed to bring used bongs and such abroad? If you were to hide it well enough and the dog picks it up, could you just blame the bong? ;D<br />~D

				One of my girlfriends used to tape a handful of joints underneath her breasts or along her inner thigh whenever we traveled.&nbsp; This was all pre-9/11 and before the heightened security but it never failed.&nbsp; Not too sure that would be a smart idea anymore.&nbsp; Hmmm...she was a rockin&#039; girl....I need to go make a phone call.&nbsp; Good luck!
