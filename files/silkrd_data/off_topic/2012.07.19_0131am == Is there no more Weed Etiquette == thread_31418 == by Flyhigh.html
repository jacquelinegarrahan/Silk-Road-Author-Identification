				Sorry you&#039;re missing out Flyhigh, but rest assured that my friends and I all keep up the practice, even refusing the third greens in a row as a guest to not take advantage.<br /><br />My friend gets his pieces off the clearnet now, cause local shops suck, but hey... A Sovereignty bong with an overgridded diffuser and twelve-arm perc is not something you find locally anyway. Damn I love that thing, though the peyote pillar is even better.

The video doesn&#039;t tell you what it feels like to hit it when it&#039;s filled just right, a little bit below the top of the bottom chamber. Feel free to fill it milky white, it&#039;s well designed to build up the hit, and the more smoke stays in the top chamber the smoother it is during the build.<br /><br />Then, the moment the bowl is pulled out, sharp inhale. The chamber clears almost instantly and the smoke is -pushed- into your lungs with a surprisingly smooth sensation, provided your bud was flushed, trimmed, and cured well of course. The smoke passes your throat so quickly that negligible heat is transferred, and the specialty peyote button diffuser and tube percolator make it pretty damn smooth regardless. Sovereignty pieces are truly impressive examples of scientifically mastered smoking, especially the peyote pillar as it does an excellent job of retaining taste.<br /><br />They&#039;re expensive as fuck though, some $1800-2800.<br /><br />Oh, and let me point out especially that since it clears so quickly, more lung capacity can be spent on building, and thus a larger hit can both easily be built and cleared in one go. Not to mention it&#039;s smooth enough to hold a large hit for exactly as long as you want, provided you are physically capable yourself. And isn&#039;t that exactly what we all want?

				I&#039;ve got a peyote pillar.&nbsp; It is by far the best hit a bong can bring you. Sure there are pieces out there that stack higher, but the pillar is just a straight up flavor savor.&nbsp; There&#039;s a reason this bong has gone up over $500 in value in since I bought it.&nbsp; I saw somebody call another sg piece an overgrid, kinda made me laugh, but I think you meant upgrid.<br /><br />Sad part about it is I switched to errl exclusively and I haven&#039;t hit my sg pillar in about a year...too busy with my worked sg recycler.&nbsp; :P

				While I don`t believe in a weed etiquette, I do find it annoying when someone smokes up my stash BY THEMSELVES.

My friends and I will divvy up and smoke at our own paces through separate pieces most of the day, but there&#039;s nothing like sitting in the circle and actually sharing the experience. The weed is not even the most important part - it&#039;s the sharing and togetherness. That means sharing pieces, sharing pace, sharing laughter, and genuinely enjoying the smoke.<br /><br />Personally, I love my cannabis. It keeps me from getting paranoid about the people close to me and it keeps me from spiraling into depression. It&#039;s such a widely varied plant with such a range of effects strain to strain and person to person I don&#039;t know how you can stand to not stop every once in a while and look at some bud with your friends, admiring thick trichome dusting and foxtailing and other pretty traits.<br /><br />I&#039;d be willing to bet I enjoy smoking way more than you do. It&#039;s all about respect and sincere appreciation for the experience, whether you&#039;re talking about an intimate experience with a close friend, cannabis, or lsd.
