				So two guys a couple of days ago in Sydney were gunned down in their AMG merc. They were &quot;known to police&quot; and it was hinted that the assassination was a turf war over drug distribution.<br /><br />Got me re-thinking that SR and any future online drug marketplaces are disruptive to these guys and their culture of violence. I could literally set myself up tomorrow as a vendor and as long as a postal service can be used for distribution the guys who pulled the hit could not do anything about me, my product, or my prices.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be known to the police, or known to these guys either. There is no &quot;turf war&quot; possible when buyers and sellers meet on the dark net. Their customers as well must be theirs to lose: anyone with a USB stick and some tech confidence (ie, anyone under 30) can stop talking to their local dealer.<br /><br />I&#039;m wondering how this will play out. It seems like a sea change, like the very first days of amazon entering the book market.<br /><br />Also got me wondering whether the risks of *using* SR are as much from old school dealers who don&#039;t want to see their price advantage eroded, as from LE. It seems to me equally unlikely/likely that PC Plod can find and jail a vendor as it is that Vinnie and his henchman can find and kill them. Perhaps vendors need pay more attention to backlash from trad drug distribution.<br /><br />In that sense no matter what one feels about the illegality of SR it is clearly better than street level or regional drug dealers who are prepared to murder competition on surburban streets. I wonder if LE feels that way. Does LE prefer things to remain old school? where they can get physical play with guns, cars and tazers? or do they actually prefer the business move online so they can get trained up in encryption, electronic surveillance and other high IQ tasks? my money is that LE prefer things remain brutal violent and simple.

				As long as this online shit stays safe, it will change the drug world big time !<br />Gangs will come online as well, but they are way behind. so im really curious how this will play out too.<br /><br />I heard there&#039;s already a cocaine-cartell in SA which accepts BTC :D Hilarious, aint it ?

				The commerce of the SR supports pure capitalism and it makes vendors compete on a global scale which is perfect for the consumer unlike dealers on the street that only have to compete with people close by and instead of being businessmen who use price and product to get customers they claim land as their own and fight for it like barbarians

It is certainly better for the buyer than the street considering that you could read reviews and pick vendors carefully, but as evidenced from the LSD market on SR right now, it still isn&#039;t that good. There are scammers and opportunists. People see demand is high but supply is low so they play upon people&#039;s hopes, either sending them bunk shit, weak shit or overpriced shit.

				Fuck the old school. In the ass. Hard.<br /><br />Whatever way you buy your drugs though, some poor bastard still had to smuggle it in his anus across someones border and wipe the poo off before it went into your mouth / nose / arm. <br /><br />Think about it. <br /><br />Actually, don&#039;t.
