				In the case one of our fellow peers gets his ass substantially handed to him evidence-wise, can being able to afford the highest quality of narcotics defense really make a dent even if they wanted you badly?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />This is more related to the recent OVDB vendor ene busted but applies to all of us.&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of us don&#039;t have a legal team prepared when entering business.&nbsp; It is definitely a smart idea when running any kind of business to have this concern at least covered.<br /><br />

				LMFAO, of course having highly paid lawyers will get you out of shit.&nbsp; Look at O.J. for example.<br /><br />If ene could of spent his $125k on a legal team, they would of already gotten him off.&nbsp; Judges don&#039;t take kindly to cops thinking they can operate above the law.&nbsp; Think about it, every judge in America likely started as a lowly attorney, then moved their way up over years and years of hard work and long hours...<br /><br />If anyone considers vending, it&#039;d be very unwise to not have a lawyer on retainer.&nbsp; Hell I have one and don&#039;t even vend...&nbsp; Always nice for that first call to be someone that WILL get you out of the trouble, not just out of jail.<br />

				Yes and no. My boy got in trouble for a paraphernalia charge (got pulled over with some friends) and got it knocked down to 20 hours community service. Keep in mind he had cultivation on his record. He had to pay the attorney $2000 which is what really got him to be really good at selling methylone because he had some motivation. Now hes made 20k and has a new car. <br /><br />It was the same attorney his parents hired for him when he got a marijuana cultivation charge and he only got a year of probo. <br /><br />BUT HAHA if you think an attorney can get you out of a felony than you got another thing coming, they can just really really get it down.

				&quot;high class lawyers&quot; is and oxymoron, ha.&nbsp; Let just say, I&#039;m very familiar with this subject. <br /><br />Anyhow, 60 % of cases are dropped, while 90% of the remaining 40% plead out... it&#039;s called judicial economy. Prosecutors carry 400-500 cases simultaneously, they simply cannot justify the cost of prosecution and meet the 6th Amendment guarantees.&nbsp; <br /><br />To the original point, the more reputable the attorney, the more likely the state will offer a better plea bargain rather than battle a bulldog defense attorney in a protracted and expensive trial.&nbsp; It&#039;s a common strategy.&nbsp; So, yea, quality defense attorney&#039;s are helpful.&nbsp; But it really depends on the stupidity of the accused.&nbsp; Take this to heart:&nbsp; you are NEVER required to talk without an attorney.&nbsp; That is, keep your fucking mouth shut.<br /><br />&quot;Judges don&#039;t take kindly to cops thinking they can operate above the law.&nbsp; Think about it, every judge in America likely started as a lowly attorney, then moved their way up over years and years of hard work and long hours..&quot;<br /><br />A majority of Judges and Lawyers despise cops.&nbsp; They are illiterate, morons.&nbsp; Think about it, if you have a GED and a somewhat uncheckered past, you&#039;re qualified - give them a gun and some power. These dumb-asses rarely write a coherent sentence grounded in fact, rather they excel at useless conclusory assertions.&nbsp; Most cases are kicked because they cannot write a factual account of the crime. <br /><br />While I&#039;m on a role... read Arizona v. Gant, 129 S.Ct. 1710 (2009).&nbsp; The Supreme Court held, inter alia, that Police may search a vehicle incident to a recent occupant&#039;s arrest only if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search or it is reasonable to believe the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest, and when these justifications are absent, a search of an arrestee&#039;s vehicle will be unreasonable unless police obtain a warrant or show that another exception to the warrant requirement applies. U.S.C.A. Const. Amend. 4.<br /><br />Moral of the story, if you must drive with drugs, keep them outside an arms reach, preferably in a locked glove compartment or back seat in a container.&nbsp; Neither consent to search nor waiver Miranda because if you&#039;re pulled over for a traffic offense (pretextual stop), it is unlwaful&nbsp; to search incident to arrest unless you fall under a very narrowly drawn exceptions, e.g. you&#039;re present an threat to the officers safety, or you are stopped for the drugs in the car - which in nearly impossible. <br /><br />The reason I write this is because of how this case got to the supreme court, in relation to a few of the comment above.&nbsp; &quot;Among other things, Gant argued that Belton did not authorize the search of his vehicle because he posed no threat to the officers after he was handcuffed in the patrol car and because he was arrested for a traffic offense for which no evidence could be found in his vehicle. When asked at the suppression hearing why the search was conducted, Officer Griffith responded: “Because the law says we can do it.”<br /><br />Don&#039;t tell the court what the law is....&nbsp; I doubt he&#039;s no longer a cop, just a guess.

				usually, big time lawyers are well known to all the local judges. The judges know that the good attorney will use every law to their advantage. the judge wants it off his desk as fast as possible (usually). So, when he sees a high powered attorney, deals go a lot smoother.<br /><br />I had a close relative that got popped shoplifting and couldnt afford a lawyer and had to have a public defender (btw, dont ever use them,beg or borrow the money for an attorney) the public defender spent a total of 5 minutes reviewing the case and the judges know this. He said, &quot;oh you will probably get probation and a fine&quot; she did 3 months in county with the biggest fine he could throw at her and she served every day of that 3 months. He didn&#039;t allow for good time or work release.<br /><br />dont just pick a lawyer out of the phone book either. Do some research. A good attorney is worth every penny.

				^ Another great tip.&nbsp; However let me throw some information out that some public defenders are one of the hardest workers in the legal industry.&nbsp; SOME of them.&nbsp; Most of them have HUGE caseloads and are paid shitty at best.&nbsp; But there are a handful of some that will diligently defend your case to the death because it will in turn make then look good in the future.&nbsp; <br /><br />When you are in a legal mess and you just got bonded out (awaiting preliminary trial), don&#039;t just go finding a public defender in the main lobby.&nbsp; YOU BETTER BE SUCKING DICK FOR MONEY FOR A BETTER LAWYER.&nbsp; Well don&#039;t really go out degrading yourself but please do make a substantial effort in getting more money, when your future is at stake, how much are you willing to pay?&nbsp; The public defender may or may not go Bruce Lee in the ring, it is a diceroll.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unless you are seriously substantially poor beyond recognition.<br /><br />When finding lawyers, it is a good idea to ask people more than your peers or even google,&nbsp; in order to find my lawyer, I asked a teacher of mine who taught a law class, he referred me to his colleague, not because he knew the guy, but because he knew the guy was definitely one of the higher tiers.&nbsp; (p.s. he hated the guys guts, but he loved me as a student and did not want to see me going away for nonviolent crimes)

				Everyone who is American here (especially young people not really acquainted with our legal system) please watch this video. It could save you jail time.<br /><br />It&#039;s called &quot;Don&#039;t Talk to the Police&quot;. The first half is a great defense attorney telling you why even if you are honest and innocent it can still hurt you. The second half is a successful prosecutor who basically tells you the defense attorney is 100% correct.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc<br />

				No. You just end up losing more time and money. But there is an advantage and some judges enjoy the theater performance.
