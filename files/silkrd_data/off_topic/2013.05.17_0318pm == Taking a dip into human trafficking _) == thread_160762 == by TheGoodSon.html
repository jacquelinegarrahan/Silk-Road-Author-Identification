				Hey everyone,<br /><br />So I&#039;d like to say that aside from my other markets, I think there&#039;s something here that you will all like.<br /><br />THIS IS FOR NON-US RESIDENTS ONLY<br /><br />Let&#039;s get right to it.<br /><br />For sale, thinking $250 total is one &quot;black&quot; family. They currently reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Some call them the Obamas..<br /><br />For your $250 you are purchasing:<br /><br />One Black Male: Named &quot;Barack&quot;, Barack is good at long walks, whining, homosexual endeavors (according to rumor), avoiding accountability, and whining (did I already say that?)<br /><br />Black Female #1: Named &quot;Michelle&quot;, Michelle is not good at anything except trying to assert her ideals on people who do not want them.<br /><br />Two children (FEMALE): The best I can tell, these two take after their mother. They&#039;re oxygen abusers.<br /><br />Alright, I can&#039;t escrow this, but just send me the $250 and go there and pick up your family.<br /><br />$$ Includes one dog for FREE $$<br />$$$ May also include unknown number of private military/secret service at no additional cost$$<br /><br />AGAIN THIS IS FOR NON US PEOPLE ONLY!!!! YOU MUST TAKE THEM WITH YOU WHEN YOU GO!!!!<br /><br />I have no inclination due to moral or ethical constraints of actually selling innocent boys, girls, or other living creatures to fulfill your sexual desires. Please do not contact me with these requests. The above family is being offered for whatever wish you desire from they. They are NOT innocent. They are criminals, they hurt men, women, and children - for those whom they hurt, they feel no compassion. They treat others as a number, a vote, a cause for temporary concern through which they may further their agenda.<br /><br />Again - this is for the OBAMAs only, I do not condone nor do I wish for any innocents to be harmed in your collection.<br /><br />Best of luck! REMEMBER TO SEND ME YOUR $250 first!!!!

Just an idea...<br /><br />* = I sincerely apologise to the entire member base of SilkRoad, apparently I have brought shame upon all of us and my I possess a worrying lack of insight into fantasy films. The use of the term wand is not only insulting, but degrading to the powers of Gandalf who in fact carries a staff and not a wand as I originally suggested. I accept my place in hell for eternity for this grave mistake and profusely thank my peers for correcting this extremely important detail.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />In the words of Judge Judy: &quot;Shut the hell up and sit down. Overruled.&quot; :P<br /><br />I&#039;ll take the Gandalf suggestion into consideration though.. It&#039;d go well with the costume I put on when I suit up for my modding duties. I hope nobody ever sees me though, it&#039;d be very embarrassing.... :-[
