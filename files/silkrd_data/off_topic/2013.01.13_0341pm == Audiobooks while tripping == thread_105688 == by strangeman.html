				I listen to audiobooks a lot, fiction and non-fiction, to pass&nbsp; the time when I&#039;m driving or doing boring shit, and recently I&#039;ve started listening to books when I trip. It all started about six months ago during a solo LSD trip. I had a while list of shit to do if I got bored, but one by one every piece of technology in the house screwed me (Flash crashed my&nbsp; computer, PS3 controller went wonky, winamp wouldn&#039;t run on my laptop) and I was too fucked up to deal with any of it. Finally, I decided to listen to a book for a while, just to let the frustration dissipate until I could think of something to do. I listened to Salman Rushdie&#039;s The Enchantress of Florence and it was incredible. I couldn&#039;t stop listening. The story unfolded in my mind so vividly it was like I was remembering something that really happened to me, rather than just listening to a story.&nbsp; <br /><br />Am I the only person who does this? Anybody got recommendations for books to listen to while tripping?<br /><br />Besides Rushdie I&#039;ve also tried:<br /><br />Kafka on the Shore (Haruki Murakami)<br />The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&nbsp; (Philip K. Dick)<br />I Am Not a Serial Killer (Dan Wells)--This one is probably not a good idea for most people<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend giving this a try at least once if you&#039;re looking for something fun to do on your next trip.

				Not on LSD (I prefer films then but will try this) but I&#039;ve listened to some whilst on Ket or MXE and it was very involving.&nbsp; Life of Pi and some of the Song of Ice and Fire books were good, but just what I happened to be listening to at the time.

				I&#039;ll definitely have to check some of these out.<br /><br />I listened to 2001: A Space odyssey whilst sober and I had to lay down with my eyes closed to take it all in, It was so fascinating.<br />Someone recommended it to me even though I&#039;d already seen the film, they promised me it&#039;s nothing like the book. and starts off in an entirely different place (The point when mankind started to gain self-awareness, develop language and use tools)<br /><br />I keep meaning to listen to it again, because it&#039;s so packed with detail that i&#039;m sure i&#039;ve missed some of it.<br />When I next play it, I&#039;ll be tripping.<br /><br />I recommended this in my thread &quot;Prometheus on LSD?&quot; - I watched the film whilst tripping after people told me its a bit &#039;dark&#039;, but I found the film quite enjoyable and fascinating.<br />There are quite a few good recommendations by me and others of things to do whilst tripping.<br /><br />Next time I&#039;m going to experiment with some mild forms of MDMA (like MDAI, Methylone, etc) combined with LSD, followed by GHB (which is sometimes called &quot;liquid ecstasy&quot; by itself.) on the E comedown.<br /><br />DEFINITELY check out the 2001 book. It&#039;s the original masterpiece and the guy spent ALOT of time researching and speaking to physicists and astronauts, scientists etc before writing it (i think maybe even buzz himself) There&#039;s also a prequel or sequel that I still need to check out.-I&#039;m not sure which.<br /><br />In essence: Cool movie, breathtakingly refreshing audiobook! (get the one thats in many files, read by the man himself (or the co-author, I&#039;m not sure) that includes a prelude/intro from the author.)

				When I bought LSD for the first time from SR (from Tabmonster), I listened to an audiobook (Deathgate Cycle) while I held the blotter on my tongue, waiting for the onset.&nbsp; After a half hour or so, I noticed that the narrative became strangely coincidental, like it was relevant to my thoughts and my personality.&nbsp; This increased until every single phrase had an unexpected, uncanny deeper meaning that described my whole life.&nbsp; I knew what was happening, and that&#039;s when knew I was about to start tripping balls.&nbsp; Another 30 minutes later the walls were melting. :-)&nbsp; Turned out to be great stuff!
