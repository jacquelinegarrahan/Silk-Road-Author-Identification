				Let&#039;s say you spend 3 hours at a bar twice a week trying to pick up women. That&#039;s 6 hours a week, that you could have spent making money. Also don&#039;t forget that you&#039;ll spend an average of a 100 dollars each time at the bar, trying to pick up some bitch. <br /><br />Now, think about this instead. Let&#039;s say you INSTEAD spent those extra 6 hours a week building your own business or making money. You&#039;d save the 200 dollars a week that you&#039;d waste of stupid bitches at a bar, and you&#039;d be earning a lot of extra money from using your free time for business. <br /><br />And with all of that extra and saved money, you can buy a super hot escort once a week. You can fuck a supermodel quality escort once a week for the same amount of effort and money that you&#039;d waste trying to pick up sluts in a bar. <br /><br />What&#039;s the moral of this story? Focus on MONEY FIRST, BITCHES LATER. And if you focus on MONEY FIRST, you&#039;ll be able to fuck a much higher quality woman. <br /><br />When are you men going to wake up and realize that dating, marriage, and relationships are fucking worthless, and the only time you ever spend money on a woman is to buy an escort for sex once or twice a week?<br />

				Who pays for sex? Says a lot about your character in general man and it&#039;s assholes like you that make it hard for guys with good hearts. Once they&#039;ve been with guys like you they become jaded and insecure. Then when a decent guy comes along he has got to work 100 times hard to break that wall she built up to avoid being hurt. All women deserve to be treated with respect and if the only reason you want a woman in your life is to fuck you&#039;d be better off jacking off.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have to spend a dime on women and they still love me. Granted I&#039;m not ugly but I am definitely not rich at the moment. I&#039;ve taken women out in nice cars and really shitty ones. Women really don&#039;t care about that shit unless they are extremely shallow. It&#039;s how you carry yourself and the confidence you exude that can get you any lady you&#039;re interested in.&nbsp; Personally I don&#039;t like high maintenance women because a woman who is independent and intelligent is so much hotter than some stupid blonde who fucks anything and everything.&nbsp; You should try to change your viewpoint or maybe dig a little deeper as to why you refer to them as bitches. Sounds like you&#039;ve either been hurt too much or listen to rap. Likely both.

				I agree with anonypunk. The sad point is that many guys aren&#039;t strong enough to support the woman who&#039;s been badly hurt so it makes it twice as hard for the world. It takes a lot of time to make woman open up for all the aspects of life if she&#039;s been struggling alone in the past. <br />I should say for all of them who are looking only one thing that at least try to understand the woman who&#039;s offering it to you, there are many of them who are confused and really don&#039;t know yet that&#039;s not the thing they actually want and if you find it&#039;s so then you should respect yourself by not following the urges which will definitely exploit you if you can&#039;t control them.

				Sad day for you son, that you hate, revile, and despise the opposite sex. Why aren&#039;t you gay if you hate women so much? Bitterness will get you an ulcer, and all those stress hormones you release will contribute to your continuing middle age spread. <br /><br />Women are not the root of all humanities&#039; ills. It is the hallmark of wisdom, to understand you are the only one who can effect your equilibrium. No one else can &quot;make you angry&quot;, or actually make you do anything at all against your will. <br /><br /><br /><br />(The day you release the long harbored resentment that you can&#039;t bear children, and nurse them at your man boobs, is the day you are free.)

I find that poorer people tend to be more accepting of others, and generally more charitable and nice as well. It is kind of funny how the people with the least to give generally give the most of what they have. I find that in general, the less money a person has the more likely I am to like them. This doesn&#039;t mean I don&#039;t like people with a lot of money, and even a lot of my friends over the years have come from pretty rich families etc. But I tend to feel more comfortable around poorer people, because they are less likely to like the police, less likely to be stuck up assholes, etc. There are plenty of golden rich people, but in general I agree with the statement that the less gold a person has the more likely they are to be a golden person. <br /><br />As far as women go, I find them kind of depressing in general. Many of them are hard wired to find assholes attractive, since being extremely dominant is a sign of strength and women are for evolutionary reasons attracted to that. People dislike the pick up artist culture and think it objectifies women, but my experience indicates that they actually do have a pretty good grasp on female psychology. I suppose men are not any better though, since they are almost exclusively attracted to superficial physical appearance. So in the end men and women are both shallow and primitive animals. I think they are not really compatible with each other for the most part. Their desires are at odds with each other and it becomes gender war. Men want many sexual partners and women want many fewer. It makes sense evolutionarily, as men can impregnate thousands of women in a year but a woman can only become pregnant such that she gives birth once a year. That will lead to women being more picky and hesitant to engage in sex, since they have much more invested into it. Since women are also hard wired to desire their genes to propagate as much as possible, it makes sense they are attracted primarily to dominant men. The more dominant a male is the more likely he can obtain sex, the more likely it is for a male to obtain sex the more likely it is that he will have many offspring, the more likely it is that his off spring will be dominant and obtain sex. Therefore if a female has sex with a dominant male her children will be more likely to be dominant and more likely to obtain sex, and her genes will be more likely to spread. It actually does put men at kind of an advantage, since it is possible to fake a dominant personality but harder for a woman to fake being physically attractive.
