				You&#039;re waiting on one vendor to exchange your USD to BTC so that you can immediately return and spend it all on their page?&nbsp; Makes you really appreciate the extreme cooperative effort that goes into making all of this goodness possible.&nbsp; What are your thoughts on vendors who sell illicit product and cash MP/WU/etc?&nbsp; Is this a risky practice in any way?&nbsp; I feel safer, given the semi-out of escrow nature of BTC trading on here, knowing the vendor has a physical product that is sold primarily based on community reputation.&nbsp; Something more to lose than just $150 BTC vendor account with a few dozen transactions.&nbsp; They also charge more modest rates in my experience, probably because it&#039;s as much like cashing out at the casino as it is providing me with a service.

				<br /><br />And another thing....I hate those auto-run videos you get on some web site. You&#039;ll be happily reading an article when some knob starts talking about minty fresh Colgate breath. Sometimes if you have more than one page tabbed you&#039;ll not be sure where the fucking video is coming from. Grrrrrrrrrr!!!!

Surprisingly those make $xxxxx per day ones, most people do fall for and buy E-books and the like the gullible cunts. The 419 scams are hilarious though I&#039;ve got to give them that, I actually went along with one for ages not giving them real details of course and I was speaking on the phone to the &quot;bank&#039;s representative&quot; who funnily enough was also a senior official of the secret service and a respectable independent businessman, plus a call centre operator. Had a bit of a laugh though, kept them on the phone for 2 hours and they were paying the bill as they called me on an international line :&#039;).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>That&#039;s fucking awesome ;D
