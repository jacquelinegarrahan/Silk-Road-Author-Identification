				Hello to everybody.<br /><br />I&#039;m writing you regarding this topic:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172851.0<br /><br />I&#039;m asking a your opinion about my question, or, if you have time, i&#039;d appreciate if you posted a reply with your thougths in the http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=172851.0 (i know, i shouldn&#039;t be copy-pasting, but hell, i know, i have to improve my english, i just couldn&#039;t find the appropriate word for &quot;not this topic i&#039;m writing in now, but in i was speaking about&quot; :) )<br /><br />I am a fairly new vendor,&nbsp; 10&nbsp; transactions with 100% positive feedback done at the moment (+ a few ones waiting to be finalized) I have in possess a larger quantity of a few products and i think i&#039;m offering at reasonable prices. I offer fast shipping, all the orders made until that point did make it across europe in 2/3 working days. I&#039; ve putten a few listings of free samples, and i got a good feedback. I&#039;ve also set up a small lottery to help me increase my stats (and the buyers to get rid of that $2 dollars worth bitcoin sitting on their account :) ), which i plan to do in a correct and fair manner, once the tickets are sold. I&#039;m not askingody&nbsp; for FE, although i wouldn&#039;t really be happy having to send some product to somebody with horrible stats...<br /><br />So, in simple words:&nbsp; All my samples have been sold in a few hours (without being advertised on the forum). 10 transactions completed + 4 in escrow (hell, i had one buyer with 0/0 stats, i wasn&#039;t 100% sure to send him the product without FE, but i did anyway...) 100% positive feedback and, as u can see in the comments, they all say the order arrived in 2 working days. That&#039;s great is it? :) So, all in all... a good start.<br /><br />All of a sudden comes this member, CannaConnection, (Californian as he states in one of the posts....) and replies to the topic (i use that topic for a small, non aggressive promotion of my products) with only one word: SPAM...<br />Now, i reported this reply to the admins, so they can check (what i can assure), that i can no contact with a user with that name. I tried to respond politely and ask him about his motivations to make that statemement. No reply until now. <br /><br />I take a look at his profile and, if i examine,&nbsp; i can see:<br /><br />-comments like &quot; youngest girl you would fuck? Id say 14. &quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot; is your dick? Mine is 9 and a half!&quot; (in a response to the topic &quot;how big&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot; you been arrested for? I had possession of weed 3 times and domestic battery! &quot; (You guessed right, the Topic name was &quot;What Have&quot;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;We been busy supplying dispensaries. We will open soon!&quot; (that was in a response to: &quot;CannaConnection i seriously doubt you <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will become a vendor, why:&nbsp; because i have not seen one mature post written by yourself. You are like a child on a long journey who<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;consistently asks Are We There yet?&quot; (hail to that post, the author did take some time, to give him a good point to start thinking about...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot; kiss a girl? I was 8! (Topic: first time)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;+YOU&#039;RE GAY, &quot;I have the longest cock here&quot; and similar....<br />Well, another uhmm...let&#039;s call it &quot;anomaly&quot; that i noticed was that his last 23 posts were following the same pattern: &quot;SCAM :(&quot; or &quot;SCAMMER ;(&quot;... al posted in topics like &quot;X Vendor review&quot;, product offers topics and similar....<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, my question (to myself first...) and to you is: WTF? I&#039;m trying to follow all the regular procedures to become a good, honest vendor, which is not so easy, considering some initial expences+bond+time of course.... and then here comes this, i don&#039;t know how to call him &quot;a kid in a need of attention&quot;, &quot;a psycho&quot;, &quot;a-don&#039;t-have-any-friends-so-i-like-to-do-that-when-i-smoke-weed&quot;... trying to troll in my only topic when i discretely try to inform potential buyers of my products and new listings?<br />Fuck, maybe that&#039;s why i didn&#039;t have any order for the first time yesterday? Fuck, i&#039;m only tryong to do fair business, i know i need to be flawless with the whole process in order to keep my customers and acquiring new... So we can all be happy and just....chillout! :)<br /><br />So, in your opinion; is it me that i&#039;m missing something, or i&#039;m just dealing with a weirdo that chose me, to be his next target. <br />If it&#039;s the first one, just tell me so...fuck, i&#039;ll take a holiday break and 40 times the &quot;seller&#039;s guide&quot; again and check the newbie forums over and over.<br />If it&#039;s the second option, please, if you have some spare seconds, do write a short reply, preferably in my &quot;Dr. Chillout fast EU-EU shipping&quot; topic. <br />I&#039;ll much appreciate it.<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Dr. Chillout<br /><br />P.S. i think i found the correct expression that i was looking for at the beginning of this....it was &quot;topic mentioned above&quot; :) )<br /><br />P.P.S. Oh, still offering some extra pills with every order! (ehhmm, sorry the salesman in me just couldn&#039;t be quite for a moment :( )
