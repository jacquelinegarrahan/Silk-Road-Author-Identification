				It was around 530kg they seized. Ozzie media and the Government like to think each kilo of Ice is worth about $850,000....... <br />Buying that quantity directly from China, I doubt they paid more than about $20K per Kilo. But that&#039;s still going to ruin your day and push Ozzie prices even higher - if that&#039;s possible

				&quot;anonymous call&quot; on 500kg of drugs ? either competitor knew somehow and gave them in or they were watched by the police.<br /><br /><br /><br />also any evidence of them destroying that much drugs ?&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe someone would do that they would rather put them into circulation again secretely somehow..

				@SSBD: I think its more due to the drug culture in Australia.&nbsp; Coke in the UK is &#039;almost&#039; socially acceptable.&nbsp; Whereas the closest Aussie equivalent is meth which is still reviled.&nbsp; I think the high price is more to do with the rarity of dealers willing to get it due to limited customerbase.

At that price the sales would never end...ever.<br /><br />Oh yeah, was wrapped to see all the ice seized, thats some nasty shit.
