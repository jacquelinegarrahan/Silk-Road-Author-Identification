				I&#039;m just curious, what drugs have you all done in your lives?&nbsp; Personally, I&#039;ve been getting down for 8 years now and have done a whole bunch of different shit in my life.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here goes in no particular order-<br /><br />-weed<br />-nicotine<br />-alcohol<br />-lsd<br />-mdma<br />-crack<br />-heroin<br />-cocaine<br />-5-MeO-AMT<br />-shrooms<br />-2c-b<br />-2c-i<br />-ketamine<br />-nitrous oxide<br />-DXM<br />-DMT<br />-hash<br />-vicodin<br />-oxy&#039;s<br />-zolpidem<br />-benzos (many types)<br /><br />**This isn&#039;t complete as I know for a fact I&#039;ve been sold shit that was completely different than what I thought it was-I&#039;ve probably been a complete guinea pig for RC&#039;s but have no idea what the fuck they were!**<br /><br />That&#039;s all I can think of, honestly erowid had to help me out with this a little bit...not particularly proud of some of the things I&#039;ve done but life is just a learning journey.<br /><br />To this day, MDMA is still my all time favorite drug and I can get it cheap and pure as FUCK on here, which is amazing :D<br /><br />So what&#039;s your list?&nbsp; What&#039;s your favorite? I&#039;m looking forward to a lively discussion about this!<br /><br />

				-Alcohol (if you consider that a drug)<br />-weed<br />-hash<br />-nicotine<br /><br />and thats it...pretty hard to get any stronger stuff from where I come from (Thank god for SR :) I personally hate nicotine mostly because I cant stand the smell/taste of cigarettes. I usually combine alcohol and weed for a wicked party buzz.<br /><br />I want to try LSD, mushrooms and MDMA. From what I here those give you an epic trip!<br />Can experienced user of the above please tell me what to expect (1st time use) and the best environment to take them? Thnx
