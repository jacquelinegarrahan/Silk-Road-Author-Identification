				For me it&#039;s both, I like visiting the forum sober, but I also like visiting the forum high, being around accepting people and relevant topics, adds to the experience for me personally in a positive way. How about you? :)

				I try to avoid posting whilst high. The times I have done before were embarrassing, I log-on the next day to discover posts that I can&#039;t remember posting and I think &quot;What&#039;s this shit I&#039;ve been writing&quot;.<br />I even thought about having a disclaimer in my sig excusing any crap I&#039;ve written whilst under the influence. But that&#039;s all been done before and I&#039;m only embarrassing myself with my &#039;high posts&#039;, I&#039;m not offensive to anyone, so I don&#039;t feel I&#039;ve anything to apologize for. Also, if I&#039;m on coke I find my brain gets too far ahead of my typing (I&#039;m not the fastest), or if I&#039;m on heroin I just &#039;nod out&#039; on the keyboard and wake up to a whole page of lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllletters across the screennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!&nbsp;

				Excluding weed, because i am always high on weed.<br /><br />I buy things sober and high.. I usually buy big items sober, and toys while i&#039;m high.&nbsp; Right now, I am supercharged from a day&#039;s worth of smoking dmt; i bought the dmt while high on mdma and recently got some shroom extract while high on dmt.&nbsp; &nbsp;dmt is different, at times i&#039;m not sure if outside reality is myself experiencing itself and i am talking and seeing myself in 3rd person, or are we really split reality?<br /><br />why would i create an internet just to send myself substances just to talk about it? hmmm

				I tend to read the forums sober, and post from time to time. <br /><br />I LOVE posting while tripping, in fact I am doing that right now. it&#039;s hard sometimes to proof read before posting to make sure it makes sense, and many times it doesn&#039;t (I sent some PMs the other day while tripping way too hard to have rational discussion, and you were quite right to ignore those messages, sorry)&nbsp; Back to the popint......I don&#039;t remember the original point but I think you have your answer from me now anyway :)
