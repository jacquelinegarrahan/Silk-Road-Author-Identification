				Are there any alternatives to SR? any marketplaces just like this where you can sell your drugs and stuff and buy some also....

				There are but it&#039;s a little bit of a faux pas to ask about SR&#039;s competitors on SR&#039;s own forum. If you search I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find alternatives.

				Places just like SR? Nope. Not in customer base, not in security, not in vendor number, not in longevity.<br /><br />The well known alternatives that pale in comparison and always incites a raised eyebrow from me are Black Market Reloaded (BMR) and more recently Atlantis.<br /><br />There are others I&#039;m sure, but I only travel on the road.

				There are no &quot;marketplaces just like this&quot;. You might wanna look into BlackMarket Reloaded, Atlantis and Sheep. I&#039;m using BlackMarket Reloaded a lot but there&#039;s a lot of scammers there so use your brain when using it. I&#039;ve never used Atlantis and Sheep.

				Searching this forum is a good palce to start. I&#039;ve seen the URL for Atlantis several times on here.<br /><br />But seriously, dude, you&#039;ll be better off if you just cough up the cash and buy a SR vendor account. This place has a much larger customer base than those other markets.

				You get the $500 back after proving you&#039;re solid, so it actually doesn&#039;t cost anything. The $500 is just a bond, not a fee.

				I just placed my first order on Atlantis because for some odd reason LSD is quite a bit cheaper there from UK but everything else is more expensive, often by alot. One small benefit in Atlantis is that you can use LTC and prices are quoted in USD. <br /><br />I don&#039;t see Black Market Reloaded having anything over SR at all.

There&#039;s no reason why someone new shouldn&#039;t go learn the ropes on a smaller site, and then come here once they&#039;ve made enough money &amp; know what online vending involves. Nothing wrong w/ options. Buyers will always favor SR because of the scam protection the high bond offers, and as long as SR has the most buyers it&#039;ll be the place most vendors want to be. <br /><br />But honestly (and I&#039;m not being mean about this - just practical) if you don&#039;t have the $500 for a vendor account you don&#039;t have enough money to vend. Launching on SR (or any online market) is expensive &amp; you&#039;ll need to have enough to cover packaging supplies &amp; shipping (remember that unlike in the real world you don&#039;t get paid immediately &amp; when you do it&#039;s in Bitcoin, which can take time to safely cash out) &amp; the inevitable scamming that happens w/ new vendors. If you can put aside a few grand before you start you&#039;ll be in much better shape. <br /><br />Atlantis has ads up on Youtube w/ their .onion URL. If you just do a clearnet search you&#039;ll find them. Good luck &amp; hopefully it won&#039;t be long before you can put down a vendor bond here. :)<br /><br />

				Sell local. Gotta have tripping friends, or able to at least get the word up. If you can make it on SR selling, get a local fun going first.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t deviate from SR. Seems like the perfect spot for what everyone has to offer. Actually think it&#039;s brilliant.<br /><br />-IW
