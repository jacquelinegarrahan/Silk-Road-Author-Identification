				mt gox still offers dwolla,&nbsp; just change your pass every so often and you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />also do like I did and send dwolla a nasty email asking why you can trust them when they fucked over one of their big accounts.

				you can also get one of those yuba keys now with MT.Gox.. I still waiting on mine, but it seems like a great way to go.. Every time yo insert the USB key, the password changes and you have to have the yuba&nbsp; key to get into the account..

				they (LR) send the pin and account number to your email.&nbsp; without telling you.&nbsp; check your email, it&#039;ll be there.&nbsp; or you can do what I did when I didn&#039;t realize that and just recover both using your email.<br /><br />They don&#039;t tell you very much when you create the account.
