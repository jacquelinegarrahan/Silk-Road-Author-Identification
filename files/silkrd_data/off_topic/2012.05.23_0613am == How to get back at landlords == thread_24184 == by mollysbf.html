				I am not looking to disclose much information other than I am a completely rational person and will never do someone wrong on purpose. Long story short I didn&#039;t get all the verbal agreements from my landlord in writing and now I am out over 1k. This isn&#039;t going to put me on the street or anything but it is still a lot of my money when I went above and beyond to accomidate a small lease violation. After reviewing the lease I am not sure the best thing to do is legal action because of some absurd things I missed in the lease agreement. How can I get them without them knowing it&#039;s me and most importantly not even being a reasonable suspect.

Chuck water in the electrics and make them spend to fix it. Jobs a good&#039;un. :)

				lol i could just tell you didn&#039;t sound like your normal humble self. I feel like that all leads directly to me. I really wish I new they were in the market for something....be it an rv or car or just tools to fix up the house before selling and then I could get them on something. or if they had other rentals I could trash their rental record but they only have this one. Don&#039;t wanna go the legal route because I hate looking over my shoulder more than I already do. Not trying to do the whole smell the place up with a rotten egg or fish thing either. I really would like to find something to not necessarily hurt them financially, that would be awesome though, but rather just overly incoveniance them for a long period of time or something. Like I said I don&#039;t want to get into detail but I really need it to not be tied back to me....I know I could just wait a while but

				You can&#039;t be afraid to get your hands dirty if you are serious about getting them back mate. Remember it&#039;s not what you know, it&#039;s what you can prove. If they wake up in the middle of the night to find their car burned out, who gives a fuck if they suspect you if they can&#039;t prove it? If they come home to find their house on fire, who gives a fuck if they suspect you but can&#039;t prove it?<br /><br />There is no way to get someone back that has done something to you without them suspecting, it&#039;s impossible really. It&#039;s just having the balls to do something and make sure you get away with it. That&#039;s what makes people afraid of you because they lose all power to do anything back because it&#039;s all suspicions and hearsay. When people feel like that you can do anything you want to them and it doesn&#039;t matter because they will be living too much in fear of you to do anything about it. Each new thing that happens and you get away with batters them further and further down and puts them further under the thumb. <br /><br />

				I understand because I have been doing IRL for over 6 years but when it comes to contracts and shit it&#039;s different. Sure they can&#039;t prove it&#039;s me but a cop can still knock on my door and things can get messy from there....I am in no position to go bury my shit somewhere while this alll pans out.

				If you do damage to the rental property (long after you&#039;re moved out obviously) don&#039;t overdo it. I&#039;m assuming this is a residential home, you can somewhat judge what their home owners insurance is by what your security deposit was.<br /><br />You want something that is going to cost him money but not so much that he can actually make money on it by getting a cheap fix and pocketing the rest of the claim, something very common with landlords.<br /><br />Air conditioning unit would be a good place to start, if it&#039;s one that&#039;s mounted on the house, ie not on the house, then you can loosen the bolts connecting it to the braces and let it fall. You could get some tree trimmers with rubber handles, put on some gloves and cut through the conduit, forcing him to buy a completely new unit.<br /><br />You could get a little torch lighter or even a lighter + hairspray, open the phone/cable boxes on the outside and melt as much as possible.

				Well we all think alike because I have thought of many of these ideas. My uncle told me to buy deer piss at walmart and put it in a syringe and plunge it between their window/door and after a few days the smell will NEVER go away and there is nothing to really find since it was a liquid. There really isn&#039;t anything to evil in my book for this situation because they literally robbed me, lied to my face and it was my fault for not getting things in writing. I mean I have dealt IRL for a long time and I have run into people this two faced maybe once in my life. I&quot;ll get them slow and painfully.
