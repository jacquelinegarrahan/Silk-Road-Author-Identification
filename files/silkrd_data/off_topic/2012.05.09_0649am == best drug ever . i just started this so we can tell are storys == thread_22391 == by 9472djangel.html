				Hello every one iv only been around for two months right before Noriega and Tony disappeared im glade i didn&#039;t have any bitcoins&nbsp; during the sale .I have&nbsp; ordered from at least 8 vendors searching for the best and i did like Noriega product but the truth from my experience is most of the cocaine is right above average better than what i can find in the streets right now and that&#039;s why ill pay the higher prices.&nbsp; I would like to ask every one a question and maybe someone can answer. The best coke i ever had was in Jamaica no im not Jamaican i was there on vacation and the coke wasn&#039;t fish scale it wasn&#039;t even white it was off whit tan or yellowish and it was a completely better experience than anything i ever could get at home it was smooth and creamy and made you feel happy and lasted a long time it even felt like a creamy oil when it driped down your throat.&nbsp; Also it wasn&#039;t that expensive.&nbsp; Has any one else ever had coke like that ?&nbsp; Im wondering since there are people on hear from all over the world why no one has mentioned or offered cocaine of this type.&nbsp; And why does every one think fish scale is the best you can get. ,Im looking for that experience again without having to go to Jamaica.

				That wasn&#039;t coke.&nbsp; Higher quality coke won&#039;t produce significantly different effects or last longer.&nbsp; <br /><br />How long did it actually last?&nbsp; Have you researched various other drugs and tried to match it&#039;s affects with one of these?

				Uh...you mean you took a salt and turned it into a freebase?&nbsp; Yea, it isn&#039;t just cocaine that you can do that to...it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s coke.<br /><br />Again, how long did it last?&nbsp; 4 hours?&nbsp; 8 hours?

				I had some of the best coke in my life the other night. It looked so beautiful under the light. Sparkled with goodness. I railed a fat line. I knew i had entered a whole new level. I was on the scarface level of cocaine. I didn&#039;t come down for over a day. It was some really good shit. My dealer hooked me up. He always keeps that fire cocaine. He told me it was so good it deemed the nickname boxxy. <br /><br />

				My friends and I have done the extraction from tea and made 2 oz of 95% before. Pure Bing is clean and focused and doesn&#039;t last a long time, the only reason why Bing lasts is because it&#039;s cut with something and if it lasts forever it&#039;s most often cut with ice. If it felt oily, that ain&#039;t how it should feel. If it&#039;s pure and it hasn&#039;t been overly HCLd it will be tacky.

Drugs don&#039;t work in terms of &quot;What type of xyz is this...*describe effects*&quot;. Pure Bing should only last 45 minutes MAXIMUM and even then the last 10-15 minutes should just be residual effects. You stuff was stomped and most likely with Ice, there are several ways to make it how you said but I won&#039;t go into that here because it might give people ideas. <br /><br />The concept of &quot;What type of Coke is this&quot; just ain&#039;t how chemistry works mate, if something is pure and you know this for certain from analysis tests etc then the only reason why it will differ is because it&#039;s not the same compound and is a derivative having had the structure altered. Either that...or it&#039;s bashed with something else which is just two different drugs and is just pollied effects.
