So suppliers aren&#039;t going to be making as much of the product. So prices go up for people.<br /><br />Also not everyone knows about silkroad

				Also, does anyone know of any RC sites on clearnet that sell to US. I can&#039;t seem to find any and am looking for some 2c-d since I can&#039;t really get it on here. RC&#039;s are getting harder to come by with or without this bill to me but I can see how this law will jack up the prices for these drugs.

				I know right you would think just with any substance you would at least google the high. You don&#039;t just dive into coke from a new source without testing it or finding out if it&#039;s good. I really wanna know how they were able to find a rc website but couldn&#039;t google the dosage <br /><br />Fucking kiddos I swear
