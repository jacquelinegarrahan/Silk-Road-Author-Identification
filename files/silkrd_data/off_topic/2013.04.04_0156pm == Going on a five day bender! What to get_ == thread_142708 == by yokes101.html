				I&#039;m going on a five day mad one. I want to know what you guys would get for five days of clubbing?<br /><br />Got the weed and beers sorted.<br />I&#039;m going to get a gram of MDMA (on that topic who has got the best MD in the UK? I was going to get a gram from the chemical sisters but 25 dollars seems to cheap!)<br /><br />Was thinking about trying out moxy, But just how sexual is that drug?<br /><br />Also if I take some 2CB after some molly will that have any cross tolerance?

				Psychedelics are not really my thing, but from what I have heard the 25i-NBOMe series is great for mild tripping. Are you planning on staying awake the whole time?

				I&#039;d go for MDMA, cocaine, some oxycontins and valiums for end of the nights. Or are you planning on 5 days with no sleep!? I like the sound of the 5 day bender!

				I&#039;d buy some amphetamines and downers too, you can&#039;t take MDMA everyday for 5 days. 2C-B also seems like a good idea. Maybe some ketamine too?
