				Who is going to make it?<br />This movie has the potential to be better than Blow. Hell, the best drug-related movie ever.<br />Maybe there is come privacy right issues and we have to wait for Pickard to die or to consent to his name and image being used.<br />Regardless, a bio-flick needs to be produced asap.<br /><br />His story is mindblowing. Getting caught up with that fucking eccentric marijuana smuggling snitch Gordon Todd Skinner.<br />Even his early life is interesting. Coming from a rich family in Georgia, getting accepted to all these exceptional colleges including Princeton, enrolling in San Franscico State and taking a class taught by Alexander Shulgin who taught him how to make MDMA. <br />Meeting Tim Scully (the man who produced Orange Sunshine) and the rest of the Brotherhood of Eternal Love and adopts their approach to distributing Lucy.<br />Then he began producing MDMA and LSD, getting busted in the late &#039;70s. Served a short prison term and got out and focused strictly on acid.<br />Setting up a movable lab in a trailer. Going to NorCal to Denver to Oregon to New Mexico.<br /><br />Meeting back up with Scully to compare manufacturing methods.<br /><br />Getting busted again in California in 88 and one of the narcs gets accidentally dosed dissembling the lab, ends up having a bad trip for 48 hours. <br />Sentenced to 5 years, becoming a Buddhist while incarcerated and comes out and gets right back to manufacturing.<br /><br />People in his inner-circle telling him to raise the prices to increase profits.<br />Pickard&#039;s response...produce more than ever so the price drops.<br /><br />Meets that creepy fuck Gordon Skinner and hangs out in the infamous Atlas-E Missle Silo with it million dollar stereo and elaborate decor.<br />When he does get pinched because of Skinner tipping off the Feds he runs into a snowy field and being a marathon runner, eludes the police for 48 hours. <br />Even evades infra-red cameras as he hid under cold leaves in a man&#039;s barn.<br /><br />I mean this story writes itself.<br />I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Mr. Pickard himself is writing it right now as he sits in the Federal Penitentiary with his LIFE SENTENCE.

				Oh, man, you had me excited. When I clicked on it, I thought you were going to say it was in the process of being produced. Oh, well, I think it&#039;s a great idea nevertheless. <br /><br />Semi-unrelated to your topic:<br />So..I&#039;m guessing you are not a fan of Krystle Cole?
