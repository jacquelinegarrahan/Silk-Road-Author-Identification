				I&#039;m not surprised that its so expensive, but I was surprised that in spite of the vast diversity of weed vendors it seems to all be consistently way too expensive for me to even consider ordering rather than buying local. I&#039;m not aware of a single weed vendor here who can compete with the most expensive pot dealer I&#039;ve encountered in my life. Most people seem to be selling a gram for 20 to 50 dollars. I&#039;m Canadian so shit might be different here than in other places, but as I see it I&#039;m in one of the worse provinces for weed and still it doesn&#039;t make sense to order. Another thing that bothers me is that none of the canadian weed vendors seem to sell pressed hash in small quantities, as it is something which I cant get locally right now and I&#039;d rather not order weed products internationally. I think for canadians budmail is a much better bet than silk road in terms of weed, and its really annoying to use budmail. <br /><br />But then again I hardly ever smoke weed anymore. I did every day for years but now I don&#039;t really care.

				I look around so it&#039;s as close to what I can get locally price wise. A majority of the time, I get it even cheaper. I can get high quality organics locally and on SR, but getting it on SR circumvents the drive and the hassles of unreliability and inconsistencies with dealers. I&#039;d rather have a bit of patience and get my package delivered to my door than drive and not really knowing what I&#039;m going to get.

I can buy weed on SR for so much cheaper than I can locally that if I needed the money, I could make thousands of dollars a month just flipping weed, even if I had to pay the ounce price being asked (around $300 per is pretty standard on the site, would sell for $400 an ounce or even $480 an ounce if sold in quarters).

What did surprise me I guess is the discrepancy in my experience with weed in the world and the indication silk road prices give me about other parts of the world. Relative to myself and to the OP the weed seems &quot;overpriced&quot; but you&#039;re right that objectively there is no reason to judge the prices against some standard other than those determined naturally through supply and demand. <br /><br />To me ten dollars a gram is like buying candy at the gas station. You know you can get more way cheaper at the grocery store but you don&#039;t care because its convenient.

				The other day, I paid $50 for an eighth of weed from my local dealer. I mean it was decent weed, but definitely not good enough for that price. The point is that weed is very expensive in a lot of areas. After that purchase, I decided it was the last straw. From now on, I will be buying medicinal marijuana from someone on the SR. It&#039;s better quality and cheaper. I&#039;ve been a fool to wait this long.

				Everybody thinks Brazil is the land of weed, but like I explained in another thread, just brick weed.

You will never find a super lemon haze at favela. You will find with a good lookin white guy wearing Gucci. Drug dealers don&#039;t know there is weed much more stronger and much more tasty than the one they sell. They do not believe when I tell them they can grow weed indoor using HPS lights and they thinking I&#039;m kidding when I say they can get much more money, moving much less weed volume, taking much less risk, without buying anything. If I say some people pay easily 20dolars a gram for this kind of weed, they laugh at my face.

				If the gov their makes you take a piss test and you fail you get this hard core rehab for like 6 months. If your not from the country they will kick you out and fine you for failing a piss test. If you get caught with a small amount for locals its usually less than a year and rehab for a first offense and for people that are not from Singapore you get kicked out + a large fine. <br /><br />I think the death penalty if for like 500+ grams of weed or 30+ grams of hash. They never execute people unless they are from outside of the country though usually. Starts to much conflict with other places.

Usually, we send stuffs to there. I could be terrible wrong anyway...<br /><br />But the Lion is the only public service that works in Brazil, and unfortunately, works a lot. Every medium size package they will open looking for contraband. With legal items, they tax you so high that sometimes it&#039;s not a good business pay it, and then, they auction the stuffs.

				I love buying weed on SR for the variety of different strains, I&#039;m not in a &#039;weed friendly state&#039;, so I don&#039;t mind paying a little more for quality.

				fuck no, you&#039;re not the only one that finds weed here is way overpriced.&nbsp; however, I can&#039;t grow pot, I don&#039;t live in california, and I&#039;m an adult...so would I rather go visit the socially dysfunctional scrubby kid I know who lives 3 towns over and buy whatever he has, or do I want to rent a po box and buy expensive but amazing weed on the internet while I should be working?&nbsp; clearly, i&#039;ve chosen the latter.<br /><br />plus, if you&#039;re a tightwad light me, you&#039;ll spend a week or so sizing up all the vendors and finding the most amount of weed for the least amount of money, which usually is equivalent to a straight deal in the real world.&nbsp; <br /><br />200 for a Z is pretty good though.&nbsp; 120 for a half of good indoor is also a pretty good price around here.&nbsp; you should expand your grow-op a little and deal on SR.

				Nearly all drugs are expensive here if you consider that most sellers are buying wholesale and selling at a consumer level, cutting out a lot of middlemen. Well they aren&#039;t necessarily expensive, but vendors profit margins are definitely very high and I&#039;m sure most can still make a healthy profit at much lower prices, it&#039;s just a case of waiting for more and more wholesale vendors to enter the market. Once vendors can only profit off the inherent profitability of this business model, and not both that and surplus demand, Silk Road will really start to flourish. <br /><br />The costs of refunds/resends, reverse scammers, laundering costs etc etc pale in significance to the great profits offered by, for example, selling a kilo of Cocaine in 1-5g increments and therefore fail to justify high prices (not that they need to be justified, they simply are what they are).

				i think it is a little expensive which is prolly why i havent bought it yet. i can get eigths for 50 of pretty good weed, id rather spend my bitcoins on other things but not to say i wont try it one day maybe. but ounces i refuse to pay more than 275 for dank weed. 300+ just too much for me these days. i used to pick up at 175 at the store so i got spoiled.

				When I first encountered this site, I did think the weed was pretty expensive. However, since considering becoming a vendor on here myself, and running through the figures, I realize that there is a big difference in the prices you see as a buyer, and the amount of cash that ends up in the vendor&#039;s pocket.<br /><br />First, there are the site fees.&nbsp; For small orders, you are looking at around 14% loss before your bitcoins can even leave the site.&nbsp; At this point, you could theoretically just dump them onto an exchange and cash out straight to your bank account, but most prefer to cover their tracks by laundering their coins, then cashing out via more anonymous methods, which can be expensive, and somewhat unreliable.<br /><br />Then you have all the expenses associated with packaging and shipping, and the other expenses associated with this method (occasional fraud, funds tied up in escrow etc).

				Great answers and perspectives.<br /><br />Depending on geographical location and who you know, it is either overpriced or a value.<br /><br />Now the difference is the customer. I have never even really thought about smoking weed on the SR level. However, the fact that weed is offered here while I am looking for other things piques my interest. All these strains, unless you live on the West Coast can&#039;t be found locally and/or it is not worth the risk to look for it locally.<br /><br />Now, I was in one game IRL and many of my customers were in the weed game, so I got extremely lucky in that I have 3 maybe 4 premium quality weed guys that pick up on first ring if I ever need any. Just depends on your situation.

				I was selling quarters on here for under $100, but troll buyers have wrecked my feedback. Meanwhile, those same trolls seem to leave other vendors (the ones that charge a lot) alone - go figure.

				An 1/8 around here is 50-60 bucks for good chronic and its still not the quality that SR provides. I buy in bulk and that drops the price. I&#039;m also not dealing with the people selling at 300oz. I can turn a nice profit selling at below market value here and still smoke for free.

				the only people that should be bitching about pricing are the ones who dont live in a medical state and cant get dank as easy i can get medical grade just as good 10min away for a little more money but the variety and simplicity on s.r is the best thing and to be honest a qp of medical grade weed for close to 1000 aint bad at all just buy in bulk. and if u dont like pricing then y dont u find a weed dealer and beat everyone out on there pricing.

				I dont live in a MJ friendly state, so there isnt driving anywhere legally to get it for me, hence my interest in SR. Prices in my area are comparable to SR, however if I drive an hour away, my prices are cut in half, although its usually just brick quality. I find that most vendors on SR sell in quality not so much quantity, but if you&#039;re like me and some an ounce a week, quantity matters sometimes.

				Look, honestly it all depends on what area you are in. Certain drugs show trends in different areas.<br />I could walk outside right now and go up to a random person, ask if they have weed/can get some: I assure you they could.<br /><br />It may be quality or not, but it is accessible in my area. Being that availability is high here, the price therefore is low. It&#039;s supply and demand, basic drug-enomics.<br /><br />Now, if I did the same thing and asked for LSD or MDMA, they would look at me like I was spitting random letters at them and have no idea what I&#039;m talking about.<br /><br />Weed is the only thing highly available around my area/state. Therefore it&#039;s low, much lower than the prices on SR. Yet, if I wanted to find other things, it just isn&#039;t here. If I were to talk to dealers that can actually import MDMA from another city (which honestly would probably be cut), I&#039;ve been told prices as high as $100-120 a gram. Marginally, that&#039;s much higher than what you talk about what weed. The same applies for LSD and many other drugs.<br /><br />I think most vendors pick somewhat of a higher premium for themselves and sell at that price. With products such as LSD that they can monopolize, they do. <br />:)

				the SR market speaks for itself. I imagine if this site keeps growing undisturbed the price of everything will go down. But as others have said, price evaluation depends on your geographic location. In the U.S., in a weed friendly state, everyone and their mother has herb to smoke.
