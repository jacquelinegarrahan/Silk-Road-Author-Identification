				its stupid to think that holland is the Go-to place for anyone into drugs and crime. 70s&#039;90s yeah but the government has gone a helluva lot more right wing in the past decade, yeah sure you can grow your own weed, test your drugs and live your own life not on 24 hour cctv but its not the place it used to be.

				I don&#039;t see the problem. When we talk about the legalization of drugs this is what it means - tax &amp; regulation and a good product. You are still free to buy nicotine, and that&#039;s a good thing for people who want to smoke. <br /><br />You all buy your illegal drugs in plain packaging. ;)

				When Las Senioras y Seniores de las Bilderbergers have fucked up the nothern western hemisphere even more, lets say in about 10 - 15 years, I was thinking about moving shit out to AU/NZ. A friend from Melbourne popped by during the past couple of months and actually told me about things down there. If anything, they are becoming America more and more. I was told even though no one gives a damn about them in world trade and economics, politics, it&#039;s the usual game: everyone still thinks america is nr 1 and they need to follow into their footsteps, not realizing american officials are the biggest dumbfucks in the known world, or, put differently, the most ruthless bastards. lol .. btw, the same is true for european leaders, and yea, russian and the rest of the world. <br />anyhow, not trying to offend anyone, just wanted to say the world is fucked no matter in which part. the only place is a place in the forest in some community camp in the middle of peru :P but damn no SR down there...

				Any smokers actually think this will make a difference to their habbits? I don&#039;t smoke (tobacco) anymore, but if I did this wouldn&#039;t do shit either way.<br /><br />And that&#039;s what&#039;s most frustrating, having a government not only being so ridiculously controlling of apparently legal activities, but doing it in such a pointless way. And taxpayers pay these people&#039;s wages... FFS.
