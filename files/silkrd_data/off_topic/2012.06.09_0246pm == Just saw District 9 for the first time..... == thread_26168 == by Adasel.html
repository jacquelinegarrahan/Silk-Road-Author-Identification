				Yeah good movie. The best bit is when they&#039;re killing the infants with the flame thrower, something about it just seems like great commentary to me. Showing how atrocities can be committed against a species simply because they&#039;re considered sub-human

				There has always been hopes and rumors about a D10 movie, but i dont think it will happen.<br />I mean apart from needing an hour to tie up loose ends, what would the movie be about??<br />Yeah fucking prawns lol<br />After watching the hero go through all the horror of being experimented on like a lab rab, and having that angry goon chase him through the whole movie, does it seem wrong, or was i right in enjoying watching humans explode like they just got put in the microwave???<br />The best tech in the movie by far was the scene where the robot suit comes to life and takes out the drug lords about to cut his arm off.&nbsp; Then when he takes control of it i was just like OMG, how much better can this movie get?<br />Any suggestions about a plot for a second movie??<br />Be nice to see the prawns come back and declare war on us!!!&nbsp; How fucked would we be?!!

				The craft of the film was beautiful - cinematography, animation of the aliens, etc.&nbsp; The action was superbly shot.&nbsp; Honestly, one of the most visually interesting movies of the decade.<br /><br />However, the story was comically cliche and everything was else was plain dumb.&nbsp; There was literally no substance or subtlety to any of it.&nbsp; Ugh.

				genghar, id have to disagree.<br />If you see by previous posts this movie touched a lot of people in a lot of ways.<br />The story line was superb.&nbsp; Think about it.&nbsp; Of all the cities in the world the aliens come to Johannesburg, not new york or washington as perceived in Independence Day. <br />The CGI gave a lot of character to the aliens too.&nbsp; Personally i thought it was like watching something real, as it was happening, as the cinematography was intended.<br />You didnt feel any empathy for the hero of the movie when he was going through all that torturous experimentation.<br />Personally towards the end when he was all suited up protecting his alien friend, I was just hoping they both got through it all.<br />To say everything else in this movie was just UGH, comes from the mind of a man who watches film just for the action.<br />This one had everything.<br />But, of course, that is just MY point of view.

				Great movie. Watched it (for the second time) on LSD with some nice tunes instead of audio. Had me crying tears of life by the end of the movie. <br /><br />That robot coming to life really was a great scene.

				Awesome movie, I remember when it just came out and people were raving about it, but I waited to watch it cause I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d like it that much.<br />But damn was I wrong, a lot of real shit was in that movie.

				Yeah the setting in South Africa was pure original.&nbsp; A sci-fi movie made by south african people.<br />This is probably why it didnt make it in the box office, a lot of yanks might not understand what is being said etc, no offense intended of course.&nbsp; I am of the understanding that Americans had to have The Full Monty in subtitles because of the northern accents.&nbsp; Which is totally understandable of course.<br />Any more news of a sequel?

				I somehow feel this wont be made into a sequel, or a franchise.&nbsp; The guy who directed it was clearly stating a message about the partied that occurred in South Africa all those years ago.&nbsp; Someone said before that just because a movie is left open, it doesn&#039;t mean it needs a sequel.
