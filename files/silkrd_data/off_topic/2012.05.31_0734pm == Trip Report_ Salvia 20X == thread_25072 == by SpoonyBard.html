Yeah.<br /><br />Her: huh<br /><br />Me: Still a little dizzy, but the forgetting who I am and where I was part was really pretty brief.<br /><br />Her: sounds interesting certainly<br /><br />Me: Yeah. I could tell yo about it if you want to call or go voice.<br />Me: But I think if I type I&#039;ll just get scattered and it&#039;ll be too slow.<br /><br />Her: not right now, I think<br />Her: glad you had a good time though<br /><br />Me: Fair enough. Yeah, it was pretty odd.<br />Me: I was thinking it didn&#039;t work and I was just dizzy,<br />Me: Only the blood in my ears kept sounding like it was pulsing louder in time with the flickering candle,<br />Me: And the people made of the light and shadow started sounding like that too, and I had to tell them &quot;Shut up! It didn&#039;t work, I need to put this pipe down.&quot;<br />Me: And then I realized there was no one else here, but the negative space around the two doors in my bedroom was looking more and more like a boy and a girl.<br />Me: And I realized the people I was talking to weren&#039;t there, they were just made of geometry.<br />Me: And I was supposed to be too, and they were getting impatient waiting for me, so I just settled back into my place on this rotating mosaic of plastic lines.<br />Me: By this point I knew damn well I was hallucinating, but it was cool.<br /><br />Her: man<br />Her: yeah<br /><br />Me: So I just laid back on my bed, and the hexagon grid of brightly colored plastic around me scaled back with me a part of it,<br />Me: and it just kept zooming out and out until I saw the cube that it was a part of, and the stairs THAT was a part of.<br /><br />Her: wow<br /><br />Me: And the white duck head and yellow bill were just coming into focus, and I was getting dizzy because the whole thing was rotating as it zoomed out,<br />Me: And then I thought &quot;Great hallucination! Wait, I knew that part, but where am I ACTUALLY? And who am I if the rest of this isn&#039;t there?&quot;<br />Me: And that made me think of my bedroom again, and I opened my eyes to make sure it was there, and then I wanted to get back to Donald Duckn and the grid people, but it was fading rapidly.<br />Me: And them I debated whether to let it stay in my head or see if you were still on Skype. &gt;8-&gt;<br /><br />Her: hehe<br /><br />Me: Total elapsed time was maybe 6 or 7 minutes.<br />Me: Wanna know the good part?<br /><br />Her: yep<br /><br />Me: This was the 20X extract. About 40 mg.<br />Me: The cheap party pack I bought has a gram each of 20X, 40X and 60X.. &gt;8-&gt;<br /><br />Her: so, neat<br />Her: this was just a little taste<br /><br />Me: (Oh, and I spilled a bunch of it between hits trying to tamp it out with my lighter. I managed to get a little more somehow while I was starting to get dizzy.)<br />Me: Yeah.<br />Me: And this stuff&#039;s LEGAL!<br />Me: Relatively.<br />Me: Fun, huh?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Is doing drugs and sitting in front of a computer like a new generation fad or something?

				I once had two grams of 10x extract on a school trip in Italy. I hid the baggy deep within the guts of my laptop so it wouldn&#039;t be found by customs because we had to leave the EU (Germany -&gt; Switzerland) and re-enter it (Switzerland-&gt;Italy).<br />Well yeah, we (me plus seven buddies) smoked all of it in our hotel rooms in the evenings and we were tripping balls and laughing our asses off. Salvia is insanely visual and unlike anything I have ever experienced.

Me and my buddy decided to watch a video simulation of a blackhole on youtube, and it was incredible because it felt like I was swirling into the infinite with my body still in tact. Even though I was sitting properly and not moving at all, it felt like my entire body was being swung around like it was a piece of paper with intense OEV&#039;s of every movement I made was a lapse in the multiverse, everything around me was a doorway into another reality. So I can&#039;t say it was a waste of drugs.

				Salvia frightens me more than DMT to be honest. It&#039;s like spice compared to marijuana in my eyes. I&#039;m pretty sure an average person would have become schizophrenic visiting the places I have on Salvia. It feels like I&#039;ve been gone centuries at a time on Salvia trips, it&#039;s always hard to find myself again. :( Obviously they&#039;re completely different substances, but I feel like Salvia has the ability to take away while DMT&#039;s power is to restore. Salvia&#039;s forcefully made me give up smoking cigarettes and amphetamines, literally it completely burnt away the urges I had for them. Suffice to say it&#039;s changed me psychologically, it&#039;s scary. My memory always become cloudy, almost like amnesia, for a good time after smoking Salvia. However smoking DMT always floods my brain with memories that I&#039;ve completely forgotten, almost like a slideshow. Despite this I still enjoy having a go at it every now and then, Salvia can be rewarding if respected. ;)

After a salvia trip you have that stale, empty &quot;what the fuck just happened&quot; feeling, not knowing how to integrate the experience. It&#039;s not as bad as my description makes it sound though.<br />Shrooms feel very &quot;organic&quot; while salvia feels &quot;mechanic&quot; in a very, very metaphoric, differentiated, figurative sense. Maybe you know what I&#039;m talking about, Gary :D

I am not &#039;new generation.&#039; I&#039;m 38, and wager I was surfing for porn on my Sinclair ZX80 before you were born.*<br /><br />2.) I was not tripping salvia at my computer. I was tripping salvia on my bed. When I came out of it and remembered who I was, I reached for my iPad and looked for someone to describe the trip to before I forgot it all. <br /><br />3.) I&#039;m good friends with my girlfriend&#039;s other boyfriend, and I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m the more interesting one.
