				Last time I tripped on DXM I came to believe I was a Robot and woke up the next morning and had apparently scrawled &quot;I am not me&quot; on my wall. On the other hand, I had an epiphany that I needed to start doing better in school and motivate myself by thinking about how miserable I was with my current position in life, which lasted about two years before I had to rely on SSRIs to do well in school.

				Almost every time I&#039;ve taken DXM I&#039;ve felt as though I had become a robot. The experience very much so deserves the name &quot;robotripping&quot;

				It&#039;s one of those weird drugs for me where low doses (&lt; 250mg) I feel like shit and wish I hadn&#039;t taken it. Over 400mg and I&#039;m good but I&#039;m also likely to puke because I have a weak stomach.

				The roboitch got so bad last night that I couldn&#039;t enjoy my trip at all. I was just SO FUCKING ITCHY. Definitely won&#039;t go with those liquid gels again. Never experienced that sort of itching on syrup.<br /><br />I&#039;d definitely like to get some funds together and purchase some pure Dextromethorphan Hcl some day. Or just extract some of my own.

				I&#039;ve had some beautiful experiences on dxm. I have also had more intense experiences than eating acid. (Not good experience.) Which led me to doing something really stupid. It&#039;s a tricky little drug. Sometimes it is really loving and shows you a lot. Other times i feel like i&#039;m in a battle with it. It seems like it&#039;s purpose is to destroy my ego. I would advise caution with this little substance. Don&#039;t get me wrong. Dxm will always have a special place in my heart. I just have to use it with caution. Also Moniker has wonderful prices on dxm.
