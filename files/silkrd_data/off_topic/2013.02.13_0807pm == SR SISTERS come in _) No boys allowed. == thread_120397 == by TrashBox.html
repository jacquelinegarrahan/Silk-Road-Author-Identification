				Hahaha I&#039;ve never really thought about DPR like that.. I more picture him the sweet little IT guy in the office building that is never seen or heard, but makes everything happen. Probably with those big cute hipster glasses :P<br /><br />I have a lot more respect than lust for the guy, if anything I&#039;d just want to shake his hand &lt;3

I think Batman is kind of a pussy. Like seriously. If I had an insurmountable fortune I could pay a bunch of people to make me a bad ass armored suit and all sorts of crazy weapons to use too, he&#039;s not very super, just rich. You could argue that with Ironman too I guess, but not really. Tony Stark is a genius that created everything himself, nothing was really given to him besides the resources to make his brilliant inventions. Literally everything batman has/learned came from someone else. Plus I like me some gymnast action, get spiderman over for a crazy fuck. Or get rough with wolverine :P&nbsp; Can you tell I&#039;m not a fan of DC? :P Okay nerd rant concluded.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120397.msg821672#msg821672">Quote from: TrashBox on February 13, 2013, 09:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">BULLSHIT TK!!!<br /><br />You&#039;re telling me that if you were somehow lucky enough to end up locked in a room together with the biggest drug dealer IN THE WORLD that you would just shake his hand.

I bet he really isn&#039;t that into them (although I bet he likes he&#039;s amphetamines for.. er... productivity :P ) because of his personal security and all that. But given that circumstance, and the fact that I would be the only person in the world that knew his true identity, I could guarantee I&#039;d shake a lot more than his hand.... Now that you mention it. It is kind of like fucking a super hero&nbsp; ;D

				i echo your booooooooo i&#039;ve only heard a few excerpts being read but it was very poorly written drivel. bored sheltered simpletons were the main target demographic. like the daily mail. or fox news maybe. shit i used to watch that stoned WE CAN&#039;T HAVE A MUSLIM RUNNING FOR OFFICE THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. i love their reporters, they&#039;re hilarious with their misplaced outrage. is it still as good these days does anyone know? nollywood movies have taken its place in my heart. what&#039;s this thread about?

				hi lovely ladies in here :) this does seem like a nice little spot. (or not so nice maybe...)<br /><br />I agree ron that was a painful thread... i tried to avoid it as the whole &#039;what is rape&#039; discussion happens every day on every forum, and the guy seemed like a troll. Although i guess i didnt do much discussing and more yelling :/&nbsp; but seriously any time a male is like &#039;maybe she liked it tho&#039; i want to slap someone.<br /><br />I think it would be amazing if DPR was a woman. The whole mystery of it is hot enough as it is, but add that twist and it would be perfect.&nbsp;

Especially being the literary snob I am... note that in the quote above, I mention that I STOLE the book from the bookstore. That book isn&#039;t worth its weight in highway dust.<br /><br />The only good thing that came from that book is an encounter I had with an older woman... she was reading the book at the time and somehow it kept making her think dirty thoughts about me. So maybe this book is relighting some sexual fires for some people. Or maybe it&#039;s just telling people how to write erotically. I&#039;d rate it a 2/10 on the literature scale, a 5/10 on the spice-up-bedroom-fantasies scale, and a 10/10 on the kindling scale. It burns really well and provides adequate combustion for the fireplace at home. <br /><br />And I can definitely give you some sexy female-DPR scenarios if you like. :)

Took my younger sister to the concert for her 20th bday :)<br /><br />I could go on for about ten double-spaced, Times New Roman 12 pt font pages about how much 50 Shades of Gray sucks a donkey penis in comparison to the MAJORITY of other things published out there. Just goes to show how shitty our popular culture is these days. Like Ms. Swanson over here, I was barely able to read more than a couple of pages before I burned that POS book I stole like the kindling it was meant to be. <br /><br />As for DPR being female... interesting. Very interesting, indeed. I think it&#039;s totally possible and just added a whole new level to the DPR sexiness discussion. <br /><br />*runs off back to the boy&#039;s side of the forums*<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />AHHHHHH invite me next time!!!!!&nbsp; Lucky zip&#039;s little sis.<br /><br />And shame on you for buying that book hahaha.&nbsp; But glad you burned it.&nbsp; I think the same people who enjoyed the sparkly vampire crap were having whoregasms over that nonsense.&nbsp; <br /><br />And HOLDUP....<br /><br />we need more hot DPR sex scenarios please....my dirty mind can only provide so many ideas for you guys...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I apologize for the diction and syntax of my previous post, it was a bit confusing, I will admit. &quot;Like Ms. Swanson over here, I was barely able to read more than a couple of pages before I burned that POS book I stole like the kindling it was meant to be.&quot;<br /><br />I would never, EVER pay for a book like that. Especially being the literary snob I am... note that in the quote above, I mention that I STOLE the book from the bookstore. That book isn&#039;t worth its weight in highway dust.<br /><br />The only good thing that came from that book is an encounter I had with an older woman... she was reading the book at the time and somehow it kept making her think dirty thoughts about me. So maybe this book is relighting some sexual fires for some people. Or maybe it&#039;s just telling people how to write erotically. I&#039;d rate it a 2/10 on the literature scale, a 5/10 on the spice-up-bedroom-fantasies scale, and a 10/10 on the kindling scale. It burns really well and provides adequate combustion for the fireplace at home. <br /><br />And I can definitely give you some sexy female-DPR scenarios if you like. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />HAHAHAHAHA +1&nbsp; that whole post was full of awesome.&nbsp; I love the rating scale.

				This is a huge problem, people need to realize that if you post something that you have posted on the clearnet YOU WILL BE LINKED AND SCREWED. ALSO YOUR SR USERNAME MUST HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR REAL NAME OR USERNAME ON ANY CLEARNET SITE.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />As a side note if DPR is a man, which I am almost positive he is not, it would go like this. 20 of DPR&#039;s closest girls doing all sorts of naughty things to him and each other, while DPR is distant reading a book on philosophy, or libertarianism, not even paying any attention to the girls all playing with his dick.<br /><br />This is the way it would go because DPR always seems distant to his beloved community. We know he loves us even though he doesn&#039;t say it.<br /><br />Chaos

				So hey, Sisters of SR, I&#039;ve got a question for y&#039;all. And plz, don&#039;t take this in the wrong way, mmmkay? <br /><br />This is just one of Zip&#039;s questions about WHY the ladyfolk do some of the things they do, yanno?<br />So...why is it that women have to ask men to cum during sex?<br />Sorry if this is like, your trademark move, but why?? It&#039;s a sure way of delaying my orgasm, no doubt.<br />I&#039;d love to be educated, and if not, then maybe my opinion will be enlightening to someone? <br /><br />Okay. Just posting this cuz i can&#039;t sleep cuz I&#039;m sleeping on the floor and I have allergies to dust and the dust is making me sneeze like every 10 minutes. Scratch that, every 5 minutes. Dammit, just sneezed again.<br /><br />&lt;3333<br /><br />P.S. Hooray for my 600th post!

				LOL i&#039;d guess it&#039;s pretty much the same reason as why guys always ask if you&#039;ve cum yet.. either they genuinely can&#039;t tell, don&#039;t realise asking makes them look thick as shit and is a massive mood killer or it&#039;s a not so subtle way of saying hurry the fuck up i&#039;m getting pretty bored and i&#039;m out of moves, if you take much longer i&#039;m going to collapse from exhaustion and I WANNA GET MINE DAMNIT. most guys are out after jizzspunk numero uno at least for a break so shouldn&#039;t really have to ask.. inexperience? but wtf girl can&#039;t identify a male orgasm though... refer them to a course, some reading/viewing material or the nearest exit haha<br />now gtfo that post was in no way related to the spice girls. at least drop a cheeky spice up your life in there or something. rude.

				if a girl says something and you want to know why she said it then ask her, not just any female existing in the world because we may all have vaginas and whatnot but surprisingly enough we are individuals and we don&#039;t have identical personalities/thought processes. just make a point to say beforehand and boom sorted. it&#039;s not rocket science. why the fuck don&#039;t people just talk to each other about their personal issues... straight people are so weird. <br />ohh ladylim did you do a tom gabel?!
