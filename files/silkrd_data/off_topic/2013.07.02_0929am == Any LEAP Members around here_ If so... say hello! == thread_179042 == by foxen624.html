				Most of my life, I didn&#039;t think that ANY branch of or associated with LE could be anything but trouble.&nbsp; But this particular group - in case anyone hasn&#039;t heard of them..&nbsp; &quot;Law Enforcement Against Prohibition&quot;.&nbsp; I heard of them a while back, did some research on them and their organization and as far fetched as it may seem, these guys are actually on our side.&nbsp; Granted, most of them are retired as far as I could tell, but they are a global group of ex cops, judges, etc...&nbsp; who know how harmful is the WOD and are fighting hard to end it and want to legalize (not just decriminalize) all drugs.&nbsp; I bet many would welcome the wealth of info and advice they probably have to offer.... or not.&nbsp; But either way, if they are here along with their not so like-minded counter parts, they can see this post as well as all the other posts on this forum, and if they&#039;re not, they can&#039;t.. so, no harm done then by making this post...<br />&nbsp; They&#039;ve got a website on the *clearnet*&nbsp; http://www.leap.cc/<br /><br />Just something I remembered what with all the threads on here about infestations of LE....

				you know I&#039;ve wondered how many cops come here as &quot;real customers&quot; and considered asking in the forums but I figured it would turn into a shit show of epic proportions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Plus why buy here when you can just rob anyone you want and then tell them you&#039;re doing them a favor by not arresting them... lol&nbsp; and there is always the evidence room.<br /><br />LEAP is a good thing. Of course they won&#039;t be taken serious.&nbsp; Prisons are private business whose only goal is to put as many inmates as possible into the smallest possible space so no moral, logical, or health based arguments will ever work.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But i don&#039;t trust any cops and wouldn&#039;t be asking them to come say hi.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>&nbsp; me neither!!&nbsp; Well I trust them to be ignorant small minded thugs who break more laws than the majority of us.&nbsp; Anyone know if the often repeated statement that LEO&#039;s have the highest rate of Domestic abuse of any occupation?&nbsp; It would not surprise me at all as the job attracts the worst element of humanity, well other than CO&#039;s<br />

I don&#039;t see why they would not want to offer what advice and knowledge they have to help us stay safer in the meantime.&nbsp; And like I mentioned in the OP, I didn&#039;t send an invite from clearnet or anything ridiculous like that..&nbsp; &nbsp;just mentioned something to the effect that they wouldn&#039;t see the post if they weren&#039;t here already anyway...&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, I realize I&#039;m not the most articulate person, but I wanted to do my best to share some of my reasoning behind starting this thread...&nbsp; maybe you agree, maybe you don&#039;t.&nbsp; But at least I wanted anyone who reads this to at least know where I was / am coming from..<br /><br />Thanks for reading.... :)
