				the truth of the matter is murderface. I don&#039;t care. its unfortunate and its rude as hell for me to say it but not saying it wouldn&#039;t make it less true. my heart does not go out to you who is essentially in my mind an imaginary figure. the reality doesn&#039;t sink in and my empathy is pretty weak in general. Part of this whole suicide rant thing I&#039;ve been doing is an aknowledgment towards my lack of humanity. I know I don&#039;t care&nbsp; , I know the best solution thusly is prison or death and I know I don&#039;t want prison. get it?

Some people don&#039;t realise that things they take for granted like a good night&#039;s sleep in a comfortable bed IS a luxury. Suicide simply isn&#039;t an option for a lot of people because they&#039;re too busy dealing with LIFE. I think Tedrux is a troll and has a few drinks then comes on here looking for attention. The trick is not to feed the trolls I guess. Anyway Murder, I hope your situation gets brighter soon and you can at least spend the night under the same roof as your wife and kids &lt;3

				NO,DONT!!!<br /><br />This little troll has been ranting on about killing himself for months now.Fuck him and fuck his imaginary suicidal thoughts.If he really wanted to die,he would have found a way by now.If you ask him why he doesn&#039;t throw himself off a building he claims there are no tall buildings around him,drown and there&#039;s no rivers.Always a fucking excuse not to die.He&#039;s a fucking joke and mugs off anyone willing to listen or give him advice so I advise you to block this cunt before you feed him any attention at all.

				I live by a river. I don&#039;t know of any six story buildings around. imaginary thoughts is a confusing term- the thoughts might be my imagination but they aren&#039;t imaginary. they are there. all the time. I don&#039;t want to die. I started this post to get attention and I didn&#039;t even mask that and you are still calling me a troll but your wrong in this precise case because I wasn&#039;t fronting anything- I came out and said it. give me attention. how is it trolling to say exactly what you mean? if you weren&#039;t interested then just don&#039;t open the post. but you did. and you still didn&#039;t say why. I don&#039;t want to die. its scary. not the death part. just the part where im freaking out and cant breath or I&#039;m getting dizzy. if there was some way to skip all that I have no oppositioin to not being here on earth and I&#039;d take that option but thats not the way things work. I sort of wonder if people who look at those who talk about suicide wonder if that person wants pain or if they instead just want deletion and which part is the concern. I want no pain, I do want deletion. I dont have some sort of self worship that says I&#039;m worth being here on earth and oh how sad if I weren&#039;t. honestly some people would be hurt or whatever to some extent because thats humanity for you but overall in the long run its no great loss to them. I&#039;ve always either been withdrawln or outspoken with nothing to really say . as far as me being a joke- well, would you want to live as a joke? just fuck you.
