				Down for me as well. But remember source forums often have down time. Don&#039;t stress to much. I&#039;ll keep an ear to the ground and look for whats happening. <br /><br />Peace,<br />DigitalAlch

				Huh weird. I made an account once with no referral. Wonder if this was a glitch.. or if my account still exist. The thing I quickly glanced at seemed pretty expensive compared to alot of what is on here. And with it being forum styled it reminded me OSVD which I am not much of a fan of. I would be interested to sail around in there a bit more deeply. Gotta go check my account.<br /><br />~DigitialAlch

				TFM is like babby&#039;s first source board.&nbsp; It&#039;s good if your new to this game but it becomes extremely over priced once you find vendors outside of there.&nbsp; Good group of people though.

				I didn&#039;t even realize it was a source board. I stumbled upon it through the TOR DIRECTORY awhile back, remembered hearing the name, plugged the onion into SoS just to make sure and it was legit, so I signed up. I&#039;m registered at the store and forum, but the prices aren&#039;t really great compared to OVDB or Silk Road and the product offerings aren&#039;t as diverse. Its good for what it is though and I&#039;ll probably order something at some point, but let&#039;s put it this way: not knowing the address is nothing to lose sleep over.

				How do you access the store? It says you need a referral from somebody<br /><br />Id pay for an invite to a good source forum, it seems like SR is too commercial and everybody knows about it so people charge fucking outrageous prices.
