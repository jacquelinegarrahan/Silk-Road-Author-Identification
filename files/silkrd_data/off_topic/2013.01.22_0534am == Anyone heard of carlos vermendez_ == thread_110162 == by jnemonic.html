				Before i found SR, i was of course looking through all kinds of forums, etc.<br /><br />Found this guy Carlos who was a vendor, but not on SR, said he only uses Escrow, and he sounded legit.<br /><br />But this over 3 months ago.<br /><br />Because we exchanged email addresses, he sent me one last night saying do you want any pills or mdma, etc?<br /><br />I said no, theres too much risk. I asked are you a vendor on SR, he replied yes. I asked him for his name, and he replies Carlos Pain Meds.<br /><br />I looked this up, there is no Carlos Pain Meds vendor here.<br /><br />Was just wondering if anyone else had come across him earlier, well before finding the Road?<br /><br />I just found it weird that a vendor would email me after i said i wasnt interested months ago?<br /><br />Anyway thought i&#039;d put it out there. ;)<br /><br />MaidMandy, you have been bookmarked...mmm, mmm. :P

				Lol-lah. So much for keeping low-profile tonight (bad mood). :-\ [Edit. Lol-lah, just accidentally tried to order hash cookies from the pizza shop and she primly said they don&#039;t sell drugs ???

Is it the name? The same low-post username bump? The fact he appears Spanish? A couple of similarities..... hmm.... I&#039;d keep walking, jonny..... how ç Jesus of Rave/someone else?<br /><br />[Edit. Sorry, I closed the page. My finger slipped. :-\ ]<br /><br /><br />....... so basically no, not really. There is someone listed as carlos on SR and SR forums though, coincidentally sells eccies, but a little.... sus...... :-\ <br /><br /><br />TY for &quot;putting it ↑&quot;.<br /><br />Piece out.

You look ↑ enough shit for people on your shipping sticky thread (can&#039;t remember name, but you answered a question for me if I recall). :) If you&#039;re after eccies you&#039;re in luck; it&#039;s not a poorly-catered drug on SR, heard Jesus of Rave is good but can&#039;t back that from my own xp. :-\ TS bought from him.<br /><br />Piece out.
