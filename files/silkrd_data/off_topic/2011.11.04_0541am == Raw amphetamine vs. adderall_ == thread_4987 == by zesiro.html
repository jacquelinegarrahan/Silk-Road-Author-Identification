				Why can I buy 2g of amphetamine for $32 and only 100mg of adderall for $73? Aren&#039;t they the same thing? Does the brand really cost that much? If that&#039;s the case, who in their right mind would blow money on adderall pills when they can buy 20x more for 1/2 the price?<br /><br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/8526<br />http://ianxz6zefk72ulzz.onion/index.php/silkroad/item/9331

				I would actually very much like to know the answer to this, as well. I&#039;m in the market for some speed, and I&#039;d like to know which is more bang for my Bitcoin.<br />Could it be that since you have to dry the powder out to use it, you&#039;re not actually getting all 2g of product? How much of that weight is water that you dry/cook out?

				I want to know too. Seriously thinking in getting some of this stuff because i love amphetamines and i&#039;m growing tired of popping ritalins and adderalls. Given i can find both quite cheap locally (thank god for friends with scripts that like to trade drugs)... <br /><br />I think i&#039;m going to try it out soon... when i do i&#039;ll bump this thread... :)

				I&#039;ve been trying AA koven&#039;s amphetamine paste as an alternative to Adderall. I take it to get work done. It feels very similar, but I need to take more paste than I would Adderall. Typically I take 40mg of paste as a productivity enhancer, whereas I might take 10-20mg of Adderall. This puts paste cheaper than Adderall on a per-dose basis. The downside is that you are taking a street drug cooked up in a clandestine lab rather than a pharmaceutical drug, but eh, it feels the same and it&#039;s a lot cheaper.

				Adderall is produced in giant pharmaceutical labs. Speed paste is produced clandestinely. It&#039;s up to you what you want. Also, the Adderall on SR is way overpriced compared to typical street prices.

				I would like to hear more comparisons from people who have taken adderall and who have tried amphetamine paste from vendors on the road. As I&#039;m a huge fan of adderall but not of the prices it&#039;s offered for on here, I&#039;d like to find a less expensive alternative for my speed cravings.

				I tried some of mrouid&#039;s speed pills. Half of one felt like 15-20mg of Adderall. And since they&#039;re in pill format you have a reasonably standardized dose without any guesswork or weighing of minute quantities.

				So, if I were going for productivity and extreme weight loss, would you say I should go with speed paste, speed pills, or stick with Adderall? I use cannabis for my recreation, so I&#039;m not so much looking for a high, though I wouldn&#039;t turn one down. :)

Here&#039;s the thing though, if you smoke it, bang it, or snort it you&#039;ll probably end up doing all of it that way in a 3-4 day period. I have pretty good willpower but just to make sure I don&#039;t blow through my meds I mix it up with ground up excedrin or some DMAA, make a capsule, so that way I can only take it orally. I might save 20-30mg for a friday/saturday night but that&#039;s it.<br /><br />I used to snort/take big doses of adderall and ritalin when I was a teenager -- CMA is pretty close to all those but with more pronounced euphoria and a definite speed rush about it if you start taking more than threshold doses (5-10mg). 1 gram of CMA ($150-190) will last me well into 3-6 months as long as I&#039;m only taking one or two in the morning and never redosing until the next day or day after. That&#039;s a lot cheaper than buying 4 months supply of Adderall.

				Hope this does not come off wrong, but the answer is simple.&nbsp; <br /><br />It&#039;s *not* really drugs when you take it in pill form.&nbsp; Since my Dr. prescribes it, I&#039;m not doing anything wrong... [in the most sarcasm and factious mental voice possible.]&nbsp; <br /><br />I know, this is bullshit, but it&#039;s easier, for me, to rationalize eating 100 mg of adderall over doing a few lines.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with lying to yourself!

This is something I have never tried but definitely feel a strong attraction towards probably because of my love for d-amphetamine found in adderall. However there are so many terrible stories of meth ruining people&#039;s lives. I do think I could maintain a decent level of control by taking it infrequently and orally perhaps like sharetheroad suggested but are there any CMA users who could either verify the horror stories or vouch for the ability to use this drug in a safe manner? All input is greatly appreciated :)

				I&#039;ve always been able to keep Crystal Meth usage to a safe threshold, as I have other highly addictive drugs.&nbsp; But, the stories scare me too, and I stay away from it now (crystal anyway).&nbsp; And plus, I like my teeth.<br /><br />I do want to try the paste though - any recommendations on who can get it to the US reliably?
