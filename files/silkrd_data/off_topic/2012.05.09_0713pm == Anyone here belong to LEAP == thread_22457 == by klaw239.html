				Does anyone here belong to LEAP? &quot;law Enforcement against prohibition&quot;&nbsp; It is a group of law enforcement officers, DEA agents, senators, governors, Judges, presidents of other countries that are all for the legalization and decriminalization of all drugs across the board. <br /><br />http://www.leap.cc/<br /><br />The interviews with former heads of dea and narcotic agents and things they say will make you go wow.

				Please join LEAP at our annual conference and banquet on Riker&#039;s Island. Hosted by Internal Affairs. BYOB.<br /><br />I&#039;ve never heard of LEAP but looking it up now as it seems quite odd for a DEA agent to want to legalize ALL drugs, I could understand if it were just legalizing marijuana.

				I think organizations like leap are the most compelling entities in terms of pro legalization advocacy because they&#039;re composed of people who have enforced these laws and seen what the effect is first hand. It shows that some police actually possess a conscience and feel guilty about what they&#039;ve done to people, so much that they are compelled to try and reform the law. That guy who runs kopbusters is a good example I can&#039;t remember his name but a quick search would turn it up.<br /><br />Or maybe the cops are trying to trick people so they can surveil any citizen that chooses to affiliate with leap...
