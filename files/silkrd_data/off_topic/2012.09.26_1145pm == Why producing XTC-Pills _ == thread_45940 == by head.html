				Why would people produce XTC pills for selling? What&#039;s the point of it? The only good reason I can think of, it&#039;s easier for the party people to consume. I don&#039;t know of any other reasons why it would be good to produce XTC in pill form.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about profit in this business. So why would you produce XTC pills? You make alot more profit with selling crystal MDMA.<br /><br />If you can prove me wrong please make a sample calculation. I seriously doubt that.

				easier to transport, sell, plus people like how they have color or a logo.<br /><br />and im pretty sure the price can go either way. you could spend more on crystals or you could spend more on pills. take a browse through the ecstasy category on silk road

				im sure one of the best pills i ever taken (Yellow Rockstars) where a combination of MDMA &amp; Mephedrone.<br /><br />Unbelievable euphoria with an amazing sense of loved up, couldnt sleep a wink though &amp; felt a touch sketchy the next day.<br /><br />there was definately MDMA in it because of the Marquis test we performed, but there was some sort of amphetamine in it, definately not speed.<br /><br />possibly Drone, Maybe even Crystal Meth ;)

				Not being funny and I know it sounds silly, but comparing 200mg of Ivory&#039;s MDMA to a Blue Defqon on several occasions, the pills hit me a lot harder and more euphorically. <br />I could be chatting shit here but I do think that pills hit you harder, not sure how though.. maybe the pills had better MDMA in them I don&#039;t know but there is a subtle difference. <br /><br />This obviously isn&#039;t the case for all pills and crystal mdma though.

				we should all remember that in the 60s,70s and early 80s that MDMA was primarily used on the psychotherapists&#039; sofa &amp; not in raves.<br /><br />MDMA at home with friends = boo-yah<br />MDMA at a club - not so<br />Pills at a club - Yes baby.<br />MDMA + a stimulant at a club = MAOR POWERRR PLEAZ

Apart from any added extra that maybe in the pills are you aware that powder MDMA absorbs easier and quicker over crystal MDMA and so is easier to metabolize. <br /><br />Think about it. Powder goes into hot water, what happens? Dissolves almost instantly. What happens when crystals go into hot water? Takes a bit longer.

Will you make big profit with them in the long run? No. <br /><br />The problem was because there was nearly no MDMA on the market a few years ago. There was a precursor shortage. That&#039;s the reason why there were only shit pills on the market, without any mdma. People wanted XTC, but there was no mdma. So the producers just put some shit together and sold it as XTC, because the people wanted it.<br /><br />Now there is a new precursor available and there is a shitload mdma in the market again. 80% of the pills in the last two years are just middle to high dosed pure mdma pills. So what&#039;s even your point?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45940.msg488178#msg488178">Quote from: Limetless on September 27, 2012, 12:17 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Here is your maths - <br /><br />1g - £40-£50<br />1 pill - 150mg a pill = £10</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m talking about semi bulk prices. Just let say everything up to 1kg. Why would you even buy pills if you could buy pure MDMA cheaper and sell it for more?

				Yeah but still I dissolved the crystal into juice in a shot glass and downed it in one. Still didn&#039;t hit me as hard or as a euphorically. Weird! <br />But yeah crystal MDMA for the small gatherings and pills for the mad nights out.

And that&#039;s not that unusual here. Most pills are pure mdma and usually at 140-150mg. So that would be ~6500-7500 Pills. I think you should just accept that your maths was very wrong.<br /><br />http://s1.directupload.net/images/120927/qsbjx44r.jpg

				Brit pills are very different to the E.U ones mate, so no I am not wrong. Also you will find that people who manufacture pills don&#039;t just buy a couple of keys at a time and set up a hammer press, there are groups of major pill manufacturers and when you produce it at an industrial scale it really makes no difference if you make pills or sell it in weight. Sorry mate but you just haven&#039;t factored in all the different things that go into the economics of E pills.
