				there are those times, mostly fleeting feelings when it all comes together and you realize what drug use is all about and why we do what we do. (at least this is why i do it)<br /><br />times when your mouth hangs open, eyes watery, pupils like dinner plates.. when you say &quot;OMFG.. I didnt know this was possible..&quot; and life can litterally not get any better ;)<br /><br />for me it was DMT for sure, followed closely by my first candy flip experience, pure magic/spiritual experience<br /><br />what was it for you??

				MDMA, I look back on &#039;rollin experiences&#039; and get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about how it feels. Still haven&#039;t tried LSD and look forward to doing so, I can&#039;t imagine it being a better feeling than MDMA though.

				LSD.&nbsp; It has as much to do with the circumstances and environment in which I was dosing as with the effects of the drug itself.<br /><br />Nothing in my life before or since has ever compared to my mind opening up that first time.&nbsp; When everything came unhinged by those first few degrees.&nbsp; Acid was the very first psychedelic that I ever took.&nbsp; It was a strong dose, especially for a first time, at a VERY large concert.&nbsp; I should have been a hot mess, totally unfit for public display, but for some reason I was completely and totally at ease.&nbsp; Maybe it was the careless attitude of youth, coupled with the sheer awe I felt at touching what felt like another world, but it was a true-to-life &quot;nothing bad can happen&quot; time for me.&nbsp; No other substance has ever come close to taking me there again.

				Obvious answer for me would be the first time I smoked weed. <br /><br />I&#039;ve only ever had weed, granted. But it was the happiest I&#039;ve ever been. I&#039;d been depressed for about 2 weeks, and I decided to ask a friend of mine if I could try some. He said yes, I got high as fuck, and I was incredibly happy for the rest of the night.<br /><br />Definitely the best experience I&#039;ve ever had thus far.

				a combo i only first tried last year that blew my mind, its now my personal fave, take LSD and MDMA together (classic candy flip) then when the visuals start to peak rail a line of 2CB and prepare for awesomeness (oh and as with pretty much anything i ever list, its also combined with weed throughout)
