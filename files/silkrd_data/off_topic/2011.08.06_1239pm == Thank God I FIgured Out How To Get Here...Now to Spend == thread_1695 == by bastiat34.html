				Greetings to my fellow travelers on the Silk Road - <br /><br />I heard about this place about a month ago, but being a technological idiot - it took me some time to get in.<br /><br />Six and a half years ago I was diagnosed with cancer, and thankfully that was effectively treated - but during one of my operations to have the lymph node removed in my left inner thigh I think the surgeon must have spit in my leg. I ended up with flesh eating bacteria and spend 19 1/2 weeks in the hospital. When I arrived in the ER, which was packed because it was Labor Day weekend - the triage look took one look at me and brought me back straight away. My family was told I was unlikely to make it the next twelve hours...obviously I proved them wrong on that account too. <br /><br />But if I thought cancer was bad, the flesh eating bacteria was horrible. It&#039;s left me with such bad nerve damage that I can barely walk - and without strong pain medications at night I don&#039;t fall asleep until I&#039;m literally just so tired I pass out. <br /><br />I had been very lucky for 3 1/2 years to have a great doctor who took care of me. I was on 60mg of MS Contin 3 times daily and 12 to 16mgmg of Diluidid (3 or 4 pills) as needed, and also had lolipops for when things got really bad. I hardly ever took the lolipops because for some reason they made me puke like crazy. With the Diluidid I found that if I ate a couple of grapefruit about 30/40 minutes prior to taking them, and then just let them dissolve in my mouth it worked pretty well 75% of the time. For the extreme breakthroughs I&#039;d just let it sit in a spoon full of warm water for 15/20 minutes and then give myself a shot in the hip or shoulder - that seemed to work pretty well - not as well as a trip to the ER for IV - but they don&#039;t give those out too often and it takes forever - but pretty well overall. Prior to that he&#039;d had me on 5mg Oxymorphone IR for breakthrough&#039;s, but then about a two years ago he said he had stopped writing that script all together. I was also, at that point on Oxycontin, but he switched me to MS Contin - again said that unless someone had an allergy he was switching everyone over. My guess is that he figured those two are more likely to be abused or diverted, but I don&#039;t know for positive. <br /><br />Anyway - long story short 7 months ago two of his patients OD&#039;d and one was caught selling scripts over a period of a few months. I&#039;m sure you can image how many controlled scripts he writes now. <br /><br />I&#039;m in a western state where even cancer patients are literally often only given T3&#039;s or Vicoden still (everyplace in the US isn&#039;t Florida I guess :/ ) and up until the time of my cancer diagnosis I snorted meth several times a week and this in my medical records. This pretty much has made me a hot potato in terms of finding a new doctor. I&#039;ve gone from being involved in my kids and families life with a decent job to pretty much laying around in pain and misery all the time. <br /><br />So - like I said - I&#039;m just thankful that I have finally figured out how to get onto this forum! <br /><br />I have a couple of questions and hope some of you can provide me some direction here. <br /><br />When I signed up I noticed that &quot;bitcoin&quot; was a bit over $11 per unit, it&#039;s now down to near $9. Obviously if a person could time the market a little bit there would be advantages to it. For those of you who have been here awhile, what type of fluctuations does the price in the bitcoin market typically have in say a week? What&#039;s the most expensive you have seen it going for? What&#039;s the least? <br /><br />Next question - I still have not made my first purchase of bitcoin. What is a reputable place to buy online that is easily transferable here to the Silk Road? <br /><br />Now my last question. First of all though thank you guys for reading this far - I didn&#039;t mean to write half a book here - but I guess that&#039;s what this is turning into. <br /><br />When I make my purchase from someone do I they simply just send it regular mail? Should I create a &quot;fake&quot; name to have it come too? Or just have it come to my house. My worry about having a fake name is that I live in a pretty small town, 1400 people and about 40 miles from the nearest &quot;City&quot; which has about 70,000. Everyone knows everyone -I&#039;m in my mid thirties and the post man has been the post man here since I was a kid. <br /><br />Anyway thanks again for reading so much - and many thanks in advance to those of you who will be taking the time to help me out by answering my questions.

				@bastiat34-wow, something I never thought existed...a person coming to SR for actual chronic pain, rather than recreation!&nbsp; Welcome, you are a rare breed, just like unicorns.<br /><br />I had the same quandries you&#039;re having when I first came to SR about purchasing bitcoin, using my real name, etc.<br /><br />First, go to Dwolla, that is an online bank that will accept a wire from your bank and then you can transfer that money to either Mt. Gox or Tradehill, they both will exchange your USD for bitcoin with minimal fees.&nbsp; Dwollas fees are also minimal, but they take about 10 days to set up and do your first transfer and then about 5 days each time thereafter.&nbsp; If you want to have continuous bitcoin to spend, you have to plan a couple weeks ahead (one to do the BTC exchange, one to get a shipment).<br /><br />As far as speculating on the BTC, I&#039;d say absolutely FORGET IT.&nbsp; There are a zillion factors that affect its value; but you can go to the Bitcoin Forums at bitcoin.org and read all about it to get the background info.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in that small of a town, just use your real name but maybe only the first initial and change one letter in your last name, like this: J. Bloe.&nbsp; That way you have a degree of plausible deniability if you get a fairly decent sized package of opiates...which it appears is what you&#039;ll be needing.<br /><br />I buy opiates here as well and I can highly recommend two sellers: MrDdroMcGillacutty or chronicpain.&nbsp; CP has no listings currently, but he&#039;ll be back soon I&#039;m sure.&nbsp; There is a third very good one, envious, but recently his existence has been given the title of a &quot;fable&quot; (ignore that last line, that&#039;s just in case he happens to read this.&nbsp; little inside joke).&nbsp; Envious is also reliable and honest.<br /><br />I know nothing about the other opiate sellers but I can tell you that so far every seller who has listed heroin for sale here in the last 60 days has turned out to be either a full-on scammer or a selective scammer.&nbsp; You might want to avoid that altogether.<br /><br />If you stick to purchasing BTC only when you need them, then spending them quickly, you won&#039;t have much risk of devaluation and you can control what prices you pay. <br /><br />Hopefully that should get you going. :)&nbsp; Next time someone asks these questions, you can repay the favor and be the one to tell them how to get started...sound good? :D<br /><br />p.s. if you are thinking about selling your dilaudid or MS Contin to purchase something else on SR, give me a pm and maybe we can make a deal, eh? ;)

				My handle......bp? It isn&#039;t for British Petroleum. It&#039;s back pain.<br />I have to work (as in think and then physically act, in challenging positions for extended periods) for a living and some days I can barely move. The chiropractor stopped having much effect months ago.<br />Around here doctors look at you like you are an addict if you even suggest something for pain. The only people who get anything are people in some type of legal case and they get the permascripts.<br /><br />Now, do I enjoy the buzz from some hydros? Yes, but that doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m still not largely unable to make my living when it really hurts.<br />So I have come here and pay 100 times what something I should be able to buy OTC (what business it is of anyone&#039;s what I put in MY body) is worth or costs to produce.<br /><br />Even so I don&#039;t want the shit that makes me so high I can&#039;t function. I need to function. As most of us know, after a period of time on Vicodin the high becomes less important than the comedown....and the pain.<br /><br />The LAW sucks (as the original Bastiat pointed out in the 1850&#039;s...really, read &quot;The Law). It&#039;s about drug companies profits, the CIA&#039;s profits and conditioning people into actually believing some group of assbags really has some right to tell YOU what YOU can do with the property that is your body.<br /><br /><br />BTW, glad you made, hope your not a cop.

				There are significant number of people on Silk Road who are here for medication (as they describe it).<br /><br />It is ok with me if you are a cop, this would be one of the best/ safest places for a cop who needed something to buy it.

				Make sure to to research the vendor on these forums before you buy! 90+ rating is a good start but its still a gamble. Haven&#039;t had anything but glowing experiences from sellers who post and are reviewed here. I&#039;m somewhat new here also but a long time geek. Feel free to PM me if u have any technical type questions. Good luck and have fun!

				I recommend aromatics for fentanyl.&nbsp; I recommend weed to supplement the pain killers, help with relaxation, help with appetite, and help relieve the nausea from strong opiates.<br /><br />When I first got here (I was early).&nbsp; Bitcoin was worth a little more than a dollar.&nbsp; I bought 600 dollars worth and stayed extremely high all summer as the bitcoin continued to climb (worth 30 at it&#039;s highest point.&nbsp; I&#039;m still extremely stocked up on nearly every hallucinogen.<br /><br />As far as when to buy, now is a pretty safe time.&nbsp; It&#039;s recently tanked and it will slowly climb.&nbsp; If you can get it low and buy when value is peaking you can get like 2 to 3 times the drugs for your money.<br /><br />Best of luck.&nbsp; Glad you found a solid hookup for your needs.&nbsp; It&#039;s a pity when guy can&#039;t get drugs for recreation, a tragedy when he can&#039;t get them for much needed pain relief.....
