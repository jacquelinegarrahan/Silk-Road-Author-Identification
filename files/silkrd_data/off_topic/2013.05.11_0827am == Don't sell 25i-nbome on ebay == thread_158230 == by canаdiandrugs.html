				In many countries it is still legal to be sold as a RC, as long he doesn&#039;t directly advertise the psychoactive effects on humans (if he implied that he would sell it for human consumption it would be illegal).&nbsp; I don&#039;t really see anything wrong with it, if people buy it he makes quite a huge profit, even if he did doesn&#039;t buy NBOMe in bulk I blotter wouldn&#039;t even cost him more than 25ct each to manufacture, so for every 4 blotter he sells me makes at least 2400% profit. If there are many clueless people who are willing to pay those prices then this guy will make a lot of money with almost no effort, for as long it stays unscheduled and/or other people enter the market and bring down the price.
