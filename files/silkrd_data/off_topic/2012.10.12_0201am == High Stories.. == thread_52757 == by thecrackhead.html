				Ok so the idea of the topic is to share funny, bizarre, retarded stories that occurred while we were high. <br /><br />I guess I have to start...<br /><br />I was a bit younger and I was dealing mephedrone from my apartment, a small town, in a small country in Europe. From time to time I was asking few good friends to come over so we could snort our brains out. We were never going for more than 5 consecutive nights because we were aware of the fact that after 6 days the body could just give up. It was I think the fourth night with no sleep or food apart from one soup I believe, Instead since Monday we were drinking Fanta Lemon (only fanta lemon =]]). At some point we went downstairs to buy some more liquids and as we got into the shop my friend asked for a fanta lemon :D. As soon as he finished the sentence I got on my knees and started screaming &quot;fanta lemon again?!&quot;. No need to mention that the cashier was more puzzled than a ho in church. After I realized what I did I stood up trying to look normal and of course I asked for a fanta lemon. My friend started laughing so hard that he had&nbsp; to leave the store.<br /><br />I would really enjoy to read stories alike from u guys :).<br /><br />Peace.

				Would have been more suitable in Off Topic section, but I assume it will be moved next time a moderator sees it. Being in spirit of this thread, I will too, post a story that happened while high.<br /><br />This was back when I was a youngster. In High School. Not selling drugs, just consuming. Well anyways me and my friends were spending 4/20 together. I wish I could re-create the memorable experiences that is Childhood, but I unfortunately have been unable to. I remember laughing, bonding, having a fantastic time all while we were all high off our asses. I recall getting so high that time &quot;slowed-down&quot; like it would on mushrooms. Also had sensations of deja-vu that day intensely. Just fucking around being kids not a care in the world. Ahh, good times.<br /><br />Not much of a story, but shit, I can&#039;t think of anything AWESOME to post right now, will get back to it later ;)
