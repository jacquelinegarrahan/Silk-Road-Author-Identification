				Ok, so I&#039;m bored with the site being down.&nbsp; Dunno if this has been done before :)<br /><br />For me, most recent was opiates and Game of Thrones<br />Most comedies but definitely have fond memories with weed - Anchorman and Dumb and Dumber certainly top the list<br />Best trip experience and movie - LSD and Under Siege, pretty sure Steven Segal saved my life during that movie<br /><br />Love the benzo+weed experience although I tend to have no recollection of most of the movie the next day.

				3mg of 25i HCL tabs and Tim and Eric&#039;s Billion Dollar Movie. <br /><br />It was a religious experience and to this day if I have someone come over who hasn&#039;t seen it I force 3 bong loads into their minds and sit em down for it. Kind of like disciples spreading the gospel. But with a movie. And weed.<br />

				2 grams of good homegrown mushrooms and.... Spy Kids 3D in an empty theatre with a good friend. Best time of my life. Laughed my ass off all throughout. Absolutely ridiculous movie on mushrooms. I know it&#039;s a dorky sounding kids&#039; movie, but trust me, you&#039;ll piss your pants laughing for an hour if you ever get the chance!<br /><br />And of course weed + good comedies like Dumb &amp; Dumber is classic! BTW, looks like another Dumb &amp; Dumber movie with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels is in the works!<br /><br />The Matrix on LSD pretty much makes you feel like doing that stuff is actually possible. And is all-around awesome.

				Massive bowls of post-ban spice and Enter the Void.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t tell if the opening credits were flashing from the spice or if they were actually flashing.

				Enter The Void is fucking spectacular, high or sober. Really fantastic stuff.<br /><br />I find that nature documentaries (esp. with baby animals) taken with mushrooms help me re-discover a sense of wonderment.<br />

				I did the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; + Wizard of Oz while on LSD, that was interesting albeit not quite as impressive as I had heard.
