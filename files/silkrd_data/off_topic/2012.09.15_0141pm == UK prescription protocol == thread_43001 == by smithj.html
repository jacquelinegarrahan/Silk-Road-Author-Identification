				Hi there, this is really meant for fellow UK dwellers<br /><br />Ive managed to get a couple of empty prescription sheets from a GP and want to fill them with <br />Oxycontin.<br />&nbsp;I know exactly what to write and how to fill it in correctly. However I am unsure of what checks the pharmacist does. <br /><br />Do they have to call the prescribing doctor??<br /><br />I have called a few pharmacists and they don&#039;t seem to stock Oxycontin and order it in when and if they need it they seem to be able to get it within the day. Is this time spent checking details?<br />&nbsp;<br />Im thinking of getting a fake id to protect my identity.<br /><br />Does anyone have any advice? Thanks a lot<br />

				My understanding is that they will definitely check on new customers with prescriptions for this sort of drug. You&#039;ll also have to look into how to print them properly and fake a stamp.<br /><br />You&#039;d be better off trying to sell the sheets I imagine.

				My last script was just on headed paper with the docs ref number (apparently they can rock up at a pharmacy and just quote that number and get anything). <br /><br />As others have said though anything with more recreational value will probably be more carefully checked especially if not done in a standard quantity/dose (which a pharmacist would know v well) - if it&#039;s not ready on the spot I wouldn&#039;t take the chance as they almost def will call the doc if you show up with some script for 20 IR Oxy...

Is it a green script or a blue one? I&#039;m not sure, but don&#039;t things like Oxy and Diamorphine have to be written on a (non-repeatable) blue script? Also, don&#039;t go to small pharmacy where they&#039;d know all the local doctors signatures and hand writing off-by-heart (you probably already know this).
