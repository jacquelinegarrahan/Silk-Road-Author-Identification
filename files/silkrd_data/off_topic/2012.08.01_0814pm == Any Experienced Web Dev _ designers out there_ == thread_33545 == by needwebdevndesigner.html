You go to a website DEDICATED to making websites (which is probably where you should be in the first place) asking for somebody to sell you drugs.<br /><br />Seriously dont you think there are better places to search for these services than on deepweb?

				the nature of the website I do not think someone on a legitimate website would be interested in doing nor would i be disrespectful enough in order to contact someone with an illegal offer over clearnet, <br /><br />If you arent developer or designer interested in making money then i dont see why it is necessary to post, if you wanna shit on me saying how im dumb for not going to a different website maybe you should consider that ive already thought about things and where im searching is the best spot? <br /><br />ive already had an offer or two show up so appreciate the 2 cents, but the nature of what i want deepweb and being anonymous is the best thing <br /><br />thanks
