				Hi there. This is quite the first-world problem, but it would make my life about 6 seconds easier each time if vendors had their SR URL&#039;s on a separate line, such as this:<br /><br />&quot;Vendor Link:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/b457d10208&quot;<br />(also, try his weed. Serioulsy - awesome vendor)<br /><br />This allows me to simply double click the address, right-click on &quot;open in new tab&quot; and my lazy fingers don&#039;t have to work the mouse to select the address, as opposed to this:<br /><br />&quot;Seller Acccount- http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/693c03ff71&quot;<br />(I don&#039;t know this vendor - just the first example I could find)<br /><br />But please at least put your SR page in your sig!

				It should auto-highlight the url when you double click regardless. What browser are you using?

				Ew Ice Weasel :P. Try firefox, what I&#039;m using. No it&#039;ll appear as text, but if you double-click the url it should highlight JUST the url as long as there is spaces and shit between the url and other text.

				Hmm, tails, I forgot that there isn&#039;t any persistence for it. I personally use LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) and installed tor etc by myself so I had better control over the distro. Anything happens plug it into my netbook, format, done.<br /><br />If you&#039;re willing to give up some security for more convenience I would try LMDE and install TOR and GPG etc by yourself (google is your best friend here)<br /><br />I&#039;m not surprised, not the biggest fan of Ice Weasel here :P. Newer firefox will let you highlight just the url I believe (if not I&#039;m not sure why it works on my computer lol)

				Well I&#039;m by far a linux expert, but persistence would mean it backs up everything (correct me if I&#039;m wrong) as it does on my debian install. <br /><br />I was actually recommended tails as well, I&#039;m just picky about my functionality and interface :)
