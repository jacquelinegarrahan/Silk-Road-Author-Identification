				So does anyone know if camdecoy.com is a scam or if its real?&nbsp; It seems to me it could cause a lot of mischief if its real.&nbsp; Also seems to me someone would be selling it either here or at BMR if it existed....?<br />

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=26658.msg287983#msg287983">Quote from: cache on June 13, 2012, 12:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">What does it purport to do?<br />I am not going to be clicking that link, no offence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Basically, it is a fake webcam feed with a model that you can control to do different things so the person on the other end of the webcam thinks they&#039;re really talking to them (no sound, just typing)<br /><br />So for example, a scammer could put up this webfeed of this model and the victim would think they were really talking to hot girl/hot guy because the person appears to be responding to them, but it is the scammer clicking on the different actions for the model to do and writing what they are saying.<br /><br /><br />&quot;CamDecoy is the most advanced fake webcam system available on the market today. No, this is not some software to play your video clips over your webcam, or some app to allow you to add some silly graphics over your webcam stream. CamDecoy is a sophisticated tool that has many uses, once you learn what the system can do, you will come up with your own creative ideas on how to make use of it.<br /><br />Private Investigators<br />Example: You cannot locate someone to serve him/her with papers, they refuse to answer your calls. But you know they have a Facebook or some other sort of social networking or dating site account. You can use one of our attractive male or female model photos to create a fake social networking site or dating account, you can lure them into talking to you and use our cam system to close the deal. This is just one of hundreds of uses for private investigators.<br /><br />Intelligence Agencies<br />Example: Using attractive people for espionage missions is nothing new. People trust webcams, in these days when people meet new people on photo they demand “hey turn on your webcam”. Well now with CamDecoy you can turn it on alright, you have full control of so many different things so even if they ask you to wave or show a state ID you can do that, read more below on these techniques. We cannot go into every scenario here but use your imagination.<br />Testing a Spouse<br />Example: Will your boyfriend or husband fall for another girl? What would he tell another girl about you? Will your girlfriend or wife fall for another guy? What would she tell him about you? With CamDecoy you can really get lots of information that in many cases will shock you and or set your mind at ease.<br /><br />Pranksters<br />Example: The things some guys do for some hot looking girl, how about what girls would do for a hot rich super wealthy guy? I bet your mind is working right now of so many cool things you can do. This is not just some app that streams a video of a girl typing, you can do some of the most amazing tricks with this app and it tricks even the most skeptical person.<br /><br />Private cam show business<br />Example: Cater to the billion dollar industry of private cam shows. Tons of guys everyday go online to talk to some cam girl and pay for her to do a show for her. With Cam Decoy you can talk to guys, invite them into a chat room hosted by us or on your own server (no extra charge) and then have them pay you for a show. Obviously at that point you play a special clip that makes the girl do a complete adult show for them. In the phone sex business for many years 300lb girls told callers they are 125lbs, now we are making this happen in the WebCam business. Obviously once you ask someone to pay you have to make sure to abide by any laws pertaining to false advertising.<br />No webcam required: You do not need a webcam to use the CamDecoy system.&quot;<br /><br />
