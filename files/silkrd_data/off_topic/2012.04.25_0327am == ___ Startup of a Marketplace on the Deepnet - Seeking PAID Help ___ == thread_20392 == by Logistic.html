				Hello,<br /><br />I&#039;d like to first say that I am NOT wanting to create another Silk Road. I absolutely love the Silk Road and what it is doing here. I&#039;m not in any way trying to create competition (although in a sense I am) and I myself have been a Silk Road buyer/seller for many months. My identity will not be revealed as I will continue to use SR even after my own project has been completed. I am very respected here and you will not be able to pick me out; please don&#039;t waste your time trying.<br /><br />Let&#039;s start. TOR and Bitcoins allow for an amazing amount of anonymity, as we so obviously see every time we place an order here at the Road. I too, would like to use both of these resources to create a Marketplace for buyers to buy from and sellers to sell from, anonymously. I have some brand new ideas for my Marketplace that I do not wish to share until the release. Expected opening will be sometime this summer.<br /><br />I&#039;m investing some money into this project and am eagerly seeking new programmers to help build the site along with me and others. Payment can be agreed upon and I wouldn&#039;t even mind hiring sometime to work with the site full-time. Along with my new ideas that will incorporate what we all know and love here, I feel my Market will do better than BMR, yet I do NOT want a rivalry between my site and the SR. The most important thing is giving customers what they want in a safe, secure manner. <br /><br />If you can code, design, or feel you have something to offer. Use the below email. Provide any details you feel necessary. I will have to see some sort of portfolio of work before hiring. Know that you are designing a marketplace and doing nothing illegal. You still want to take all necessary precautions for obvious reasons that I feel I do not need to explain. You will never know my name or what I sell by here. Saying that says enough, but not enough to narrow me down at all.<br /><br />Email: Logistic@tormail.org<br /><br />All payments will be in BTC. Do not email if you have nothing to offer. <br />&nbsp;8)<br /><br />Thanks for your time,<br /><br />-Logistic
