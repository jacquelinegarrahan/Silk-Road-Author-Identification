				Hey all, wanted to share this story with you :) <br /><br />For the purposes of this story, and anonymity, I will call the person Claire, thats not her real name though obviously. <br /><br />Claire, is a friend of my mothers, not a friend she has met yet, but nether the less for the past year and half or so she has been talking to her daily on facebook, playing farmville together (lol lord help me) and talking on the phone etc.<br /><br />Well back in Jan 2010, Claire had a simplistic and not the most sophisticated of grow sets up, she was growing Marijuana strictly for her own personal and medicinal use.<br /><br />See, I live in North England, my mothers friend lives in South Eastern England, and in a pretty rural place, no dealers anywhere near and she lives alone in her house, she&#039;s in her late 40&#039;s by the way.<br /><br />Claire was in a car accident a few years ago which left her with some really bad pain that never lets her be, she has a bunch of prescription pain killers she was forced to rely on, so she decided to try and grow her own.<br /><br />Well, somehow the fucking police found out, I cant even think how and they raided her house, and took everything, the worst part? 3 weeks from harvest.. <br /><br />Well this is a story I&#039;ve only recently found out about, when I did, I rang her up and told her I could help her out.<br /><br />Well, she hadn&#039;t smoked in a long time but was definitely interested and wanted to start on something not to strong, So I recommended I get her 5g of RooiBard from Swazibuds and explained its outdoor grown sativa should be perfect to start smoking again with.<br /><br />Well, I ordered it, and a week and a half later had it and was very happy, thanked me a million times and told me how she can now comfortably get to sleep at night and have a good restful nights sleep.<br /><br />When OrganicBuds with his great offer came along I snatched her one up :D so now she has some of that strong stuff, and I&#039;ve told her she can contact me when she&#039;s running low.<br /><br />Obviously I cant just buy her these things, nice idea but my young broke ass can just about afford to take care of himself, she&#039;s sent me the price I paid via bank, didn&#039;t make any profit, infact thanks to stupid BTC fluctuations I lost a few quid but ah well! whats helping people ^_^<br /><br />

				Very kind of you! Many of my customers have tried products from the SR and feel the price is worth the quality. Around these parts ounces cost around 3-400 usd for medical quality (no mold pest ect_)

				That&#039;s so cool.&nbsp; Very good example why weed should just be legal everywhere already.&nbsp; It&#039;s ridiculous.<br /><br />Good on you for helping someone in need!&nbsp; I&#039;m fairly certain that SR helps some chronic pain patients get the medication they need to live a decent quality life when it would otherwise be unavailable to them.&nbsp; If only Gawker would write articles about things like this.

				This is why weed should be legal. I just like getting high, but for some people it&#039;s the only medicine that helps.<br />That was a nice thing to do Rassu322, especially for a northener! :P

				It&#039;s only a matter of time before it&#039;s legalized as the older misinformed generations are replaced with the generations who understand how harmless marijuana is and the potential for an entirely new taxable market.<br /><br />I have been providing my Grandma with shake to make cookies and an occasional rolled joint for years, she went through a bout with cancer some years back and has been disabled ever since. She never had an appetite problem during chemo but after becoming disabled she has been on a variety of pain meds for her legs, she never wants to overdo them since her brother became an addict some years back after his major surgery, so rather than upping doses she just thaws out some cookies (she bakes large batches then freezes them) and hopefully take a nap.
