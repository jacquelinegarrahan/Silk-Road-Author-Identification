Well....not worth the effort, is it?

				<br /><br />Listen dipshits. You don&#039;t need the secrecy of Tor to buy a hooker online. You use an escort web site. If you are a cheap bastard and can only afford some crack whore then you&#039;re gonna have to go on the street to find one and then you become a John and that&#039;s illegal.<br /><br />You can look up a classy woman on an escort site and she can be round your place munching on your dick in a couple of hours if you&#039;re lucky.

				if you find a sex worker willing to come to your house you got the dumbest most desperate junkie around or LE. that could so easily be any kind of ambush for her. there are brothels aplenty around most cities if you know the right people and places. good escort agencies vet the johns before they get near the ladies. <br />what you need is a sex and drug loving booty call. unfortunately this is where social skills come into play. try forming real life relationships gradually and work from there. it helps if you are generally clean and not creepy. or hang around crack whores. <br />the whole reckless online hookup is more popularly a gay guy thing. maybe give that a try. forgive me if this is just a stereotype but some are very fond of ghb and meth. sure do love some cock though. ;)

				Try one of those websites for cheating married people. The chicks on there are all looking for no strings attached sex. PLUS you won&#039;t have to listen to all the wedding/baby/monogamy crap because her husband already does.
