				Okay so I like caffeinated foods but that shit&#039;s totally overpriced so I like to make it myself. Caffeine pills taste gross though so crushing them up and using the powder ruins the taste of the food. For this extraction method you only need isopropyl alcohol and common kitchen supplies:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I use at least ten caffeine pills (200mg of caffeine each)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; isopropyl alcohol (water should work too but it will decrease your yield and maybe purity)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mortar and pestle<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; measuring cup<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jar ~200mL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jar ~300mL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; jar &gt;100mL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; microwave<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; filter paper or coffee filter<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; funnel<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; dish with flat bottom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ice<br /><br /><br />Procedure:<br />Use the mortar and pestle to crush the pills into a fine powder and put it into the 200mL jar.<br />Measure out 100mL of isopropyl alcohol and use it to rinse residual powder from the mortar and pestle into the 200mL jar.<br />Stir the mixture and put it into the microwave and set it to &#039;defrost&#039;. Turn on the microwave for one minute and check the temperature with your fingers. Repeat until touching the jar for too long is painful (temperature should be 60°-70°C).<br />Take the jar out of the microwave, stir the mixture and, using the funnel, pour it through the filter paper into the 300mL jar. As soon as the hot mixture hits the cold glass, you should see the caffeine crystallize.<br />Measure out another 50mL of alcohol and put it in the 200mL jar. Swirl that shit and repeat the heating process. Pour the mixture into the 300mL jar. You should now have about 150mL of fairly pure caffeine solution.<br />Take the dish with the flat bottom and prepare an ice bath in it. I use crushed ice and I also add salt to lower the water temperature even more. Put the jar with the mixture into the ice bath.<br />Measure out 100mL of alcohol and pour it into the &gt;100mL jar. Put the jar into the ice bath too. Stirring the mixture and the alcohol may speed up the cooling process.<br />When both jar&#039;s contents have reached 10°C or lower, prepare another filter and pour the mixture into it. You don&#039;t need the filtrate so you can do it over a sink and let the alcohol drain away.<br />Use the chilled alcohol to rinse the 300mL jar multiple times.<br />After all the alcohol has drained through the filter, put the filter in a well ventilated place to dry. Once dry, scrape the caffeine off the filter and store it in a dry place.
