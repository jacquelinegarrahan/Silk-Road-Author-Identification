				If you are actually serious about killing yourself, then I&#039;d suggest don&#039;t. As it says somewhere in the extras on the Lord of the Rings DVD, no-one on this earth can know for 100% what will happen in the future, so giving in to despair and hopelessness is not only pointless it&#039;s illogical! You never know what your life might be like one year from now. <br /><br />As someone who has been through depression and suicidal thoughts, I&#039;m glad to say I came though that shit and if I&#039;d have known then what my life would be like now, I definitely wouldn&#039;t have killed myself. Also killing yourself is a supremely selfish act, you&#039;ve got parents right? Then, if not for yourself, don&#039;t do it for their sakes.<br /><br />If you are just trolling then fuck you. :)

I&#039;m sure I&#039;d be hurting somebody though...<br /><br />If your completely miserable, and things haven&#039;t changed in years, well, is it okay to kill yourself maybe? btw if anyone would donate a needle that would be awesome.

				Hi hun, please don&#039;t kill yourself.&nbsp; But if you are totally intent on it why not try to go out with a bang(so long as you don&#039;t do anything violent) like smuggling 10 kilos of coke from Colombia and just kill yourself if you get caught, if you don&#039;t then you be rich and will have such a great life that you will not want to die anymore and you can help your family

You&#039;re sovereign over your own body, and have the power to end your life if that&#039;s what you wish to do.<br />It&#039;s OKAY to kill yourself, but personally I&#039;d recommend waiting it out.<br />When you&#039;re in a deep hole suicide sometimes seems like the only option. The flip side of that is that life can&#039;t get any worse, and can only get better!! Wait it out, kid. I guarantee it&#039;ll be worth it.&nbsp; ;)

				Stop taking drugs mate. Some people just can&#039;t handle them. Sounds like you are one of them. Stop doing drugs, give it a month and see how you feel after that - after a month your brain should be more chemically balanced and you&#039;ll see things more clearly, and you should be past any withdrawal depression as well.<br /><br />Exercise and eat well, then show your bastard folks you don&#039;t need them. Show a bit of independence and they&#039;ll be more likely to accept you back into their lives.

				I severely doubt this is true, i tried to kill myself but i kept a pretty fucking tight lid on that shit let alone telling strangers. You need confidence for that, right now maybe you just need some attention. This seems attention seeking to me. This is not the way to get it unless you want to be fucked in the arse. But yeh i was in hospital for this shit over a stupid fucking girl nonetheless, although not as stupid as i was being. Attention seeking is HOLE DIGGING. Take it from me i fucking know this shit like the cracks in my favorite coffee mug. <br /><br />You post kinda pissed me off, if its true i know where your at.... puberty.

				Read Adyashanti, Eckhardt Tolle, or a spiritual teacher of your choice.<br /><br />Your suffering is your cross to bear. It&#039;s almost unbearable but it can be done. Bear it and eventually (it may take years) you will realize that we make ourselves miserable or happy. It&#039;s hard work either way you decide to go. The trick is in what you emphasize.

I know this to be fact because he told me where he lives. The day he wrote this post, he&#039;d messaged me prior on SR, admitting he&#039;d intentionally lied and deceived me out of $220 10 days ago, stated he would do the right thing by paying me the amount he owed, and claimed to be so very remorseful for being a POS. I replied back saying I&#039;d couldn&#039;t trust a damn word of the diarrhea flowing from his mouth. That&#039;s when suicide talk began, in his response using the exact same words, verbatim, he also wrote here, &quot; Do you think if I rail a gram of black tar I might die?&quot; I decided to end all contact because his attention-seeking behavior had gone so far beyond what I am willing to tolerate.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=42999.msg467845#msg467845">Quote from: topstopplop on September 16, 2012, 01:45 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I severely doubt this is true, i tried to kill myself but i kept a pretty fucking tight lid on that shit let alone telling strangers…This seems attention seeking to me…<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Nail on the head…and his own words tell the world far more than I&#039;m sure he intended: OutOfTouch20 (aka Cannibal1 and Moonbear)&nbsp; decided to announce to a forum of strangers his &quot;plan&quot; (exploiting the basic human decency of strangers to gain their empathy/sympathy, knowing most responses will filled with words that praise him and wanting to hear how much he &#039;deserves&#039; to live. Ego boost, short-term. OutOfTouch even goes the extra mile for bonus points by asking the forum to actually send him &#039;something&#039; to kill himself with. He then discusses who he thinks he would emotionally hurt if he committed suicide. And although there are 100 more examples of attention-seeking tactics and not suicidal, I&#039;ll end with this one: A suicidal person will not ask a bunch of damn strangers if it&#039;s okay to off himself…&quot;is it okay to kill yourself maybe?&quot; I guess if your answer to him is yes, he once again asks strangers to send him a needle to use in a supposed suicide attempt.<br /><br />OutOfTouch, I really believe you desperately need to seek help, but not for being suicidal, imo, but instead need help because it was such an incredibly sick, narcissistic ploy to drag complete strangers into your distorted reality and use them as your support system for a temporary boost to your ego. You make a choice every day not to seek help and better yourself. There are a lot of free resources to chose from but you&#039;re too damn weak to admit you have serious issues, choosing instead to drag strangers through yet another of your draining experiences. Your disgusting tactics to using emotional manipulation and basic decency are shameless and unconscionable. You only fool yourself into believing you can rely on that tactic to work every time and think every stranger will respond by rolling over and allow you to have your way. <br /><br />Only a narcissist could love to use the threat of suicide as much as you do to get attention whenever they want it. You have taken your emotional manipulation to a new level by telling these people you&#039;re going to off yourself and then disappear from the forums so they&#039;ll wonder if you really followed through with killing yourself. And I feel sure you come to this forum every day to see if anyone wrote about OutOfTime&#039;s suicide posts. Even Satan himself couldn&#039;t come up with anything worse than having to live in your shoes.<br /><br />Silk Road is not your personal therapy. They are not equipped professionally or organizationally to deal with your situation so quit expecting it. You seem to be a depressed low-functioning addict and yet you refuse to even help yourself, preferring instead to come to the forum to manipulate the kindness of strangers. <br />&nbsp;But don&#039;t worry…I didn&#039;t take you seriously when you said you&#039;d do the right thing by sending me the $220 for those Lortab you stole. Maybe today is the day to take one small step toward quitting the begging, lying, and stealing to fund an addiction just so you don&#039;t feel anything…Teenhelp.org (I am in no way affiliated with this site- it&#039;s just an one free place of many) I have great compassion for every suicidal person but, imo, you&#039;re a manipulative, depressed addict, but not suicidal. This is the last time I participate in your games and do not message me on SR.

				@ OperationPsyops I totally agree, from my experience suicidal people just do it. Moonbear was just attention seeking. Still, it&#039;s in my nature to answer a cry for help. But now I see he&#039;s a scamming lowlife who has tried this before, I couldn&#039;t care less.<br /><br />Moonbear sort your life out, it&#039;s not that hard.

				Jumping in at the end. Haven&#039;t read the reast of the thread.<br /><br />Wanting out of this life is normal, at times. for all humans. Work through it. If you can&#039;t work through it, nature shows a way. You stop taking food. Hunger hurts a little at first until you make friends with it. It tells you whether you&#039;re really ready or not. If you&#039;re not ready, you&#039;ll eat something. If you&#039;re really ready, you&#039;ll push through the hunger and have some insights. If you still don&#039;t change your mind and decide to continue with the difficult process of human life you will become weak from lack of food. When you are tired and ready, you can stop taking water. Soon after you stop taking water, you life process will end. It is nature&#039;s way we need to re-learn nature&#039;s way.<br /><br />But yeah, don&#039;t do it a place where you&#039;ll get eaten by wolves or dogs. Of if you want, you can do that.<br /><br />None of this requires illegal drugs. Please don&#039;t put this forum at risk by requesting suicide drugs that are totally unnecessary. This is natures way.<br /><br />My guess is that this is not your time to pass or you are law enforcement/entrapment trying to smear the life enhancing business that is going on here at Silk Road. If the former, my prayers go out to you. If the latter, see if you have some cousins, relatives someone, who can teach about plant medicine. Namaste.

				People who wanna kill themselves just do it and people don&#039;t hear from themselves again. People who have suicidal thoughts but won&#039;t go through with it and want attention, post on the SR forums claiming that they&#039;re gonna kill themselves. You sir, are the latter.

Cyanide isn&#039;t meant for consumption and if we find out that you&#039;ve used this product for this reason, YOUR ACCOUNT HERE WILL BE TERMINATED That&#039;s right, you won&#039;t be able to withdraw your bitcoins or anything. So think twice about the potential ramifications before you attempt this. <br /><br />I&#039;m going to assume this was your attempt at a sick joke and that you want to acquire cyanide for legitimate reasons, which honestly is about 100x more likely. If that&#039;s the case, check out my review thread of current cyanide vendors here! : <br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=66664.0
