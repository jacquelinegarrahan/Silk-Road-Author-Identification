				Honestly, if you&#039;re not looking to forget, the best thing to allow you to experience the pain is sobriety. If you are looking to dull the pain, an SSRI might be useful. I&#039;d turn to alcohol as my first instinct, but there&#039;s no way that&#039;s good for you psychologically.

				We&#039;ve all been through this (or something similar) at one point or another. Shit man I went through this exact same thing 10 year ago however both of us were young and dumb and were together, fucked around, got back together, etc. Truth be told, if she is indeed your best friend you will never get over this and I do not mean that in a shitty or negative way--- the &quot;best friend&quot; to &quot;girlfriend&quot; line is a bitch to cross. Relationships are hard as fuck, especially in this day and age. We all want things to work and for a variety or reasons they do not. However I learned to take it as a learning experience and just move on with my life- eventually you will meet someone else and things will just click. <br /><br />Personally during that time I stayed sober and I think that may be the best thing for you. If you are depressed about the whole thing which it sounds there is no need to throw fuel on the fire, just let this life lesson run it&#039;s course and be on the lookout bro. Pain itself can be a drug, at least it was for me.&nbsp; Because of all the time you&#039;ve spent confiding in this person, you may have missed some opportunities and who knows- the person you are looking for may be right in front of you. <br /><br />Cheer up pimpin. It will get better.

				yeah, it sucks but you will get over it eventually.&nbsp; if your like me it may take years. But you WILL get over it and find someone new. And then the new person will most likely fuck you over eventually as well.&nbsp; So the question you really need to ask yourself is; do you want to put yourself in that situation again?&nbsp;

				Some of the best advice I&#039;ve received regarding heartbreak to is fully-experience it as it is. All drugs on some level will tend to skew your mind away from natural reality. Get some exercise and let your natural chemicals balance out your emotions!<br /><br />Once you&#039;re over him/her... then light one up and enjoy your new found freedom!!&nbsp; ;D

				You&#039;ll get over it eventually but what you need to experience is life, not any drug. Go out and continue living your life and you&#039;ll forget and move on hopefully from it and become a better person. Or you could dwell on it and let your jealously grow until the only thing you can do is kill the and everyone involved.

				Thanks for all of the suggestions- it is always nice having multiple perspectives on an issue.<br /><br />On a side note I took methylone and 4-mec yesterday, and the experience felt very pleasurable to my mind and body.&nbsp; I felt more in touch with the emotions I held and could communicate them very well.&nbsp;

				I would recommend going out with a new ladyfriend (not necessarily a romantic interest but just a female friend) who you trust, take some LSD and MDMA together (candyflip) and bring benzos along for the comedown.&nbsp; Go somewhere fun like a theme park or a zoo and listen to music together whilst tripping outdoors on a nice day, smoke joints outdoors and have some beers, discuss and philosophize about life.&nbsp; I&#039;ve done this after breakups and I don&#039;t really have any regrets in life despite having loved and lost in the past.<br /><br />Am currently happily in a relationship that&#039;s soon lasted a year (long time for me) so I&#039;m lucky not to be in your shoes, but the above suggestion would be my recommendation.&nbsp; Just keep it cool and in moderation, know your brain&#039;s limits before candyflipping hardcore at 6 flags with a chick or whatever LOL.&nbsp; It won&#039;t be a great experience for getting over a break up if you wind up being beaten by rent-a-cops and arrested for public intoxication.

				Using a drug to get over an emotional crisis is most likely going to cause you to build a dependance.<br />I would never suggest this.

				Im starting to think DMT may be the answer I&#039;m gonna try it to break this hump cause the xtc thing has failed horribly (unless im on it, then i feel like a little kid and have a fucking blast)- but I remember I first tried DMT after a buddy of mine passed away and i remember feeling very at peace with the world and relaxed after that, also at the time I had a kick ass relationship and was in a more stable environment than now&nbsp; and then again a lot has happened since then and i never had problems with psycedelics before whereas now I can&#039;t touch shrooms or lsd- it would be too intense<br /><br />any advice on DMT with shit situations

				@ianfleming<br /><br />I hear ya, I started a new years revolution for mj, and had not smoked the herbal medication up until a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Previously I was smoking an ounce a month and was pretty addicted and have learned a lot of about my relationship to drugs these last few months.&nbsp; Being sober for that long gives you perspective on the stoned state and why you seek it.&nbsp; I suggest it to anyone not because I think it&#039;s healthy to take a break every once in a while, but it is a chance to get to know your mind and impulses on a deeper level.

				try doing some MXE.&nbsp; helped me out quite a bit....&nbsp; if Everything happens for a reason, maybe you deserve someone better and will find someone who is more caring.&nbsp; I would also recommend reading a book called &quot;Against Love&quot; by Laura Kipnis. Will make you look at love and relationships in a new and therapeutic light.&nbsp; &nbsp;After you start reading this book you&#039;ll begin to realize how much value western society puts on those stereotypical &quot;movie&quot; romances that don&#039;t really exist in the real world.&nbsp; And may even turn you off to future relationships.&nbsp; Relationships take a lot of work for them to succeed.
