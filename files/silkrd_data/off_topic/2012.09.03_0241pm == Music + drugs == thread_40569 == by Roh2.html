				I&#039;ve always loved music to the bottom of my heart and I listen to music almost 24/7. I cant sleep without listening to something because I&#039;ve been listening music every night since I got my first mp3 player when I was 9.<br /><br /># Weed: Music is amplified and you can really hear things that you wouldn&#039;t normally hear or notice. Weed is a great for listening to music.<br /># LSD: Makes music something that fits the moment (almost every time). Different layers can be heard. Great if you like music!<br /># Ecstasy: The good feeling that E gives you amplifies music, but doesn&#039;t really make it any better/bigger. &#039;&#039;Raves&#039;&#039; (you know what I mean) though are the best thing on E.<br /># DXM: This is the 1. at the moment for me. Music euphoria is something I couldn&#039;t even imagine. Music is perfect, music is euphoria.<br /># Opioids: I don&#039;t have much experience with these, but what I learned is that music is basically the same as on E; its not really amplified, but the high gives it a little extra boost.<br /><br />I&#039;m not professional with any of these substances, but I&#039;ve used them enough to experiment with listening to music to know some of the effects they have on it.<br />I don&#039;t play any instrument.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to hear your opinion on these and hopefully add your own 1. drug for music listening, helping me with my guest.

				First time I heard about DXM will do my research!&nbsp; I consider my self quite a pro with LSD (and is my favourite one) and quite a bit on weed. Agreed on your observations on these. I would just add that LSD simply takes the musical experience to unimaginable heights and weed doesn&#039;t even come close. It feels kind of like you are God choosing that particular music at that particular moment and nothing else in the world matters. It takes you to places outside of your self and when every track finishes you fly back briefly to earth before take off again. I was always a big music fan and I literally was reborn the moment I tried LSD. If anyone considers himself an audiophile he owes it to himself to try LSD.
