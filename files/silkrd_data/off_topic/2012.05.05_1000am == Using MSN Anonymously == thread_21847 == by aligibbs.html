				Apologies if this should be in &#039;Security,&#039; it doesn&#039;t fully pertain to to SR.<br /><br />I wondered if anyone knew if you can chat on MSN anonymously? I&#039;ve not used it since, er, the 90s but for some reason it seems to be growing in popularity amongst my colleagues and friends (does anyone know why? Even just installing it I don&#039;t like it and I haven&#039;t even used it properly yet).<br /><br />I&#039;ve always assumed that IMs sent over MSN (and most other chat clients) could be intercepted and read, as there&#039;s not always encryption. I&#039;ve used pidgin&#039;s encryption/privacy features. Does anyone rate these? I have never used any of their security features on a hotmail account. Do they work?<br /><br />Also, does anyone know if it&#039;s dangerous to have MSN loaded while using SR/Tor? <br /><br />Thanks guys.

				Use pidgin, use OTR it uses DH and AES and has probably been audited by at least a few cryptographers, it is probably secure if you use it right. Make sure to use authentication or else you are weak as shit to MITM attacks. You can and should have pidgin route through Tor, and no it isn&#039;t a risk to use pidgin and SR at the same time.

It&#039;s some jackass, big wig consultant at my work that they&#039;ve had come in for a bit and he&#039;s insisting on us using MSN (it&#039;s taken a good month for him to let me run it through pidgin and not bloody Windows Live Messenger [this thing is horrific, it feels like someone took a Microsoft shaped shit all over my laptop! :( )<br /><br />Ahh, how I wish I was a teenager :) Unfortunately, I&#039;m a little older. In the interest of anonymity I&#039;ll provide a rough age range - older than 26 but younger than 42 =)<br /><br />Although, perhaps the other poster is correct, maybe it is a European thing. What do others use (out of interest)?<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Use pidgin, use OTR it uses DH and AES and has probably been audited by at least a few cryptographers, it is probably secure if you use it right.

I didn&#039;t know you could route pidgin through Tor - to do this do I have to have the TBB installed? I currently use Liberte to access SR, do you happen to know if Liberte auto-routes pidgin traffic through Tor? Cheers dude!
