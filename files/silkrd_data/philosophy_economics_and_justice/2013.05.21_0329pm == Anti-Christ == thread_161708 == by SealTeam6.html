				Well if you read the sign I am sure you recognized that some of those sign have all ready have taken please. Sorry I cannot really answer you question but here is something more about the Anti Christ.<br />This is what have been write about the Anti Christ by Muslim scholars. Plus some extra about what have closer the the day of Judgement<br /><br />There follows a brief description from the Qur’aan and Saheeh Sunnah narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about these three major signs that will precede the Hour and will come at the end of time just before the Day of Resurrection.<br /><br />The Dajjaal – a man created by Allaah, who will appear at the end of time because of something that makes Allaah angry. He will spread corruption on earth and will claim divinity, calling on people to worship him. They will be tested by the extraordinary powers that Allaah will grant him, such as causing rain to fall, reviving the earth with vegetation and extracting the treasures of the earth. He will be a young man with a ruddy complexion, short of stature, with curly hair. He will be one-eyed; his right eye will be flat and his other eye will have a thick piece of flesh over it. Written between his eyes will be the word “Kaafir” (disbeliever). Most of those who follow him will be Jews. He will meet his end at the hands of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) who will kill him with a spear in Lod, which is in Palestine.<br /><br />Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj – two disbelieving tribes from among the sons of Adam. They have wide faces and small eyes. They used to spread mischief on earth, so Allaah gave Dhoo’l-Qarnayn the power to build a barrier to detain them. They will keep on digging at it until Allaah gives them permission to come out at the end of time, after ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) has killed the Dajjaal. They will emerge in huge numbers and will drink up the lake of Tiberias (in Palestine). They will spread mischief on earth and no one will be able to resist them. ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and the believers with him will take refuge in Mount Toor until Allaah destroys Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj by sending worms that will eat their necks. Then Allaah will send rain to wash away their bodies into the sea and cleanse the earth of their stench.<br /><br />Al-Daabah – a great creature which Allaah will cause to emerge when the people become corrupt. It will speak to mankind and exhort them, having the ability to reason and speak. It will make marks on the people’s noses which will distinguish the believers from the disbelievers.<br /><br />(For more informations, see Ashraat al-Saa’ah by Yoosuf al-Waabil or al-Qiyaamah al-Kubra by ‘Umar al-Ashqar).<br /><br />The responsibility of the Muslim is to believe in what was narrated from Allaah and His Messenger. How many wondrous and strange things has Allaah created in this world, which speak of His might and power, may He be glorified and exalted.

				I see the signs all the time, but sometimes I wonder if this holy war between the two forces has not happened already, or has happened quietly without any man knowing.&nbsp; What if the day of judgement has been misrepresented or what if God has decided to change his mind and not bring the world to an end in the manner that has been written.&nbsp; Could you except this as a possibility?

				God the Creator must be perfect if He would not be perfect He would not be God. And he is separate from His creation. <br />He is perfect in all his attributes.<br />The universe began with a big bang and every thing that has a begin must have an end. That is simple logic.<br />God the Creator must be Ever-Lasting.<br />He is the most fair and He gave us free will as a test. So ever evil that is on this earth is form out on action. <br />He does not wrong any one but we wrong our selves.<br />Like in Chapter 112 verse of the Quran<br />And there is none comparable unto Him.<br />We cannot see Him but He sees us. And has decide in his wisdom to inform us about Himself by means of revelation, messenger and prophets.<br /><br />God is with us with His knowledge. There is a verse in the Quran that says this. Chapter 50 verse 16<br />NOW, VERILY, it is We who have created man, and We know what his innermost self whispers within him: for We are closer to him than his jugular vein.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is none comparable unto Him.<br />So God is not like us. The Christian says that God created us in his own image. The Muslim do not confirm or deny some thing that the Christians says. <br />We have hands right and left. God has two right hands. But we can not know how the look like. <br />And there is none comparable unto Him.<br />He does not need to come down to the earth. If there is something He wants done. He says be and it is.<br />There are verse in the Quran. When you read them the devil run away. Then the Islamic call the prayer is given the devil run. If you say bismillah (in the name of Allah) the devil becomes as small as fly. So he gave us human knowledge and weapons the fight the devils amongst to men and the djinn&#039;s <br /><br />

				The world is perfect look around you. Do you see any rift in the sky. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hath created seven heavens in harmony. Thou (Muhammad) canst see no fault in the Beneficent One&#039;s creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, turn thy vision [upon it] again and yet again: [and every time] thy vision will fall back upon thee, dazzled and truly defeated.... (Sc., in its endeavour to encompass the mysteries of the universe.)<br /><br />If you ever played computer games I assume you did. Then you know some games are buggy and you have glitches and sometimes you walk trough walls get stuck in a corner or something like that. Did that ever happen to you.<br /><br />The creation of this world is perfect. But because of our free will. We make mistakes because we are not All-Knowing. We are not God.<br />The perfect God can create any thing. Dont blame him for the faults of the people. <br />God there Creator must be perfect. And as me people are not perfect we are not worth worship.

				Ahh the age old question.. first of all I&#039;m not a big fan of religion because it is based on scripts that even with the best intentions of people cannot be accurate. Imagine if something happens today and 3 people describe it. Even if it was the same event, you will see that the 3 stories are different based on the perspective of the person describing it. Now add the fact that thousands of years pass from the important writings, it doesn&#039;t seem very plausible to me that what I&#039;m reading say in the Bible at God knows what revision, is any more accurate. <br /><br />Personal opinion (a bit of Lucy helped me forming it) is that we are all Gods i.e. God is the ocean and we are a drop of it. We simply color that drop according to the lives we live and it can be more Christ like or more non-Christ. So yes maybe we could describe our current times as quite negative, or closer to the age of &quot;anti-Christ&quot; but from my perspective this simply describes humanity as a collective. <br /><br />Don&#039;t forget Christ was also born human. So was Gandhi, Mother Teresa, John Lennon and so on. They all possess the attribute of very clear love for humanity. It&#039;s just that each religion focuses on one example - Christianity on Christ. Similarly there were people that acted from a very non-loving place such as Hitler. With the same logic of Christianity, he could easily be described as THE anti-Christ 1000 years from now, or alternatively as just a person being close to the concept. It&#039;s all on the perspective, i.e. describing the truth from slightly different angles. <br /><br />Personally I&#039;m not worried about the &quot;coming of the Anti-Christ&quot; as we all learn it and supposedly prophesized. I believe that is just a story to keep people going in circles, i.e. expecting a future outside event instead of getting off their asses and take control of their own lives. I believe it is a concept devised by our same much loved elite ruling our world with the purpose of mentally taking the power away from people and placing it in some magical land outside our selves. i.e. there is nothing I can do, since it has been predicted that the anti-Christ will come. And this is another example of how still in 2013 we are a largely manipulated race, not in control of our lives and living very much like sheep. <br /><br />

				I am the Anti-Christ.<br />I am also God. And so are you.<br />Spiritual entities are mere cowls that the unconscious mind wears to present itself before the conscious mind. Objectively, there are no gods or devils. Subjectively, they all exist somewhere. It doesn&#039;t get any simpler than that.
