				So many stats have decrimnalized possession of marijuana while others have made it legal for medical use and 2 have made it completly legal for recreational use. So my question is now that they many states have used this loophole top relax marijuana laws is it time to legalize other psychedelics for medical use?

				Its my belief they all drugs should be legal. With that in mind the focus should be on taxing it and using the money towards drug education programs as well as reabilitation programs. People are going to get whatever they want anyway. The difference is you deflate the underground market and put the money back into programs that help people.

				It&#039;s high time to just legalize every drug like Portugal did and spend all that prosecution and incarceration money on helping out addicts that are willing to ask for the help they need. If I&#039;m not mistaken Ketamine already has accepted and legal medical uses for treating depression. Your main problem with getting all these things legalized is all the people who profit off of it being illegal.

				Perhaps its also a matter of how you deal with it. <br /><br />In most western European countries possessing illicit drugs is a crime, but if the amounts are such that they could be considered to be for personal use only, people rarely face prison time. In some countries they are fined, in other they drugs are confiscated and no further problem follows. <br /><br />Sliding the scale like that may not seem ideologically correct, but it does have its practical consequences. At some point people will begin asking why possession is de facto legal, while selling is not. As soon as the end users have nothing to fear from the legal system, the supply chain is likely to follow.

				In a true democracy, people can do whatever they like as long as they don&#039;t harm others or take their rights away. All drugs should be either decriminalised or legalised and regulated.<br />There is absolutely no reason to make drugs illegal and punish drug users and sellers. Most drug users are casual drug users and fit in with the rest of society and harm nobody except perhaps themselves. As adults, we should have the right to make decisions to what we put in out body. It makes no sense that I can legally consume 1 litre of spirits every day, but if I choose to use MDMA, LSD, Cocaine, amphetamine or marijuana every now and then, I am treated as a criminal. Criminalising drugs only adds to their harm potential because drug users are uneducated and have no idea what the purity of their drugs are or if their pills contain PMA, etc. Expert scientific and medical research has shown that cannabis, MDMA &amp; LSD are all less harmful and less addictive than tobacco and alcohol. <br /><br />It&#039;s about time all drugs are legalised and regulated. Drugs are very easy to obtain as it is. Countries that have decriminalised drugs have shown the number of drug users to remain steady of even decline and HIV and other disease rates attributed to drug use have dropped sharply. Governments around the world need to legalise, regulate and tax all drugs. The products we buy would be a certain and known purity. The money raised from taxes could fund education and harm reduction. At the moment the Government is losing billions of dollars every year by keeping drugs illegal and drug users are dying because of inconsistent drug quality.<br /><br />I hope that now that marijuana is fully legal for anybody of age in 2 states of the United States, other States and other countries will follow. There is no reason why drug users need to fear about being caught with drugs. It is unfair to target drug users and punish us as criminals simply because we use something the Governments around the world have decided should be banned!

But fuck the economy. It&#039;s not as important as reducing harm and getting drug users out of jail!<br />I think the economy would be far better off though. Prisons cost massive amounts of money and a huge majority of people in prison are in there for drug related offences.<br /><br />I live in Australia, where the Government apparently promotes harm reduction, but that is a load of crap.<br />There is often sniffer dogs than enter clubs and catch loads of people with a couple of pills, bit of speed, etc.<br />Here, posession of a drug is usually just a large fine ($500+) and therefore I think it is just another form of revenue raising.<br /><br />Outside music festivals, there are always sniffer dogs. But honestly, they do more harm than good. People panic when they see the sniffer dogs and consume all their drugs at once and then an hour or so later they are fucked off their faces. <br /><br />Even if they aren&#039;t legalised, I would like to see pill testing available at nightlife hotspots, clubs, etc. In a major city in Australia a few months ago 5 people died from a bad batch of pills in one night. The police knew several weeks earlier that there was a bad batch and alot of people were overdosing. But they refused to publicise it, and that resulted in the deaths, which infuriates me. Five peoples lives could have been saved if pill testing was available or if the bad batch was announced publicly. The pills reportedly contained PMA, not MDMA.<br /><br />And yes, it would certainly reduce the amount of young people using drugs. I know in high school it was easier to get weed (and cheaper) than alcohol.

People should definitely not be criminalised and even imprisoned because they use or distribute drugs. It&#039;s the same as any other product or business. A seller sells a product in exchange for currency. If tobacco is legal, there is no way in hell MDMA, LSD, amphetamine or marijuana should be illegal!<br /><br />And sadly, as much as I&#039;d love for pharmaceutical companies to be able to use MDMA for theraputic use, I doubt it will happen in the next 20 years.<br />The Government has so strongly enforced the message &quot;drugs are bad. You will die,&quot; that a vast majority of people actually believe it. Any move to legalise it would be very quickly knocked down by anti-drug groups. All they are achieving is taking away other people&#039;s rights and contributing to organised crime groups and taking potential tax revenue from the Government. Meanwhile, drugs are everywhere and with every seizure and arrest made, not even a dent is made in supply.

				The most important thing to consider here is that government policy is -NOT- based on science, at all. <br /><br />Traditionally, most countries allow the legal production, sale and use of alcohol and tobacco. <br /><br />Scientifically, they would classify on the end of being very addictive and destructive compared to other drugs available. There is no ration reason to assume that smoking a joint would be more harmful than drinking a beer and/or having a cigarette. This is common knowledge, i doubt you&#039;ll find any independent scientist to tell you otherwise. <br /><br />The problem is that we don&#039;t look at these things with a scientific perspective at all: people consider things like alcohol and nicotine as god-given substances to use, whereas all others should be illegal. I&#039;m quite sure that the amount of harm would be reduced if you could get a population to switch from alcohol and tobacco to using cannabis and lsd instead. Doing so may be politically impossible for now, but that doesn&#039;t bunk the science behind it.

After legalization I would modify the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms to be the bureau of drugs and firearms. They’re current budget is roughly $1.2 billion. Let’s say for arguments sake that all the new drugs caused their budget to skyrocket 1,500% what it was, that still would leave you saving roughly $46 billion. <br />Inspired by Obama’s move for stricter background checks for firearms purchases, there would be licensed sellers of drugs and firearms. Similar to a liquor store, you must show valid ID proving you are 18 (because if you are an adult in charge of your own decision and can be drafted why can’t you drink?). Where this differs to a liquor store is that they would swipe your ID and it would bring up your background which would consist of essentially two things: whether you have been convicted of a violent crime and your mental health record. If you are deemed by a licensed doctor not suitable for recreational drugs or firearms use,&nbsp; or are convicted of a violent crime it would be shown to the clerk in a yes/no way, or more likely red/green. This way your privacy is kept. If you are denied access to drugs or guns, you may appeal this in their own courts, and they will decide whether to reinstate this right. <br />I do whole-heartedly agree that addictive drugs such as heroin, cocaine (not the coca leaf), methamphetamine, and even alcohol &amp; cigarettes are major public health problems, but even they should be sold in the shops, because there is no other way to keep the money out of the hand of the violent cartels and gangs. This is where you need to take a portion of that $46 billion left and spend it on HONEST education about the use of these drugs and their ill side effects. I would have a big smile on my face the day the legal maker of heroin or meth or coke goes bankrupt due to lack of demand. That is how you wage a war on DRUGS instead of our current war on DRUG USERS.

				Drugs should be legalized but this will never happen because the government would have to admit that they are wrong. Prescription ketamine should be used for depression and MDMA for PTSD especially with all of the war veterans coming home completely shell-shocked.
