				If Heaven and Hell were real, physical places, full of their own societies, laws and order, philosophies and ideals, what do you think they would be?<br /><br />For me, I&#039;ve always considered Heaven to be a pseudosocialist totalitarian dictatorship run by the most corrupt an evil alien known to Man.<br /><br />In opposition to Heaven, Hell is a Libertarian wasteland, a giant desert that started out as a penal colony, cast off from Heaven, but ended up transforming into a beautiful oasis. Hell is a scary looking place at first, with scary-looking beings and creatures, violent volcanos and random dust storms or even blizzards at random.<br /><br />While Heaven is seemingly just and perfect, it&#039;s a thin veneer over horrifying injustice, inequality, oppression and corruption, masquerading as a socialist paradise.<br /><br />Hell, in contrast, is a very brutally honest society, with no real government per se, though some landowners protect their homes, and are constantly engaging in minor scuffles and skirmishes with each other. Hell is very fond of drugs, guns, prostitutes, extremely perverted or strange lifestyles, but as a general rule, Hell tends to value family cohesion, solidarity among neighbors, a strong community identity and economy, money and trade, keeping your promises and word, honor and justice, and military might and glory.<br /><br />As you might imagine, Heaven and Hell REALLY hate each other.<br /><br />Satan is more of a figurehead, having no real power, though he&#039;s go a REALLY fancy mediterranean revival style home with a kinky dungeon and a huge harem of horny insatiable sluts.<br /><br />However, various homesteads within the Separatist Freestate of Hell have a very loose confederacy in order to combat the constant invasions and assaults and infiltrations of the People&#039;s Socialist Republic of Heaven&#039;s agents and military, so they are not defenseless. They actually have really good automated defense systems, drones and unmanned aircraft and spacecraft, specializing in robotics and remote-controlled military defenses to minimize losses of their limited population. Not many of Hell&#039;s citizens are actually capable of reproducing. Most have been cursed with barren immortality.<br /><br />In contrast, The People&#039;s Socialist Republic of Heaven prefers &quot;Traditional&quot; battlecraft, relying upon sheer numbers of unskilled laborers, mandatory conscription and mandatory lifetime military service of all children after the firstborn, and contraception and birth control usage is punishable by virtual reality-based torture for the rest of their immortal lives.<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />If Heaven and Hell were countries or nations, what would they be like?
