				I&#039;m afraid of the police. I&#039;m scared of getting locked up in a jail cell, away from my friends and family. I&#039;m afraid of overzealous officers abusing their power and being physical with me (its happened to me before). <br /><br />I choose to disobey unjust laws, and I&#039;m afraid of &quot;the man&quot; wanting to punish me for it.<br /><br />Fuck the police!

				I&#039;m not afraid of much. (not trying to be a tough guy here)<br /><br />After I had accepted, what I thought was, death during a psychedelic experience, it really changed me. I am not afraid of death and I feel not being afraid of death removed almost all of my fears.<br /><br />I guess what I am afraid of is losing loved ones. That&#039;s about the only thing I can think of.<br /><br />Sure if you catch me face to face with a grizzly I might shit my pants, but show me somebody who wont lol<br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere

				Afraid of many things when in a drug induced psychosis... people breaking into your house thru the roof, stealing money from you, following you in a car is a good one, family calling the cops on you...haven&#039;t had one in years just&nbsp; amazing the regenerative powers&nbsp; of the brain when given the opportunity to heal.<br /><br />In reality sometimes of death...&quot; the thought of death is worse than death itself&quot;

				Thought about this one for a long time too. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m much afraid of physical things, though if I were faced with an actual life-or-death situation, I&#039;m sure I&#039;d have a normal response. The day in and day out fears that get me are silly: money problems (I&#039;ve always had enough even though we&#039;ve been desperately poor for much of our lives), and interpersonal relations. I want people to like me and I fear rejection and non-acceptance, even in something like this anonymous forum!

				I´m afraid of having it &quot;too good&quot;. <br /><br />I&#039;m the kinda person, that when everything is going my way and I have allot of success, I get too full of myself.
