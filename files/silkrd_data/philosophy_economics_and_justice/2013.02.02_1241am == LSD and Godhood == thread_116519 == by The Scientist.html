				A funny thing happens with LSD, and people often misinterpret it. You&#039;ll&nbsp; discover that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary behavior&nbsp; disappears. You will realize that what you describe as things under your own will feel exactly&nbsp; the same as things going on outside you. You watch other people moving, and you know you&#039;re&nbsp; doing that, just like you&#039;re breathing or circulating your blood. And if you don&#039;t understand&nbsp; what&#039;s going on, you&#039;re liable to get crazy at this point, and to feel that you are God in the&nbsp; Jehovah sense. To say that you actually have power over other people, so that you can alter what&nbsp; you&#039;re doing. And that you&#039;re omnipotent in a very crude, literal kind of Bible sense. You see?&nbsp; A lot of people feel that and they go crazy. They put them away. They think they&#039;re Jesus Christ&nbsp; and that everybody ought to fall down and worship them. That&#039;s only they got their wires&nbsp; crossed. This experience happened to them, but they don&#039;t know how to interpret it. So be&nbsp; careful of that. Jung calls it inflation. People who get the Holy Man syndrome, that I suddenly&nbsp; discover that I am the lord and that I am above good and evil and so on, and therefore I start&nbsp; giving myself airs and graces. But the point is, everybody else is, too. If you discover that&nbsp; you are that, then you ought to know that everybody else is. Alan Watts.

				I should probably contribute to this line of thinking.<br /><br />One day, I had a psychotic break, and people were slightly confused by it because I had a very nuanced version of the Holy Man Syndrome.<br /><br />The distinction was that I acknowledged that everyone else was interconnected at the same level as I was, and that I have very limited influence over what I could perceive.<br /><br />In my mind&#039;s eye, I could see how everything was interconnected, and I could see in real time how my tiniest actions affected the world. It was extremely overwhelming.<br /><br />It felt as though I could predict what happened, I&#039;d know it would ring before phone calls came, and I&#039;d know who it was before the caller ID signal finally came through.<br /><br />Everyone&#039;s inner voices seemed to be audible to me, and I could not easily distinguish between thought and physical voice.<br /><br />At the time, I didn&#039;t realize that the voices were not auditory, so I assumed I could broadcast, but not receive. I did not believe there was mind control being placed in my underwear or something foolish like that, however, I was suddenly aware of a vast network of psychics. Now that I&#039;m outside of that psychotic break, I can reasonably assume that this whole psychic thing is probably not true, however, within the delusion, I could sense that although many people held up a role as a facade, there were many times when their true selves exposed themselves, and it came across as tiny instances of weirdness normally.<br /><br />During that time, I could sense that all psychics were actually linked in some unknown way, but that they all influenced each other, and I also noticed something else strange. People whose minds are extremely weak, but who have some psychic talent, would act out emotionally charged scenes of other people with greater psychic talent but no voluntary control over it. I was completely psychotic for a long time, so my mind ran along this thread for some time.<br /><br />Maybe I should write a novel on psychic warfare?<br /><br />Random question for those better read than I am: Is there a story somewhere about the ability to create voluntary time loops in an organized way?<br /><br />Say you were aware that time loops existed, and also aware that in some distant time in the future, time travel and time manipulation would not only be possible but extremely common? What then?<br /><br />I wonder if there would be some way I could study the topic as a theoretical physicist? Oh well.<br /><br />I hope that helps.

				seem like we are on the same page somewhat.. I think of&nbsp; bliss -&#039;among other things&#039; as me seeing the networks which make up this reality, and being completely immersed in it...&nbsp; not just simply euphoric estaticism, we can get the laymen&#039;s euphoric bliss on high doses of mdma.&nbsp; Bliss is the point of death when you don&#039;t have to worry about ANYTHING too.&nbsp; <br /><br />to go further.. on one of my high dose lsd trip, i seen the hologram or grid of earth/human consciousness as a network of spinning orbed grids which composed the above ceiling and room i was in, they all connected to each other by visible or invisible electricity.&nbsp; That trip showed me that my thoughts controlled the way the orb&#039;s in my reference point would spin, and that essentially caused an effect on the other orbs.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I have had a few negative mystical experiences back in my 500+ mic days, full blown psych ward lsd ego death trips.. but i learned from them, and i am glad i went that far...&nbsp; That shit was horror tho, hell and back.&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty introverted so for me to loose myself was an experience which was good for me, in a way.

				ello scientist! long time no see&nbsp; :D<br /><br />i have been listening to ram dass a lot lately and he talks specifically about this subject, in a way that will blow your mind.<br /><br />its extremely interesting, i beg you to give this a read. <br />&quot;maharajji&quot; is a guru he met in india<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;In 1967 when I first came to India, I brought with me a supply of LSD, hoping to find someone who might understand more about these substances than we did in the West. When I had met Maharajji (Neem Karoli Baba), after some days the thought had crossed my mind that he would be a perfect person to ask. <br /><br />The next day after having that thought, I was called to him and he asked me immediately, &quot;Do you have a question?&quot;<br />Of course, being before him was such a powerful experience that I had completely forgotten the question I had had in my mind the night before. So I looked stupid and said, &quot;No, Maharajji, I have no question.&quot;<br />He appeared irritated and said, &quot;Where is the medicine?&quot;<br />I was confused but Bhagavan Dass suggested,<br />&quot;Maybe he means the LSD.&quot; I asked and Maharajji nodded. The bottle of LSD was in the car and I was sent to fetch it. <br /><br />When I returned I emptied the vial of pills into my hand. In addition to the LSD there were a number of other pills for this and that--diarrhea, fever, a sleeping pill, and so forth. He asked about each of these. He asked if they gave powers. I didn&#039;t understand at the time and thought that by &quot;powers&quot; perhaps he meant physical strength. I said, &quot;No.&quot; Later, of course, I came to understand that the word he had used, &quot;siddhis,&quot; means psychic powers. <br /><br />Then he held out his hand for the LSD. I put one pill on his palm.<br />Each of these pills was about three hundred micrograms of very pure LSD-<br />-a solid dose for an adult. He beckoned for more, so I put a second pill in his hand--six hundred micrograms. Again he beckoned and I added yet another, making the total dosage 900 micrograms--certainly not a dose for beginners. Then he threw all the pills into his mouth. My reaction was one of shock mixed with fascination of a social scientist eager to see what would happen. He allowed me to stay for an hour--and nothing happened.<br /><br />Nothing whatsover. <br />He just laughed at me.<br /><br />The whole thing had happened very fast and unexpectedly. When I returned to the United States in 1968 I told many people about this acid feat. But there had remained in me a gnawing doubt that perhaps he had been putting me on and had thrown the pills over his shoulder or palmed them, because I hadn&#039;t actually seen them go into his mouth and had thrown the pills over his shoulder or palmed them, because I hadn&#039;t actually seen them go into his mouth.<br /><br />Three years later, when I was back in India, <br />he asked me one day, &quot;Did you give me medicine when you were in India last time?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />&quot;Did I take it?&quot; he asked. ( Ah, there was my doubt made manifest!)<br />&quot;I think you did.&quot;<br />&quot;What happened?<br />&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />&quot;Oh! Jao!&quot; and he sent me off for the evening.<br /><br />The next morning I was called over to the porch in front of his room, where he sat in the mornings on a tucket. He asked, &quot;Have you got any more of that medicine?&quot;<br />It just so happened that I was carrying a small supply of LSD for &quot;just in case,&quot; and this was obviously it. &quot;Yes.&quot; - &quot;Get it,&quot; he said. So I did. In the bottle were five pills of three hundred micrograms each. One of the pills was broken. I placed them on my palm and held them out to him. He took the four unbroken pills. Then, one by one, very obviously and very deliberately, he placed each one in his mouth and swallowed it-- another unspoken thought of mine now answered.<br />As soon as he had swallowed the last one, he asked, &quot;Can I take water?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />&quot;Hot or cold?&quot;<br />&quot;It doesn&#039;t matter.&quot;<br />He started yelling for water and drank a cup when it was brought.<br />The he asked,&quot; How long will it take to act?&quot;<br />&quot;Anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour.&quot;<br />He called for an older man, a long -time devotee who had a watch,<br />and Maharajji held the man&#039;s wrist, often pulling it up to him to peer at the watch.<br />Then he asked,&quot;Will it make me crazy?&quot;<br />That seemed so bizzare to me that I could only go along with what seemed to be a gag.<br />So I said, &quot;Probably.&quot; And then we waited. <br /><br />After some time he pulled the blanket over his face, and when he came out after a moment his eyes were rolling and his mouth was ajar and he looked totally mad. I got upset. What was happening? <br />Had I misjudged his powers? After all, he was an old man (though how old I had no idea), and I had let him take twelve hundred micrograms. Maybe last time he had thrown them away and then he read my mind and was trying to prove to me he could do it, not realizing how strong the &quot;medicine&quot; really was. <br /><br />Guilt and anxiety poured through me. But when I looked at him again he was perfectly normal and looking at the watch. At the end of an hour it was obvious nothing had happened. His reactions had been a total put-on. And then he asked,<br />&quot;Have you got anything stronger?&quot; I didn&#039;t. Then he said, &quot;These medicines were used in Kulu Valley long ago. But yogis have lost that knowledge. They were used with fasting. Nobody knows now. To take them with no effect, your mind must be firmly fixed on God. Others would would be afraid to take. Many saints would not take this.&quot; And he left it at that.<br />*******<br />When I asked him if I should take LSD again, he said,<br />&quot;It should not be taken in a hot climate. If you are in a place that is cool and peaceful, and you are alone and your mind is turned toward God, then you may take the yogi medicine.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

But there had remained in me a gnawing doubt that perhaps he had been putting me on and had thrown the pills over his shoulder or palmed them, because I hadn&#039;t actually seen them go into his mouth and had thrown the pills over his shoulder or palmed them, because I hadn&#039;t actually seen them go into his mouth.<br /><br />Three years later, when I was back in India, <br />he asked me one day, &quot;Did you give me medicine when you were in India last time?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />&quot;Did I take it?&quot; he asked. ( Ah, there was my doubt made manifest!)<br />&quot;I think you did.&quot;<br />&quot;What happened?<br />&quot;Nothing.&quot;<br />&quot;Oh! Jao!&quot; and he sent me off for the evening.<br /><br />The next morning I was called over to the porch in front of his room, where he sat in the mornings on a tucket. He asked, &quot;Have you got any more of that medicine?&quot;<br />It just so happened that I was carrying a small supply of LSD for &quot;just in case,&quot; and this was obviously it. &quot;Yes.&quot; - &quot;Get it,&quot; he said. So I did. In the bottle were five pills of three hundred micrograms each. One of the pills was broken. I placed them on my palm and held them out to him. He took the four unbroken pills. Then, one by one, very obviously and very deliberately, he placed each one in his mouth and swallowed it-- another unspoken thought of mine now answered.<br />As soon as he had swallowed the last one, he asked, &quot;Can I take water?&quot;<br />&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />&quot;Hot or cold?&quot;<br />&quot;It doesn&#039;t matter.&quot;<br />He started yelling for water and drank a cup when it was brought.<br />The he asked,&quot; How long will it take to act?&quot;<br />&quot;Anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour.&quot;<br />He called for an older man, a long -time devotee who had a watch,<br />and Maharajji held the man&#039;s wrist, often pulling it up to him to peer at the watch.<br />Then he asked,&quot;Will it make me crazy?&quot;<br />That seemed so bizzare to me that I could only go along with what seemed to be a gag.<br />So I said, &quot;Probably.&quot; And then we waited. <br /><br />After some time he pulled the blanket over his face, and when he came out after a moment his eyes were rolling and his mouth was ajar and he looked totally mad. I got upset. What was happening? <br />Had I misjudged his powers? After all, he was an old man (though how old I had no idea), and I had let him take twelve hundred micrograms. Maybe last time he had thrown them away and then he read my mind and was trying to prove to me he could do it, not realizing how strong the &quot;medicine&quot; really was. <br /><br />Guilt and anxiety poured through me. But when I looked at him again he was perfectly normal and looking at the watch. At the end of an hour it was obvious nothing had happened. His reactions had been a total put-on. And then he asked,<br />&quot;Have you got anything stronger?&quot; I didn&#039;t. Then he said, &quot;These medicines were used in Kulu Valley long ago. But yogis have lost that knowledge. They were used with fasting. Nobody knows now. To take them with no effect, your mind must be firmly fixed on God. Others would would be afraid to take. Many saints would not take this.&quot; And he left it at that.<br />*******<br />When I asked him if I should take LSD again, he said,<br />&quot;It should not be taken in a hot climate. If you are in a place that is cool and peaceful, and you are alone and your mind is turned toward God, then you may take the yogi medicine.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>beautiful! i have heard about this, though not in detail. ram dass is incredible. be here now is essential reading for any aspiring psychonaut. :)

				Very interesting read. I once had a similar revelation. I was staring into the heavens and stars on 400mcg of LSD and I could swear the universe and stars and life and beings of my world and others were all part of a collective consciousness. Was this super entity a AI computer? Was this godly presence just a collective of our memories thus being everywhere and nowhere he receives all of our organic data and this knows everything?

				You guys are on a whole other level, and I&#039;ve kind of been on the fence about LSD, I&#039;ve been sticking pretty hard to opiates, and weed, and a little coke now and then.&nbsp; But, reading this thread has convinced me to take the plunge into the psychedelic.&nbsp; Now, I am an atheist, I must admit.&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe there&#039;s anything to this world that can&#039;t be measured by the senses.&nbsp; But, I&#039;m not convinced we know what all the senses are, and I think you&#039;ve taken your senses to places not many scientists have dared explore.&nbsp; I&#039;ll come back and visit when I have more to say, after I&#039;ve been to that particular event horizon, and have a tale of my own to tell.<br /><br />Cheers.
