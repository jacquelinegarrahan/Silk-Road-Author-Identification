				All religions involve some sort of dogma or superstition and must be rejected as being counter to logic and reason. The best way of looking at the world is without using a religious filter. <br /><br />If I had to choose a (major) religion, it would have to be Buddhism.

				I must say Taoism and Zen Buddhism because for me these are true non-Religions, they offer a way out of the belief system that there is something or someone somewhere who knows better what you ought to do and how you should live your life and then punishes or rewards you accordingly.<br /><br />All western religions (islam, christianity, judaism etc) have a God modeled on sumerian&nbsp; philosopher kings who lived 4000&nbsp; B.C. who were worshiped as gods and had god-like power. But they only offer you a way to be a good servant, which is not a bad thing per se but it also implies that there must be a king somewhere and these are often self-appointed and vicious creatures.<br /><br />I do strongly believe that materialism (atheism) should be considered as a religion because it has all the same characteristics and vocabulary (the truth monopoly, scriptures, rituals, hatred towards the other religions) than so called classical religions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Nevertheless you should be able to construct your own religion based on your needs, but remember when a religion promises to give&nbsp; you anything or satisfy your needs it is lying and manipulating with you and therefore should be avoided.

				Religion isnt physical or real or has any shred of evidence that there is a god or gods, regardless of how many million sheeple support or believe in a certain man in the sky doesnt make &quot;said god&quot; more factual, So infact they are all equally bullshit, simple things such as history books, archaeology, culture, ancient myths and legends, that equate to the reality or religion, even show us this, like it or not.

				LSD and psilocin have more truth than any religion written by man. That being said, my take on religion is that you should read through a little bit of every religion. Pick the most moving scriptures, and go from there. Religion is a personal spiritual journey. It cannot be determined by strangers, but from your own life experiences and what moves your heart.<br /><br />Good Luck.

Western culture/science often fails to see itself as a subject to this kind of classification. Religions are belief systems on which a people operate. But only to an outside standing observer this way of living seems like a religion. Only when examining culture from outside one can see that the basic axioms/postulates on which social structures are constructed are unprovable and therefore are questions of faith hence it&#039;s often called a religion with a judgment.<br /><br />There is no need for deity in religion we often fail to see our &quot;belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power&quot; whether it is a democracy or scientific revelations about the nature of the world etc, as a practitioners of this culture/religion we are unaware of it, this is the whole point of religion in my opinion, it&#039;s like an operating system on which every other application and module is running.<br /><br />I think religion isn&#039;t the same as confession, there is no such confession as hinduism, hinduism is the notion which we designate to a various people with different belief systems, mainly to define our values and ways of achieving these in contrast to other ways and values. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

It is that the world has an other definition of god than you which they kind of have the equally right to call god as you have the right to call your definition god.<br /><br />God is just a word which we have given a definition. I can call what I sleep in at night (bed) an apple. But if I go to a bed-store and ask for an apple the merchants there will most likely get confused since their definition of apple is a fruit which they don&#039;t sell. Therefore it is most practical of me to call a bed a bed and an apple an apple since that is what most people agrees on.<br /><br />With god we have the problem that people do not agree on the definition of the word. Does god means everything, the creator of the universe, the ruler of the universe, a being in a transcendental realm, a flying spaghettimonster, Julius Cesar, Lemmy (Motörhead).<br /><br />If I ask you I get the answer everything, if I ask a hardrocker I can get the answer Lemmy, if I ask a Christian I will probably get the answer the creator and ruler of the universe, if I ask a citizen of the roman empire in the year 40 BC I get a being in a transcendental realm and Julius Cesar. <br /><br />I believe Julius Cesar has existed and that Lemmy exist since I can see historical and current traces after them, so towards those gods I am a theist. I don&#039;t know how to to prove the existence of beings in transcendental realms so until someone finds out how to prove their existence it is meaningless to discuss their existence. <br /><br />Everything is usually a subgroup to something, like everything in the universe, everything inside a transistor, everything in Greek mythology, everything my mother ever told me, everything in the book of a social science class. So everything without a defined subgroup, is that everything in all subgroups (this is how I understood you)? Then god is very much and it is kind of pointless to talk about god. Since I can be specifying on how transistors are made up while you speak of the orbits of the planets.
