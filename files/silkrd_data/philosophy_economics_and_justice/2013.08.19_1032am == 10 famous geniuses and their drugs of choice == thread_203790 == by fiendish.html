				very true, It seems LSD is up there in the top ranks :D<br />Richard Feynman&#039;s experiences with LSD are very interesting to read about, If you read the book, Surely your joking mr feynman, goes into some detail on his trips and I loved reading every minute of that book. Actually the whole book itself is fascinating, I might just get it out and have a read of it I think. <br />thanks for reminding me ;)

You can see a lot of the heroin imagery in Electric Sheep - the dream machines. At least, that is what they represented to me.<br /><br />Re: Hitler<br /><br />It&#039;s not the first time I&#039;ve heard of something like it mentioned. During that time though, a lot of drug use was little recorded, as it wasn&#039;t &quot;drug use&quot; by modern definitions. That&#039;s why its frequently seen in wartime movies that people do cocaine - they did, openly.<br /><br />Famous users of such substances like mescaline and LSD are usually pretty well identified. The earliest public figure I can really see is that guy from the BBC show that got buried. Mayhew I think? He was some english bigwig. The BBC had to hide it.<br /><br />That being said, mescaline and LSD are new on the relative timescales. LSD was only discovered shortly before the invasion of poland. Mescaline was only 20 years before that. I suppose its possible that mescaline was, like heroin and cocaine, made into wonder drugs and sold openly on the market before it became the ire as well. Though that wouldn&#039;t make sense, its not nearly as easy or plentiful as the latter two.<br /><br />Hitler was an artist though - I would probably believe it better if he experimented with it before the third reich era, in the twenties perhaps, when he was younger and it was first discovered.<br /><br />Again, no records that I know of exist on it though.

				A few things id like to point out, on the second list it says &quot;was addicted to hashish&quot; which is not possible. Was a user, yes, but addict nope. <br /><br />As for Hitler and his drug use, its documented he used mescaline in his artist days yes. during the final era of his life, end of WWII, it was reported by his doctor that he was using Perpantine (speed) in the morning and Barbituates and opiates at night...may be a partial explanation to his increasingly psychotic and aggressive behavior. that and him being a total nutter anyway!

He&#039;s an amazing artist. One of my dreams is to one day own an original piece of Barret&#039;s artwork. He get&#039;s a bad rap... for how quickly and intently he disconnected from what he was with Floyd and his other bands. In reading about him I&#039;ve occasionally thought if he&#039;d been a part of a different generation, had he ever become a musician. I have somewhat come to the conclusion that he would have more likely ended up as a poet a few decades earlier... and an artist a decade or two later. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=203790.msg1483456#msg1483456">Quote from: wrathmore on August 23, 2013, 09:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A few things id like to point out, on the second list it says &quot;was addicted to hashish&quot; which is not possible.

There are plenty of posts, including a thread entirely about addiction, with people who have noted this. You can argue semantics all you want, but non-functional without a high is pretty much a basic sign.

				what&#039;s the source of Hitler doing mescaline ? It seems unlikely he used any psychedelics at all, seeing what he did to human beings. He did meth for sure. Also, I&#039;m not sure he was a Genius. Just a guy with an awesome presence, a talent for persuasion and public speaking, and most of all, a handful of excellent counselors.

				Let&#039;s not forget that alcohol is also a drug; many famous (and some infamous, like Joseph McCarthy just off the top of my head) historical figures were addicted to alcohol or abused it. It would be impossible to make a list of all the famous geniuses that were alcoholics!<br /><br />&nbsp;

				Very interesting thread, thanks!<br />No wonder LSD seems to have a good impact.<br /><br />I would guess that 80%+ of the musicians have done some drug in the past. Especially cannabis, and for good reason because cannabis alters the way of music being interpreted by you. There was a very good lecture about this topic at the cultiva 2011. I forgot the name of the prof. :(<br />It&#039;s very scientific so maybe it&#039;s not for everyone, also it is in German. ;)

				Someone mentioned how practically every musician has taken drugs, but I reckon a fairly large percentage (larger than general public) of scientists will have tried some kind of drug (probably LSD/shrooms/peyote/marijuana/speed/coke/MDMA). In fact, a resent study showed that people who had tried drugs were more intelligent on average than people who had not (though, obviously would still be represented by the usual bell-curve distribution). I heard recently on this TYT segment:<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOdrj3EdzAA<br /><br />But according to another couple of articles I&#039;ve found, this info seems to have been around for a while, as these are from 2011 &amp; 2010:<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201010/why-intelligent-people-use-more-drugs<br />http://www.nhs.uk/news/2011/11November/Pages/intelligent-children-illegal-drug-use.aspx<br /><br />So it would make sense that academics of all kinds, inc. scientists, are more likely to have used drugs. Probably they&#039;re just cleaver enough to know they should keep it to themselves less face professional disgrace, unless you&#039;ve already made a name for yourself (like Feynman).<br /><br />

That can be interpreted as a form of intelligence I would say. Building their own opinion, questioning the information that they got and then deciding for themselves.

I can&#039;t find anything about Tesla doing drugs, but since at the end of his life he fell in love with an imaginary laser pigeon, perhaps he didn&#039;t need any.<br /><br />In the scope of this thread it&#039;s perhaps also interesting to note that many doctors and scientists use prescription drugs like methylphenidate and modafinil.
