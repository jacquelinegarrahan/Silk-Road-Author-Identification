				from sociopath world <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This will be interesting and relevant to many of you. A reader sent me this article about recent research performed on the moral leanings of libertarians, &quot;Understanding Libertarian Morality: The psychological roots of an individualist ideology.&quot; As described by Reason:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; When it comes to morality, libertarians are often typecast as immoral calculating rationalists who also have a somewhat unseemly hedonistic bent. Now new social science research shows that libertarians are quite moral, just not in the same way that conservatives and liberals are.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ***<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; [T]he study found that libertarians show (1) stronger endorsement of individual liberty as their foremost guiding principle and correspondingly weaker endorsement of other moral principles, (2) a relatively cerebral as opposed to emotional intellectual style, and (3) lower interdependence and social relatedness.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; In his earlier work, Haidt surveyed the attitudes of conservatives and liberals using what he calls the Moral Foundations Questionnaire which measures how much a person relies on each of five different moral foundations: Harm/Care, Fairness/Reciprocity, Ingroup/Loyalty, Authority/Respect, and Purity/Sanctity. Typically, conservatives scored lower than liberals on the Harm and Fairness scales and much higher on Ingroup, Authority, and Purity scales. In this case, libertarians scored low on all five surveyed moral dimensions. “Libertarians share with liberals a distaste for the morality of Ingroup, Authority, and Purity characteristic of social conservatives, particularly those on the religious right,” notes the study. Libertarians scored slightly below conservatives on Harm and slightly above on Fairness. This suggests that libertarians “are therefore likely to be less responsive than liberals to moral appeals from groups who claim to be victimized, oppressed, or treated unfairly.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Schwartz Value scale measures the degree to which participants regard 10 values as guiding principles for their lives. Libertarians put higher value on Hedonism, Self-Direction, and Stimulation than either liberals or conservatives and they put less value than either on Benevolence, Conformity, Security, and Tradition. Like liberals, libertarians put less value on Power, but like conservatives they value Universalism less. Universalism is defined as “understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection of the welfare of all people and nature.” All three put high value on Achievement. Taking these results into account, Haidt concludes that “libertarians appear to live in a world where traditional moral concerns (e.g., respect for authority, personal sanctity) are not assigned much importance.”<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ***<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Libertarians may fear that the moral concerns typically endorsed by liberals or conservatives are claims that can be used to trample upon individual rights—libertarians’ sacred value.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ***<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “Libertarians are high in Openness to Experience and seem to enjoy effortful and thoughtful cognitive tasks. In combination with low levels of emotional reactivity, the highly rational nature of libertarians may lead them to a logical, rather than emotional, system of morality.”<br /><br />Probably the most interesting part of this article, though, was the discussion of the Empathizer-Systematizer scale:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The scale measures the tendency to empathize, defined as &quot;the drive to identify another person&#039;s emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion,&quot; and to systemize, or &quot;the drive to analyze the variables in a system, and to derive the underlying rules that govern the behavior of the system.&quot; Libertarians are the only group that scored higher on systemizing than on empathizing—and they scored a lot higher. The authors go on to suggest that systemizing is “characteristic of the male brain, with very extreme scores indicating autism.” They then add, “We might say that liberals have the most ‘feminine’ cognitive style, and libertarians the most ‘masculine.’”<br /><br />Yes, tendency to systematize instead of empathize is something that libertarians, sociopaths, and autistics have in common. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				A fascinating article, thanks for sharing!&nbsp; &nbsp;:)<br /><br />This makes perfect sense to me too based on my observation of various politically polarized people.&nbsp; My own past association with Libertarianism was largely driven by my desire to live in a rationally derived form of government, with logical consistency, exactly as the study suggests.&nbsp; I&#039;ve since abandoned it in view of a better understanding of the reality of human nature, which makes the pure Libertarian ideal society untenable.<br /><br />However, one of the main things I take away from this article, is that most people are in fact moral actors, and wish to conduct themselves morally.&nbsp; This means, in other words, that most people are well intentioned.&nbsp; This is something I very much believe (I&#039;m a big supporter of humanity, we&#039;re very cool critters).<br /><br />The only problem is that old adage about the road to hell being paved with good intentions.&nbsp; This is how I felt about the Dubb-Ya presidency.&nbsp; Unlike may people, I don&#039;t think he was evil or anything...I believe he was in fact well intentioned...just very, very wrong.<br /><br />These days I don&#039;t really fit into any specific political category...I tend to be fiscally conservative and socially liberal.&nbsp; I wonder how I&#039;d score on those tests?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; <br /><br />R
