				On a semi cold, cloudy 3rd of July, I made my way down the mountain and made my way around the City of Angels.&nbsp; <br />Tears fill my eyes as I write because I have a feeling i NEVER had before.<br /><br />Allow me to back up a couple days while I been gone in the no hotspot/wifi zones of the L.A. national forest.<br />5,000 feet up in the air, I wished many a times I could reach the clouds and speak to y&#039;all.<br />on my hike up the mountains I spoke to many home-frees and like I suspected many said there is a camp, and many didn&#039;t.&nbsp; They all did confirm massive amounts of federal agents in the forest, including possible BLACKWATER sightings. <br />One possible coincidence was all the low flying military-like(I have not confirmed they&#039;re military) choppers.<br />Either way I personally seen no camp.<br />Then one man stood out among the others USMC .issue dessert DIGI pants. <br />I met him laying in the sun with a look of discontent whistling the intro to war&#039;s low-rider.&nbsp; I starting singing and dancing along. He suddenly stopped and with a very serious look he only said &quot;WAR&quot;<br />I looked back stunned and replied,<br />&quot;I tried to tell everyone, but in the matrix they made to think you crazy.&quot;&#039;<br />&quot;&#039;Tellém what?&quot;&#039; he asked<br />to catch and protect myself from a possible agent I quickly said,<br />&quot;That the classics like WAR is making a comeback soon.&quot;<br />then I started sing Buffalo Springfield - For What Its Worth.<br />After that he teared up, which in return lead to me tearing. <br />I knew I found another BANDANA. <br /><br />Without hesitation he said <br />&quot;come and see&quot; <br />and I looked and behold,<br />A pale horse, <br />his name was death and hell followed with him. --- Johnny Cash<br /><br />CASKET &quot;LINERS&quot;....<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t care what you read or did not.<br />GO TO LOCATION AT THE END OF STONYVALE OFF BIG TUHUNGA RD IN THE L.A, NAT. FOREST!<br />I have SEEN&nbsp; seen more then I could count. <br />Big enough to fit many in each.&nbsp; <br /><br />He said, <br />&quot;This is more acceptable then throwing ém in a hole, Acceptance is everything&quot;<br /><br />I sat in awe after smoking a blunt with the man for the rest of the day.<br />We didn&#039;t mention it to each other again.<br />the only other thing he said about the topic was,<br />&nbsp;&quot;please have a very very safe 4th&quot;<br />.<br />&nbsp;Allow me to return to that topic.<br /><br />First I need to immortalize in our clouds someone I miss.<br /><br /><br />She is absolutely beautiful inside and out.<br />She was treated worse then a dog in these streets.<br />She carried a dirty blanket, jacket and a lot of trauma which made her appear &quot;special&quot;<br />All I wanted to do was GIVE her something better.<br />After months of keeping her warm in my bedroll, which is more time than I ever spent with someone without ever trying to make an advance.<br />with big smiles she once asked me if she saved up the money for us, would I accompany her to six flags.<br />This touched me in a way I can&#039;t explain. This girl can&#039;t afford to eat, and she wanted to pay for us to go to six flags, I said,<br />&quot;Of course baby girl, I&#039;d love to.&quot;<br />That day she got picked up on sleeping in public warrants and I haven&#039;t seen her again.<br />The police wouldn&#039;t even give me info on how to find her, they said it was<br />&quot;out of their hands.&quot;<br />I still have hope.<br /><br />Returning back to topic, I left the forest this morning and couldn&#039;t believe the word on the streets.<br /><br />EVERYONE IN THE STREETS OF L.A. BELIEVES SOMETHING BIG IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW...<br />I heard two guys saying there&#039;s going to be a lot of booming by the police, and that they where going to bang back...<br />I thought 2 things<br /><br />What did I miss?<br />Please no, not yet, <br /><br />NON POSSUM ILLA VESCOR...<br />&nbsp;<br />PLEASE BROTHERS AND SISTERS, DON&#039;T CARRY A WEAPON TODAY OUTSIDE YOUR HOMES.<br />And pray that armed march on DC do NOT HAPPEN tomorrow.<br />SOMEONE(s) MAY BE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO TAKE OUR INDEPENDENCE&nbsp; THIS INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br /><br />Please brothers and sisters, stay safe AT HOME.<br />especially anyone from Southern California.<br /><br />I was once told I will die for this...<br />I now fully came to grasps that they where right. <br /><br />I been working on this project for a while and tried quite a bit to get the start up capital. It still amazes me how hard it was to get nowhere. I had about $600 saved, but the cops robbed me while taking me in for a warrant. I was handcuffed with $600, left with $10. I talked to a lawyer and he simply looked like a desperado when he said,<br />you know they&#039;ll believe a cop over a, don&#039;t mind me, but a beach bum supposedly holding $600.<br />Damn it too, he was right.<br />but I&#039;ll fight to the death.<br /><br />Bless you all, stay vigilant tomorrow.<br />I will Pray for you all.<br /><br />LET THE&nbsp; Shoreline RUMORS START, LISTEN TO E-DUBBLE - DOGFACE GO -----CAREFULLY.<br />
