				Everybody that searched and found this post hopefully thinks of themselves as the best-of-the-best as they out of more then a billion people that have access to the internet _(yes more then a billion)_&quot; have looked up this web address on the tor network&quot;. Sit down, relax and get into a good mood.<br /><br />Ok so this is mostly philosophy still I&#039;d like scientific thought that is theory(thinking-?) and hypothesis(thought-?)<br /><br />So the basic primeis comes&nbsp; from simply feeling good I&#039;ve equated that to 1sq in of matter for 1 second equals 1. (That about both the tips of your index fingers put together not counting past the lines). So scientifically I eat grow myself with the matter that was once dirt then a plant then becomes me and with the right stimuli I feel good. I believe that our preceved existence is only that of our inner-consciousness that is until we think other-wise. I believe that the inner-consciousness is the pituitary gland in the brain that part simply getting stimuli from the rest of the body and brain. So my once perceived existence was only 1:400 of the real scale of myself roughly anyway. So whats with that well I&#039;d say the outer-consciousness is more like a calculator and the inner-consciousness is more like a plant. So to be certain of what all else is feeling we would have to bond link whatever with all and then we could be certain in the moment. This may seem like an impractical philosophy from a live death (nothing) perspective but people die and the matter that they&#039;re made of will likely live again as worms that&#039;s why im getting buried under a tree.<br /><br />Scientific book with an important paragraph<br /><br />How in the world:published 1990; pg 292-293: paragraph How do anaesthetics numb pain?: sub-paragraph &quot;Atoms that transmit pain&quot;<br /><br />A clue to the way general anaesthetics work comes from research into local anaesthetics. these are known to interfere with the way nerve impulses are transmitted along the nerve fibres. Sodium and potassium atoms play an important part in sending these impulses to the brain. If you stub your toe, for example, the sodium and potassium atoms pass in opposite directions across the membrane of the nerve cell causing the next cell to do the same and so on until the signal reaches the brain, when you feel pain. But local anaesthetics stop the atoms from passing in and out of the nerve cell, so no pain signal reaches the spinal cord. <br />&nbsp; Scientists think that general anaesthetics may cause unconsciousness by suppressing the activity of certain enzymes in the nerve cells, or changing the properties of the nerve cell membranes, or even by interacting with water molecules in the brain to form small crystals which affect the path of a signal along a nerve cell.<br />&nbsp; Research continues into the exact mechanism, but what is certain is that without anaesthetics a great deal of surgery could never be performed.<br />&nbsp;
