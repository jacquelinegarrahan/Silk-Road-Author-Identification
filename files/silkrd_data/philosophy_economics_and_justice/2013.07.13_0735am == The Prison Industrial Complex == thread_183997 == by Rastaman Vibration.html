				Privatized prisons are big business in America. Corporations are profiting from incarcerating people and taking them away from their families and communities. Not to mention, reinstating institutionalized slavery. And surprise, surprise, most of the victims are black or Hispanic.<br /><br />Here&#039;s an interesting article about it:<br />http://www.activistpost.com/2013/06/the-prison-industrial-complex.html&nbsp; (Clearnet, duh)<br /><br /><br />Prisons are also economic strategies for small towns across America. In a lot of places, the prison is the ONLY economic engine. In fact, towns compete with each other and offer incentives to the prison corporations so the prison will get built in their town. <br /><br />Here&#039;s a great read on that:<br />http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/building.html (Ditto)<br /><br />Motherfucking Babylon!

				Thanks for the read Rasta Vib.<br /><br /><br />If one makes it profitable to lock folks up, well, they&#039;re going to keep on locking folks up. Money is power. Power is control. <br /><br />Money is used by the institutes of power to control.<br /><br />It&#039;s sad really, disillusioning in fact; but alas, there is no &quot;utopia&quot;. Man is incapable of that, as man is an imperfect creature.<br /><br /><br /><br />(excuse my philosophic-blahblah, it&#039;s late. :) )<br /><br /><br />

				I don&#039;t have enough condemning words for this thread&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />I do remember something interesting and somewhat positive I heard recently.&nbsp; I believe it involved privatized prisons and how some gang members or gangs were wising up and actually buying stocks in the prison, because of the rate of incarceration for these individuals they were actually making a good investment into their future, even if in an odd way&nbsp; :).&nbsp; I haven&#039;t gotten around to checking the full story but it was very interesting and I will look more into it cause I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t have the details correct, but you get the picture.

				Hm that is interesting. I hadn&#039;t heard about privatized prisons before but it doesn&#039;t surprise me. This type of trend is prevalent in most industries.

				cca is a bitch. private industry in collusion with the dea local law enforcements and of course the courts; practicing obvious slavery. they absolutely prey upon smaller communities with a heavy concentration of presence in the &quot;hood&quot;, setting up traffic stops and traps.&nbsp; the cops.treat this as a game of cat and mouse with absolutely no integrity he local communities hide behind city ordinance for charges like weed, giving most offenders probation drug tests and a record. yea seriously, most these judges prosecutors and cops deserve death, they have been reduced to a inhuman cancer, and get no respect.&nbsp; the general population are mind controlled over medicated mentally and physically obese impoverished zombies unable to understand these clear realities; they lost their soul.<br /><br />they all will be absorbed within there own hell when the time comes, our job is to educate and practice truth, eventually their lies will collapse on themselves crushing them and their false low end ideologies<br />

				I agree with you guys.&nbsp; This shit really gets my blood boiling.&nbsp; We&#039;re talking about human lives here!&nbsp; And lives that are essentially destroyed once you enter the prison system. <br /><br />I hate how in America we&#039;re creating a financial incentive to put people in prison.&nbsp; A lot of things people get put into prison for are dumb and the laws need wiped off the books.&nbsp; Shall I start with arresting people for marijuana possession?&nbsp; What a fucking joke.&nbsp; You mean to tell me my hard earned tax dollars are going to be put towards putting someone in jail for smoking a plant or growing a plant?&nbsp; BS!&nbsp; And what really sucks is once someone enters the prison system it often becomes a revolving door.&nbsp; Say you get out of jail and want to go look for a job.&nbsp; Hardly anyone will want to hire you.&nbsp; You&#039;ll resort to dealing and doing what you gotta do to survive in a lot of cases.&nbsp; There is no rehab in prison.&nbsp; And because of lack of funds for mental institutions a lot of mentally ill people end up in prison.&nbsp; These people need help and they&#039;re not getting it because someone is too busy filling their own pockets and doing things by their own agenda which is incarcerating people.&nbsp;
