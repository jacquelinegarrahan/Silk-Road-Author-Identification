				Ha ha! My old nemesis - Jay92!!&nbsp; &nbsp;8)<br /><br />If you&#039;re referring to the USA then no, you don&#039;t live in a fascist state. <br />A fascist state wouldn&#039;t have laws that prohibit arrest without cause, search and seizure without warrant and suppress the existence of a free press. Furthermore there would be no anti-hate laws, the courts would be radically changed in a very short time to stack judges of a similar mindset and you would be forced to pledge alliance to the flag every morning at school or the workplace and at every public gathering.<br /><br />So no young Jay, you really don&#039;t live in a fascist state.<br /><br />Now if you&#039;ll excuse me I&#039;m going to blow a huge oil laden joint on my balcony and effectively flip the bird to my neighbors.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)

				Wackmanblu, please read about the NDAA and Patriot Act and then tell me if you think people can&#039;t be arrested without cause, and have their things seized without cause. The NDAA, for example, allows for you to be detained indefinitely, without you being told what the charges are against you, and without legal council.

				Google National Defense Authorization Act. It was passed by Obama and it does exactly what my previous post states.The Patriot Act was passed by George Bush after 9/11, Clinton tried to pass it after the Oklahoma City bombing, but (and this is well documented) not enough people were killed in the Oklahoma City bombing to pass the Patriot Act. Then boom Bush gets elected and 9/11 happens, and wouldn&#039;t you know it? Enough people were killed to pass the act. The Patriot Act is rather similar to the NDAA, in that it allows the government mainly the NSA (National Security Agency) to listen in to your phone conversations, without a warrant. Amongst other things.

				Okay, so I goggled National Defense Authorization Act&nbsp; - there&#039;s a few links to Wikipedia and Forbes and if I go way to page 10 of search results I get some wing-nut National Inquirer type links.&nbsp; hmm, nothing that plainly links this Act to fascism in America.<br /><br />The Patriot Act turns up better results for you in that it links to the actual act as it was written. So where then, exactly what clause are you referring to?

				You have to link it yourself by reading the literature, it won&#039;t plainly say &quot;this is fascism&quot; lol. As for the clauses this information is in, I do not know exactly, you&#039;ll just have to do a little research brother. I have some good books that mention the acts and the literature in them. They&#039;re honestly really good books and you could take a lot from them if you read them.

				Yes, the USA is a fascist state.&nbsp; Such is the case in late capitalism.&nbsp; Nobody understands the extent to which the worker and oppressed are exploited more than the capitalist class and they will and are doing anything and everything to continue their lavish lifestyles at the expense of the rest of us.&nbsp; Comrades in Greece are showing us how to approach the state, burn it down.

				You are victim to right-wing propaganda. They just love the term fascist because of the Nazi analogy. The reason it is idiotically wrong to apply the term to the US is that in a &quot;fascist&quot; state, government controls (aside from what they enforce unto their citizens) business and the way its done.<br /><br />Everyone knows that in the US, big business controls the government, matter of fact, the US has the best government money can buy, thank you citizens united. But there goes the &quot;fascist&quot; analogy out of the window. A fascist state would force its economy (businesses) into their ideological confines, in the US, big business does however they please without regard for national interest. That defies the very definition of fascism.<br /><br />To everyone going to &quot;survival camp&quot; in the mountains to train for the revolution and to learn how to horde canned goods and ammo in the basement I suggest more college - less tinfoil hats.<br /><br />The US government is incredibly bad at serving the mass of its citizens proper, but in order to fix that people need to start to understand (I mean understand, not make up shit in their heads) what is broken with it and how.<br /><br />Paranoia- and hate-fueled delusions contribute exactly zilch to the undesirable status quo. As a matter of fact, I personally believe that these &quot;delusions&quot; are part of the reason the general population doesn&#039;t get a grasp of this highly complex issue. Creating straw-men arguments (EPA THE NEW ENEMY!!!) keeps people from really thinking in favor of making up simplified made up explanations fancying their pet grievances.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, all those survivalists and revolutionaries and what have you are just as much sheep as your average John Q. Taxpayer, they&#039;re only member of another herd.

The nationalist component is really absent in this current government of the last 50 years or so. A truly &quot;fascist&quot; government would not sell the nation out to China. Or even allow you to buy all their cheap shit at walmart all over the country.<br /><br />If anything, then America is an extreme plutocracy, a result of lessaiz-fair capitalism. Which in turn is a result of a &quot;more freedoms&quot; approach over the last 30 or 40 years. But I digress. In summary, despite the fact that DEA agents raiding a house may visually remind you of something you saw about the Nazis raiding a Jewish household on the history channel, the analogies to fascism and the Nazis are fallacious at best.<br /><br />What we have in the US is a whole new animal that has never been seen before in world history. The unrestrained concentration of wealth to very few individuals paired with an election process that basically favors the nominee with access to the most funds while providing &quot;dark channels&quot; to individuals to get their tremendous wealth to work in the democratic process. All this is very far from the definition of fascism.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I am not saying that what we are facing today isn&#039;t as &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;despicable&quot; as fascism, but it is not fascism by definition.

				Yes, absolutely. The US has got all three of fascism&#039;s essential main components - nationalism, militarism, and a state/corporate complex. Most of the major changes to underlying principles of American government after the Civil War happened before World War II, when fascism was still trendy. They were made in the open, and they were never repealed.<br /><br />What&#039;s being discussed here actually seems to be whether or not the US is a police state. Well, there are dozens of doors kicked in every hour for searches performed without warrants. We have Federal acts that give law enforcement the ability to WRITE THEIR OWN WARRANTS (something over which the founders went to war with George III for God&#039;s sake). The mere accusation of terrorist affiliations is grounds for indefinite detention per the PATRIOT Act and NDAA, and per the former you&#039;re not even allowed to tell anyone if you&#039;re detained on those grounds. Besides that there are so many laws that almost everyone is a felon without even knowing it. Local police departments have been militarized in large cities and are being militarized in large towns, and the police are basically King&#039;s Men who can literally get away with murder unless it&#039;s just heinous enough to embarrass the state. If this isn&#039;t a police state, I&#039;d like to know what the criteria should be to define it as one.

Check. Most definitely.<br /><br />Nationalism. I disagree. The mere overabundance of red white and blue &quot;propaganda&quot; materials, constant display of &quot;patriotic&quot; rhetoric or even the prevalent opinion of American &quot;exceptionalism&quot; do not constitute nationalism. Nationalism would encompass actions and policies that favor the national interest. As I have mentioned in an earlier post, recent administrations have, to the fullest extent and without restraint, instituted policies that favor the export of American jobs and wealth to foreign countries while increasing our dependence on foreign oil. Or think NAFTA. No truly nationalist nation would institute anything remotely resembling NAFTA. These are NOT AT ALL nationalist actions. Yes, we might easily be mistaken for a &quot;nationalist&quot; country with our penchant for flags and speeches everywhere, but in the end it is the deeds and not the words that define whether a nation is truly nationalist or not.<br /><br />State/Corporate complex. Yes we have one, but its upside-down and backwards compared to that you would see in fascism. In fascism, the state imposes its ideology onto the corporate world (don&#039;t sell or lend to Jews, don&#039;t produce anything undermining the national pride, prioritize your production by what the state needs, not what the market demands). In the US, it is the other way around, mega-corporations with unimaginable financial resources force government into making policy that suits them. The &quot;job creators&quot; have de facto installed themselves as the new bourgeoisie, powerful enough to make or break any candidate contemplating to run for office. Neither the public nor the government decide who gets into office, the billions at the disposal of the Addelsons of the country do. That also is the complete antithesis of fascism. To put it simply, in fascism, the state would determine who gets to be the CEO of a big corporation, in this thing we have, big CEOs determine who gets to be a politician.<br /><br />So, whilst I can see where one might draw parallels or even get confused, what we have has nothing to do with fascism by definition.

				Point conceded on nationalism. I would say, however, that there are certain elements in both parties that actually ARE nationalist by your definition; they have been in power and probably will be again eventually. I suppose it doesn&#039;t make the US fascist as a whole because they didn&#039;t get their agendas passed extensively.<br /><br />But on corporatism, the state corporate complex is ALWAYS a symbiosis in practice, regardless of what it is supposed to be in theory. It was a symbiosis in Italy under Mussolini and in Germany under Hitler. Neither despot could have ruled without a regimented and complicit merchant class, and the latter had no shortage of compensation for cooperating. There are certainly differences in kind between the USA&#039;s brand of fascism and that of war-era European fascism, but I think that in terms of economic fascism the difference is only one of degree.

That would raise the question, whether true fascism would require the agenda of that symbiotic complex to be in the national interest as per the definition of nationalism, or if pure profit motive would still qualify as &quot;fascist agenda&quot;<br /><br />Very interesting point.<br /><br />On a lighter note though and as some comic relieve, I dun think the tinfoil hats hording canned goods and ammo in the storm cellar really make such contemplations.

				Hey, I save up canned food and ammo. 50 years ago it was called &quot;keeping a pantry&quot;.

				reviving an old thread.<br /><br />Nationalism: The U.S. is highly nationalistic. U.S. exceptionalism, politicians wrapping themselves in the flag, foreign interventions for domestic security purposes (imagined), wars for resource control, economic stimulus to help boost the national economy while simultaneously calling on foreign central banks to buy up these Dollars, exporting the inflation to the detriment of the poor in other countries. <br /><br />Earlier posters wrote that the U.S. is not fascist because the government does not control big business, but instead it&#039;s the other way around. This is a distinction without a difference. The central banking model tied with a regulatory regime which promotes monopoly is fascist.<br /><br />As George Carlin said, Fascism will come to America with a smiley face.<br /><br />I think previous posters are afraid to call the U.S. a fascist state, because of the atrocities of previous fascist states. NAZI Germany was fascist before the holocaust. Italy was fascist and did not commit mass genocide.<br /><br />Fascism is a cooperation between corporations and the state under a central banking system. One of these in this corporatist complex may have more power than the others, and I think looking at history and contemporary events, it appears the central banks are the true power centers. When money is created, those that receive the money first receive a large transfer of wealth from the middle class and poor. The power of a central bank is so immense.<br /><br />I also wouldn&#039;t call this &quot;late capitalism&quot; as some of the comrades said earlier. Capitalism began to die in 1913 in the U.S. and the fascist state began in 1933.&nbsp; Hell, there is a video of Goebbels complimenting FDR on his fascist policies to reduce unemployment in the U.S. before the war began<br /><br />Or shall we consider when the Department of Education began or 1971 when the Gold Window was closed as the start?<br /><br />

				What OP may be trying to say is that fascism in the past has many similarities to &quot;inverted totalitarianism&quot; which we in the U.S. have now. What really is the difference between money and power? The income disparity and wholesale human suffering are wonderfully described in Chris Hedges books. Also, Naomi Wolf&#039;s &quot;End of America&quot; is a good read for a well drawn out comparison between the past and present&#039;s journey to the same ends.
