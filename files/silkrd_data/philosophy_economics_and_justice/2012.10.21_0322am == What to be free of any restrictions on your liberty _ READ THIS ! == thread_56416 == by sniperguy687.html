				Notice of Understanding and Intent And Claim of Right<br />I, Robert Arthur: Menard, a flesh and blood man and blessed living Soul serving God alone, do hereby make Oath and state the following is My Truth and My Law:<br />Whereas it is my understanding Canada is a common law jurisdiction, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding equality before the law is paramount and mandatory, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding a statute is defined as a legislated rule of society which has been given the force of law, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding a society is defined as a number of people joined by mutual consent to deliberate, determine and act for a common goal, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that for something to exist legally it must have a name, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding the only form of government recognized as lawful in Canada is a representative one, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding representation requires mutual consent, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that in the absence of mutual consent neither representation nor governance can exist, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding all Acts are statutes restricted in scope and applicability by the Constitution Act, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding Section 32 of the Constitution Act limits it to members and employees of government, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding those who have a SIN (Social Insurance Number) are in fact employees of the federal government and thus are bound by the statutes created by the federal government, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that it is lawful to abandon one’s SIN, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding people in Canada have a right to revoke or deny consent to be represented and thus governed, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding if anyone does revoke or deny consent they exist free of government control and statutory restraints, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that a claim of right establishes a lawful excuse and that this factual truth is expressed in Section 39 of the Criminal Code of Canada, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that if one has lawful excuse one may choose to not obey a court, tribunal, statute, Act or order, and that this factual truth is expressed in Sections 126 and 127 of the Criminal Code of Canada, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that Section 15 of the Criminal Code of Canada does not clearly express that one may be charged for failure to obey a de facto government or court, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that all existing courts and governments are de facto only and not de jure, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that a man by the name of Marc Dumais did while acting as a General in the Canadian Armed Forces sign an agreement allowing for foreign armed soldiers to be used in Canada against Canadians, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that this agreement was signed in conspiracy with Stephen Harper, a man playing the role of Premier of Canada, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that Section 46 of the Criminal Code of Canada states that every one commits treason if amongst other things they levee war against Canada or do any act preparatory thereto; or without lawful authority, communicates or makes available to an agent of a state other than Canada, military or scientific information or any sketch, plan, model, article, note or document of a military or scientific character that he knows or ought to know may be used by that state for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or defence of Canada, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the agreement they entered into was done in secrecy and without public input or discussion and in contravention of Section 46 of the Criminal Code of Canada, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that as a Freeman-on-the-Land in this common law jurisdiction that I have the duty to stand in defence of the Country of Canada and it’s people against foreign armed troops who attempt to invade, govern or police me or my Country, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that this duty is not affected by agreements made by treasonous and de facto government agents, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that a Canadian General does not have the power or mandate to enter into Treaties with a foreign power, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that agreements made on behalf of Canada by traitors to Canada do not bind the people of Canada, and,<br />Whereas I do firmly and truly believe the aforementioned agreement is an overt act of treason, and,<br />Whereas I honourably refuse to be bound by agreements made by traitors such as Marc Dumais and Stephen Harper seem to be, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that any peace officer who co-operates with foreign armed troops to govern or regulate the population is also committing treason, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that historically the purpose of a national armed force was to ensure that foreign powers never invaded and governed under a gun, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the existence of armed foreign troops patrolling and policing our streets is evidence of a war fought unsuccessfully, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that agreeing or conspiring to agree to allow armed foreign troops to patrol and police our streets is an act of treason, and,<br />Whereas a Freeman-on-the-Land has lawfully revoked consent and does exist free of statutory restrictions, obligations, and limitations, and,<br />Whereas I, _________________________________________ am a Freeman-on-the-Land, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that acting peacefully within community standards does not breach<br />the peace, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that any action for which one can apply for and receive a license must itself be a fundamentally lawful action, and,<br />Whereas as I not a child and I am a Freeman-on-the-Land who operates with full responsibility and I do not see the need to ask permission to engage in lawful and peaceful activities, especially from those who claim limited liability, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding a by-law is defined as a rule of a corporation, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding corporations are legal fictions and require contracts in order to claim authority or control over other parties, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding legal fictions lack a soul and cannot exert any control over those who are thus blessed and operate with respect to that knowledge as only a fool would allow soulless fictions to dictate ones actions, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that I can use a Notary Public to perform duties found under any Act including thus they have the power to hold court and hear evidence and issue binding lawful judgments, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that a Notary Public can also be used to bring criminal charges to bear against traitors, even if they hold the highest office, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that I have a right to use my property without having to pay for the use or enjoyment of it, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that Sky Train and all other ‘public transportation’ is in fact and actuality public property to which I have the right of use and access without having to pay, and,<br />Whereas I claim the right to collect a pension if I have paid into it and claim that said right is not affected if I abandon my Social Insurance Number, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that a summons is merely an invitation to attend and the ones issued by the British Columbia Securities Commission create no obligation or dishonor if ignored, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding peace officers have a duty to distinguish between statutes and law and those who attempt to enforce statutes against a Freeman-on-the-Land are in fact breaking the law, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that I have the power to refuse intercourse or interaction with peace officers who have not observed me breach the peace, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that permanent estoppel by acquiescence barring any peace officer or prosecutor from bringing charges against a Freeman-on-the-Land under any Act is created if this claim is not responded to in the stated fashion and time, and<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the common law right to travel on the highways without license provided we are not engaging in commerce thereupon is lawful and still exists although it does appear to have been deceptively hidden, and,<br />Whereas I have been stopped, assaulted and abducted under the color of law by peace officers who either knew or should have known better, and,<br />Whereas the Highway Safety Act of British Columbia does make it an offence for peace officers to stop an automobile in order to provide services and demand something of value, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that if they are not providing a service they have no reason to stop any one and if proof of registration, insurance and license is not valuable they have no need to ask for it, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that I have the right to refuse to interact or co-operate with criminals, de facto government agents or grossly negligent peace officers, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the Bible states ‘Blessed be the peace makers, for they shall be called The Sons of God, and,<br />Whereas I do truly see those words as an invitation and offer to be a peace maker otherwise known as peace officer, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that if I have the power to elect a representative and empower them to appoint peace officers then I also have the power to appoint directly, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that if I have the power to appoint directly or by proxy I must have the power to fulfill those duties my self, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police although having an illustrious history has had members recently acting in a grossly criminal manner which does tarnish the previous history and record, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the Law provides remedy at all times, even against rogue or negligent peace officers and de facto governments apparently hijacked by soulless corporate interests, and,<br />Whereas I do desire to be blessed and called a Son of God, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that in order to be a peace maker and deal with rogue armed police officers who fail to act with respect to the Criminal Code of Canada I will need use of and access to firearms of equal or greater power then those people who act criminally have access to, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that people within the Nova Scotia Securities Commission and The British Columbia Securities Commission use deception and fraud to exercise authority unlawfully and outside their mandates, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the act of registering the birth of a baby creates a legal entity called a person that exists in association with that baby and that the manner in which offspring are registered transfers superior guardianship rights over that offspring to the government, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that this creation of a person and transfer of authority is not fully disclosed to the parents and if it was all good parents would refuse to register their offspring, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the person and the human being to which it is associated are two very separate and different things and that the people playing roles in government only have the right to act upon the person, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that if I do not exist in association with a person I cannot be lawfully governed by the people playing roles in government, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that I am not obliged to obey the orders of any one claiming to be a Queen or King or those acting on behalf of such an insane entity, as no one who does make preposterous claims that abandon and erode the concept of equality has any authority over me, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the Bible warns all players and actors of de facto courts “judge not lest you be judged”, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that the people in the government are merely playing roles, and,<br />Whereas I AM NOT PLAYING, and,<br />Whereas it is my understanding that there is more of this to follow<br />Therefore be it now known to any and all interested, concerned or affected parties, that I, _____________________________ am a Freeman-on-the-Land and do hereby serve notice and state clearly specifically and unequivocally my intent to peacefully and lawfully exist free of all statutory obligations, restrictions and that I maintain all rights at law to trade, exchange or barter and exist without deceptive governance and to do so without limitations, restrictions or regulations created by others and without my consent.<br />Furthermore, I claim that these actions are not outside my communities’ standards and will in fact support said community in our desire for truth and maximum freedom.<br />Furthermore, I claim the right to engage in these actions and further claim that all property held by me is held under a claim of right as mentioned in the Criminal Code of Canada.<br />Furthermore, I claim that anyone who interferes with my lawful activities after having been served notice of this claim and who fails to properly dispute or make lawful counterclaim is breaking the law, cannot claim good faith or colour of right and that such transgressions will be dealt with in a properly convened court de jure.<br />Furthermore, I claim that the courts in British Columbia are de-facto and bound by the Law and Equity Act and are in fact in the profitable business of conducting, witnessing and facilitating the transactions of security interests and I further claim they require the consent of both parties prior to providing any such services.<br />Furthermore, I claim all transactions of security interests require the consent of both parties and I do hereby deny consent to any transaction of a security interest issuing under any Act for as herein stated as a Freeman-on-the-Land I am not subject to any Act.<br />Furthermore, I claim my FEE SCHEDULE for any transgressions by peace officers, government principals or agents or justice system participants is FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUR or portion thereof if being questioned, interrogated or in any way detained, harassed or otherwise regulated and FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HOUR or portion thereof if I am handcuffed, transported, incarcerated or subjected to any adjudication process without my express written and Notarized consent.<br />Furthermore, I claim the right to use a Notary Public to secure payment of the aforementioned FEE SCHEDULE against any transgressors who by their actions or omissions harm me or my interests, directly or by proxy in any way.<br />Furthermore, I claim the right to convene a proper court de jure in order to address any potentially criminal actions of any peace officers, government principals or agents or justice system participants who having been served notice of this claim fail to dispute or discuss or make lawful counterclaim and then interfere by act or omission with the lawful exercise of properly claimed and established rights and freedoms.<br />Furthermore, I claim the law of agent and principal applies and that service upon one is service upon both.<br />Furthermore, I claim the right to deal with any counterclaims or disputes publicly and in an open forum using discussion and negotiation and to capture on video tape said discussion and negotiation for whatever lawful purpose as I see fit.<br />Furthermore, I claim the right to fulfill my duty to shoot any foreign troops in Canada who are armed and attempting to police or govern me or other Canadians without consent and to view them as an invading force which must be lawfully attacked.<br />Affected parties wishing to dispute the claims made herein or make their own counterclaims must respond appropriately within FOURTEEN (14) days of service of notice of this action. Responses must be under Oath or attestation, upon full commercial liability and penalty of perjury and registered in the Notary Office herein provided no later than fourteen days from the date of original service as attested to by way of certificate of service.<br />Failure to register a dispute against the claims made herein and then successfully defeating these claims in a proper court of law will result in an automatic default judgment securing forevermore all rights herein claimed and establishing permanent and irrevocable estoppel by acquiescence barring the bringing of charges under any statute or Act or regulation against My Self Freeman-on-the-Land ______________________________ for exercising these lawful and properly established rights, freedoms and duties.<br />Place of Claim of Right: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada<br />Dated: __________________________________<br />Claimant: ________________________________<br />Notary Public: ____________________________<br />*** Use of a Notary is for attestation and verification purposes only and does not constitute a change in status or entrance into or acceptance of foreign jurisdiction. <br /><br />

				Sovereign citizens are dumb shits. Dude just because you make some paperwork up with legal sounding terminology does not mean that it is real. I am all for people having rights and am highly libertarian and anarchistic, however I find it completely nonsensical thinking that made up paperwork is respected in the slightest bit by any government.

				I is not saying I am above the common law. If I do not breach the peace I have done nothing wrong. Goverments Acts and statues only need to be respected by your straw-man not you the flesh and bone human being creature of god. Nobody has the right to dictate how we life our lives because we are all equal.&nbsp; &nbsp;
