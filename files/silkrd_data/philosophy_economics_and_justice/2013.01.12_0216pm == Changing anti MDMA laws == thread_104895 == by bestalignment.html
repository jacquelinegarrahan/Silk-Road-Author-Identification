				I think the PTSD stuff is going to go a long ways towards making people appreciate that there is more than just recreational value to the substance. Like every other drug out there though, without a patent available to make someone rich it&#039;s nearly impossible, nay it is impossible, for a drug to get through the FDA.

				Get kilos of it in to every major water distribution plant on the planets water supply and watch world piece happen right in front of your eyes.<br /><br />Or &quot;easier&quot;, at something like G4 summit (or whatever they are called) get a good 150MG MDMA dose in to every major world leaders bottle of water, burst in room and talk about being thirsty, they will automatically drink (like when you yawn, so does the person looking at you) and then wait 40 minutes, burst back in and tell them what you have done, and then ask for it to be legalized.<br /><br />They will say, yes.. people always say yes when they are high.<br /><br />Of course, with most things - easier said than done.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				I think ecstasy will be legal in the form of medical mdma in the future to treat PTSD and other forms of therapy.&nbsp; It wont benefit us recreaional users much but hopefully you will just get a fine for possesion without a medical card.&nbsp; I can imagine now the dispenaries having a great selection of pills, crystals, and edibles supplied by legal super labs!

				I think a wave of weed decriminalization and legalization around the world will come first, over the next 10-20 years. This will hopefully lead to more pragmatic, evidence-based drug policies in some countries, which will lead to decriminalizing most drugs including MDMA. You probably know that this has been very successful in Portugal. That said, I think we are still quite a long way from seeing legal, regulated MDMA, apart from for medical use. It will happen eventually though, once us pill poppers get into office&nbsp; ;D

				Like try to get to the supreme court and say that mdma like weed is safe to use and the harm that comes from it is because of the laws against it funding crime, imprisoning users and in my opinion causing the health hazards associated with it.

				Honestly I think the real question is why have we all consented to being governed by a body politic that finds it within their right to tell us what we can put in or do with our own bodies? In the USA at least can you imagine someone trying to sell this system to the founding fathers?<br /><br />&quot;So you are proposing that armed soldiers will ambush me on the road to take my money for riding too fast and then demand that I submit to a search in hopes of finding other criminal acts because they feel it is suspicious that I have such a nice horse in such a bad part of the countryside? Further, you&#039;d like to tax me for the privilege of simply owning a horse and using the roads? And if I choose not to pay you are going to lock me up for years at a time in prisons paid for by those that do choose to consent to said accostations? And you would like me to describe this perpetual state of taxation for life as freedom? Nay fuck youith I think we will revolt some more for better terms.&quot;

Many drugs are valuable solely because they are illegal, and crime often results solely because of the high price of obtaining them. Addicted users cannot source the funds to purchase them without resorting to crime, whereas addicted uses are quite often able to do so when the substance is alcohol or tobacco. <br /><br />From that perspective, there would be a large number of drugs that would work better when legalized and available for a reasonable price, inclusive of VAT and such. <br /><br />Things that come to mind at first glance are cannabis, lsd, mdma, benzo&#039;s. If you objectively look at their harm and addtiction potential, i can see no reason why these substances should be banned in a society that accepts alcohol and tobacco as legal substances. Things like ephedrine and perhaps even amphetamine should also be considered in jurisdictions where caffeine is legally available in unlimited amounts.<br /><br />The problem is that science does not prevail in such political decisions. Tradition is often a reason to condone things: Alcohol as a legal drug for one, but things like salt and sugar would also miserably fail safety requirements for food additives. If current health and safety standards would be applied to everything, we would not legally have sugar, salt, coffee, cigarettes, booze or even pepper to grind over our meals.
