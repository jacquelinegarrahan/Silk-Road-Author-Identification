				So I&#039;m trying this idea out that I&#039;ve had for a while... not sure where this thread will go or how much interest there is, but I happen to be in a position to answer some legal questions in a very general sense (i.e., not specific to your state) for those who might have questions about legal myths, situations, etc.<br /><br />If this is something that people are interested in doing, I worry that there will be too many questions for me to get to.&nbsp; I expect I&#039;d be able to log in to answer questions once or twice a week, and I plan to just pick through and answer a few questions at random (providing there are too many to answer them all).<br /><br />First, I would urge every American citizen (or those who expect they may ever be in a position to assert an individual right in America) to watch these (clearnet) videos:<br /><br />Don&#039;t talk to cops, part 1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8z7NC5sgik<br />Don&#039;t talk to cops, part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08fZQWjDVKE&amp;feature=relmfu<br /><br />With all that said, I hope I can be of some help and potentially assist in dispelling some common myths surrounding drugs laws, search and seizure, etc.... Ask away...

				I have a simple one I think. If I have a prescription for lets say Oxycontin, I have a right to possess those pills and can&#039;t be prosecuted.<br /><br />How long does that protection last, does it ever expire? Do I now have a right to possess let&#039;s say, 90x40MG Oxycontin pills forever? <br /><br />If I keep refilling that bottle nobody is ever going to know I ran out a long time ago, etc.

				I have a question: <br /><br />A friend of mine might have impregnated a woman who was married to another man at the time. She broke up with her husband, then hooked up with another guy, who for some reason signed the birth certificate of the child. Does the father have any legal responsibility for the child? <br /><br />

				In the USA, I know its legal for companies to import generic versions of certain medications from India, if and only if they are licensed by the DEA. How legal is it for an individual to purchase medications from these companies either with, or without a prescription?

				If someone were to have their house raided and have less than 2 ounces of MDMA and got busted with possession and intent to sell, as well as possession, with no criminal history, is this person likely to go to jail or would they be more likely to get probation since its a first offense?

				Cool a lawyer thread, I always liked these classes in college... I got one for ya regarding HIPPA laws and patient privacy/rights<br /><br />Say 911 is called to someone&#039;s residence because someone is &quot;freaking out&quot; eg. panic attack (medical condition) on LSD etc.... once the paramedics have arrived and the person is deemed a &quot;patient&quot; shouldn&#039;t law enforcement have no right into the &quot;patient&#039;s&quot; confidential medical information (which is everything surrounding their condition during this situation). All this assuming there are no illegal substances left in the residence.<br /><br />It seems to me, and from my experience, that police have no right to enforce anything due to patient privacy laws - someone can be high on meth freaking out and the cops be in their house but once the medics arrive (in California) it seems as if the police usually just cut the person loose and don&#039;t even cite them - maybe this is county specific?<br /><br />What do you think - could a person sue the police for infringing on their patient confidentiality by arresting them after calling 911 and being treated for a medical emergency?<br /><br />Thanks for being here - very much appreciate a good lawyer in company

Sites for both of these things are on the same network, if for some reason they could see peoples unprotected data (other than FBI run exit nodes or the like) as it&#039;s sent to websites on Tor then they would be able to do the same for any other type of site on the network too they wouldn&#039;t just use it as a secret weapon against pedos. But who knows, maybe they do have such technology and they&#039;re just waiting to bust all of us at once.

				Yeah, I second the paranoia recommendation.&nbsp; I don&#039;t enjoy weed, personally, so honestly I don&#039;t even know how big a lump a half pound really is... but I&#039;d be really, REALLY careful about only ordering from a vendor who has really good reviews for large quantities.&nbsp; Remember, you&#039;re at more risk than the seller the way we do things here.&nbsp; Find somebody who either cares about their clients, or who understands that clients who get arrested do not come back to pay you more money (i.e. the most profits come from ensuring the safety of your buyers).

				Having something delivered to your home is not a crime unless they can show you knew what it was and were involved. Otherwise, your enemy could mail drugs to you and tip off the cops and they would bust you.<br /><br />Read the thread by the employee of usps. It states that unless the person signs for the package they can&#039;t even execute a search warrant. Signing does not prove you ordered it either but it is evidence which the jury could consider. I would not even take the package in right away, let it sit and cool a while. If someone comes asking questions, hand the package over and say you know nothing about it. Opening it and lying about it is evidence of guilty knowledge.

				I would like to ask , what are the limits (if any) on police entrapment of drug buyers in the US. For instance Ive heard that LE cant sell a buyer real drugs - without keeping control of those drugs and immediately trying to arrest the buyer. If for example somebody buys drugs here on SR repeatedly from the same seller and receives real drugs , and nobody shows up to arrest him, can this be taken as an assurance that the seller is not LE?&nbsp;
