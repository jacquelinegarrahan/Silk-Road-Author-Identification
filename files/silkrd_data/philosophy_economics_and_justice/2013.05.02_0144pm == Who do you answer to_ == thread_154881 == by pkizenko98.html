I don&#039;t think there is necessarily one. As Douglas Adams said:<br /><br />&quot;Anything that happens, happens. Anything that, in happening, causes something else to happen, causes something else to happen. Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, happens again. It doesn&#039;t necessarily do it in chronological order, though.&quot;<br /><br />Or as it is put in Illuminatus!:<br /><br />Why? Because.<br />Why anything? Because everything.<br />Why me?! Because something has to happen to you, schmuck...<br /><br />Basically, something has to happen, it might as well be ATP. If it wasn&#039;t ATP it would have to be something else and we&#039;d be having exactly the same conversation about that... If there wasn&#039;t, we wouldn&#039;t be here to talk about it...

But in all honesty I totally agree, who the hell on Earth knows whats right and whats wrong, I sure as hell don&#039;t, and i don&#039;t think any of my fellow humans know either. Life &amp; death are literally such funny things when you think about it. The entire way that all life (and non-living things) interact here on Earth are so funny ( Im sober btw) but truly I cant explain it more than that. <br /><br />I believe in a creator, but i also believe in evolution. <br /><br />I believe in a creator not because i think there is evidence but because it helps me cope with the fact that one day, (upon my death) I will be judged by the only being who knows the truth. Free from any hidden agendas and greedy humans that let money and power cloud their judgement. I apprehensively await judgement day, until then... LSD and SRF

Religions are great for most people and many of them can actually read between the lines cause it all leads to one no matter what you &quot;believe&quot; in. The way of this thinking is complex so for some its good to have like &quot;one creator&quot; and not have to think about and for some it isnt. What i was trying to say is that we as human kind feel exactly the same as we bleed the same and think about life itself wether you believe in religion or something else. <br />But we always try to explain it OUR ways. One of my best old Friends came from Lebanon and was a fullblooded muslim, but when we talked while being on opiods and good kush no matter what words he used we knew we believed in the same even i wont call it Allah or God and we Knew we know each other and always meet &quot;on the Road&quot;. Its inside of us, the flame some call God and some say we as a creation itself, nature, and the love in life is god. Believe what you want because its your very own movie, and tolerate other Humans even if you dont agree. We are all one.<br /><br />So its actually nice how humanity is going after so many tragic failures but thats the way we are. I wanted to say that extremism no matter what you believe or do is bad, either nazi or superkatholic or superesotheric with magic stones and shit. I think the balance is the key, like theres truth in all. But most in your own life, thats the main thing. But i believe in everybodys own thoughts cause theyre all truth. Love life instead of thinking about death. We all fell the magic. <br /><br />Pinkman
