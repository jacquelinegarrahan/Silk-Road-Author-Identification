				Hypothetically.<br />In a free society, if someone is engaging in behaviour you find repulsive, but is not infringing the perceived freedoms of you or anyone else, do you think you have the right to intervene and stop the behaviour?<br />Please discuss.

				Of course your neighbor has the right to kill his own puppies. Of course that also means he is extremely fucked up by western cultural standards, and you should probably refuse to trade with him or offer him any assistance at all if you wish to discourage his behavior. You have some cultural conditioning that has made you put dogs on a higher level than animals such as cows, however in many Asian countries dogs are routinely raised for slaughter, just as in your country it is quite likely that cows and chickens are raised for slaughter. If your neighbor is a farmer and raises cows because he enjoys killing them and eating them, do you think you have any right to stop him? How about pigs? Pigs are actually quite intelligent as far as non-human animals go, I have heard them compared to dogs in this regard although I am by no means an expert on animal cognition. In India they find it extremely offensive (and I believe it may even be illegal) to raise a cow for slaughter, in much of the western world we place dogs and cats on such a level, however in much of the oriental world they raise dogs and cats for slaughter just as westerners do pigs and cows. In a free society you can kill your cows, chickens, dogs and cats.

				Animals will cease to be property and gain rights of their own when they evolve to be capable of asserting their own rights. Some already have done this, like man-eating mountain lions. You are not morally responsible for your neighbor&#039;s behavior and if you condemn what he is doing to the puppies, you can try to convince him to stop, or simply excommunicate him from your life.

In a free world (I assume you mean a World without any written &quot;binding&quot; code of behavior, namely the Law) it depends on one part on the community where you are living and what they think it&#039;s an accurate behavior, (you will have to live in a community otherwise it&#039; will be hard providing you with all material and skills to survive on you own, if you can I guess no discussion needed). So, if you community decides you are a lunatic puppy killer and deserve to encounter the same fate, as the puppies you are definitely going down because there is now paper or somebody to enforce that non existent paper to protect you ass.<br /><br />Now to the second part; I think it depends also on the resources and skills you can provide to the community. So if puppy meat is the only or an easily available nutrition you have a certain amount of POWER over the rest of the community and even if some think it&#039;s bad,&nbsp; those are still dependable on you providing puppy meat, it means a fuck what those think cause they would starve over there own moral and ethnic thoughts. <br />To refer to the thought about the private security agency; For that those agents secure his property, he needs to provide them with something (puppy meat, security, butt fuck, weapons...) for that those people are going against the commune sense of their community not killing puppies (assuming it&#039;s in a western country where the majority is against dead puppies) and maybe slaughtering there own relatives, rising against the puppy breeder.<br /><br />So resuming all those thoughts, in my opinion it&#039;s all about who has the Power to control the resources and decides who get them.<br /><br />To the Barron: I think you approach on what a free society is, is a bit naive. Cause a &quot;society&quot; that goes after the motto &quot;I just care about my individual believes and freedom and won&#039;t interfering with those of others&quot; is just a loose bunch of individuals who are all gone die sooner or later; I want call it even a society, cause a society needs some common rules, values or believes for that individuals can interact in a civilized form with each other. It&#039;s has nothing to do with moral, just survival, cause there is no mechanism like Law or enforcement on that to protect you just a community you are stuck with.<br />This is just my opinion and how I like to say: &quot;Opinions are like assholes; every one has one and mostly there are no flowers coming out&quot;<br /><br />-Peace over-

				I chose &quot;No, they are his property, therefore he can do what he wants with them&quot;. Everyone who chose &quot;Yes you can stop him, his property rights do not extend to include abhorrent behaviour&quot; should instantly become a vegetarian who will try to stop pigs, cows etc from getting slaughtered or live with the fact that they have double standards.<br /><br />And yes, eating meat is for your own enjoyment.

I cut my finger real bad and I tell everyone to not use a keyboard as it opens up the cut again, yet I am typing these lines ;D&nbsp; <br /><br />I am on the same page as you are (also prefer kittens :P) but breading dogs just to kill them is plain animal cruelty. Claiming he &quot;shouldn&#039;t&quot; be stopped, because other animals suffer abuse as well is a bit like turning your back on the issue. Of course I can&#039;t safe all, but to me that wouldn&#039;t be a reason not to try/start somewhere.

				First, are the puppies owned property like a car, a house, etc. or do the puppies have rights similar to people?&nbsp; If they are just owned property, then owners of property should be able to do what they want with their stuff.&nbsp; If the puppies have rights like people but live at the property where the owner likes to kill puppies, then the puppies will have to figure out their environment isn&#039;t the best place to be and try to leave. What if they can&#039;t leave?&nbsp; Then they need to get together, come up with a battle plan, and attack and kill or be killed.&nbsp; There it is.<br />

				We know this isn&#039;t about puppies.&nbsp; Nice example though.&nbsp; Now if the puppy killer uses his freedom to kill the &#039;puppies&#039; but the puppies don&#039;t want to be killed, then the puppies freedom is being violated.&nbsp; The &#039;puppies&#039; have their choice too. Now in total anarchy the ones with the biggest guns, the most manpower, the most resources, will try to dominate those who have less and are not as powerful.&nbsp; Then they make rules they call laws, and mete out punishment if you don&#039;t listen to them, because they&#039;re in charge&nbsp; Even if their rules are unfair, they have the muscle to make things happen. So a type of government is formed.&nbsp; It would be nice for a truly free society to exist, but there aren&#039;t any.&nbsp; Then, once the anarchy turns into another government, there will be those who don&#039;t agree with the policies and form alliances and eventually overthrow what they don&#039;t like, then they&#039;re in charge.&nbsp; On and on it goes.&nbsp;

				I&#039;m a vegetarian. The Non-Aggression Principle states that one may not initiate coercion. That&#039;s what killing puppies is. To anybody who says &quot;oh thats different,&quot; is it? &quot;Oh that guy can put me in a cage because he has a badge; its different.&quot; Shouldn&#039;t it be applied everywhere? Puppy killer has his individual freedom which is fine. However, by killing the puppies, he is interfering with a living being (the puppy)&#039;s freedom.

				In a truly free society, people could put into their own bodies what they choose, and buy and sell what they choose.&nbsp; In a free society the government wouldn&#039;t try to indoctrinate the masses to their agenda, but truly educate so people can make informed decisions.&nbsp; Personal property would belong to the owners, not the government lending it out to use until people don&#039;t pay to use it anymore.(taxes)Its easy to see who&#039;s property it is when people don&#039;t pay their property taxes, even if everything else is paid off.&nbsp; The government is run by low life pontificating pea brain politicians.&nbsp;
