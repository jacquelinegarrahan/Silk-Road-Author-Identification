				What do you sense as the spirit/ driving presence behind each drug. Now I can only speak from my own personal experience but I find it a lot harder to sense the pattern and themes of a drug outside of psychs. I don&#039;t believe in an actual external spirit operating through the drug however I do use the term spirit in reference to ones internal reflection and analysis of the mindset they are in whilst on the said drug and the feelings that conjures up. This can I believe be personified into being given spirit like qualities. A clear example of this is &quot;Lady Salvia&quot;. I read a beautiful trip report about a man who once took DMT and Salvia at the same time and had both of the spirits fighting each other for control of his mind. Was fucking awesome.<br /><br />Anyway here is my list.<br /><br />Weed- A warm slow thoughtful father earth type figure. Peaceful yet insightful. Calm yet valuable.<br /><br />MDMA- A really cool Aunty type figure. Young, Beautiful and full of Love. She is Confident routinely destroying barriers and thought patterns yet a softer side exists. She can soothe you, relax you and love you.<br /><br />LSD- A Transient, Transcendant cosmic being. A being comprised of duality and unity at every level e.g. Electrons orbiting a nucleus - Moons orbiting a planet.<br /><br />Cocaine - A brash arrogant god in its prime. Lives for the moment and destroys all in its path.<br /><br />Mephedrone - Another &quot;young&quot; spirit. Very hyperactive and bouncy with claws that easily sink into you. It&#039;s a muddied spirit. Neither good nor bad it simply is.<br /><br />Salvia - A harsh unforgiving mistress who enlightens and nurtures only a select few.

				I was going to put DMT but I&#039;ve never personally done it. I have heard from friends who&#039;ve done it and even trip reports on the internet that it is often a very spiritual experience. Whether the spirit is the so called &quot;machine elves&quot; or something else entirely is unknown to me.

				Ok, let me give my try. This is roughly how I experienced them, in my (so far, very few) sessions i had<br /><br />Psilo shroom:&nbsp; A quirky vibrant alien boy flying up with his interdimensional spaceship into his stellar castles. Most of the times benevolent, but don&#039;t you dare insult him! In a&nbsp; humorous and pretty educated way he will choose the best route for a ride, sometimes he will listen to your traveling preferences and he will gently set down your abashed and illuminated self afterwards.<br /><br />MDMA : Serene Crystal Goddess, she&#039;ll whisper to you, teaching you a lot of things, if you are allowed into her sanctuary. Once you HAVE been welcomed, she&#039;ll dispel all shadows and can turn around even &quot;bad&quot; things to the positive. You will feel much in the right place and loved. But you can&#039;t fully trust her crystalline beauty, it is intoxicating in either meaning. She will bless you but she will bill you 2 days later.<br /><br />2C-B: A pop culture artist, Andy-Warhol-esque, presenting his artwork is colorful and flashy, everything looks bright rooms are full of artwork, and you are sort of forced to appreciate the whole exhibition. You will note an undercurrent which can show you hidden and shadowy things you never wanted to know about yourself. Don&#039;t expect to have any say on what you would like to see.<br /><br />LSD: Now this is a fairy that settles down on you and stays with you. You will meet her as a friend and she&#039;ll leave you as a friend. She sure can show you things, but you have to ask ! Most often your wishes get granted. Humorous, and she can cast dust before your eyes. Her smell will stay with you for a few days afterwards.

				Every drug i have tried and used a lot of seems to have a spirit related to it, one i&#039;m particularly familliar with is ketamine, i find the spirit takes on a feminine entity, she is very jealos and her chemical relations like mxe seem to twin her and i found with mxe she is in pain. this is just my experiences. <br /><br />DMT seems to be a collective energy that almost seems alien as like mushrooms which are related chemcally, i wonder if i would call them spirits or just entities or aliens. <br />It&#039;s not the actual physical chemical that seems to get me intoxicated i think they all work as catalysts that launch you into othe entities dimensions and energy fields<br /><br />Sorry i wish i could put my words together better, hope this makes some sense to some<br /><br />with love<br />Psych<br />

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The DXM spirit is a strange one.&nbsp; If you take it by itself, you can drink alcohol like a champ, handle yourself well, and ignore pain/hunger/desire.&nbsp; If you take it with a psychedelic, it can take you to space without a spacesuit, and leave you on an alien moon all night, while it scares up spaceghosts and lectures you constantly about the past civilizations which have long since been destroyed and rebuilt.&nbsp; DXM is like the Lizard Man with the Crystals in Land of The Lost, the great manipulator, living between dimensions.

Innocent and trusting, deeply empathic and giving. Untainted and healing.<br /><br />Weed I&#039;d peg not as some serious grandfatherly type, rather more like a Silly spazzy version of Gandalf. An old man, yes, but he&#039;s never let his years even slow him down. A fun-loving guy, a cool old guy, laughs easily, very easy-going and laid-back, lives in the moment, and always ready for a new adventure.<br /><br />As for Cocaine, I&#039;d say you had that pegged. A masculine fearless young man, powerful, brave, fearing nothing, taking what he wants without a second thought. Virile and in his prime, he strides confidently into any place, club, office or home, and demands submission.

				This is a fun conversation and it&#039;s interesting to kind of see the differences is the relationships people have to different drugs.&nbsp; I had a thought when reading through and just thought it was worth throwing in how subjective something like experiences on mood &amp; mind altering substances are.&nbsp; People&#039;s minds and bodies can be so wildly different from one another in the way they react to and produce stimuli (for example, some people can keel over if they take a peanut into their body).&nbsp; I&#039;ve been learning a bit about biochemistry and pharmacology here and there and it&#039;s fascinating how these compounds literally physically act as little molecular keys to slide into your bodies various receptors and either stimulate them in various ways or just block out your bodies endogenous &quot;drugs&quot; from interacting with said receptors for a period of time.&nbsp; I think Sasha Shulgin said it best when talking about an early experience on one phenethylamine or another, and I&#039;m paraphrasing:<br /><br />&quot;I looked and I couldn&#039;t imagine why in the world 100mg of this unassuming white, crystalline powder would have all of THAT in it.&nbsp; I realized that all of this &#039;stuff&#039; was coming from ME.&quot;&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If you&#039;re a fan of &quot;drugs&quot;, you def owe it to yourself to check out the documentary &quot;Dirty Pictures&quot; on Sasha and Anne Shulgin.&nbsp; It&#039;s free on youtube.
