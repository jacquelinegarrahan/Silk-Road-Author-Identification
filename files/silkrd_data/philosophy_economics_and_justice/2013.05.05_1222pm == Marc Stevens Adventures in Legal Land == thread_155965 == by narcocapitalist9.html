				It just occurred to me after some discussion about this in a chatroom that this might be rather pertinent and interesting to people here - Marc Stevens is an activist who regularly gets traffic tickets, IRS claims, and even sometimes drug charges thrown out of court. He is based in Arizona, and does private consultations both in person and with skype and sometimes attends courts to people&#039;s &#039;Mckenzie Friend&#039;.<br /><br />I was the mischief maker who originally converted and uploaded a pdf version which I spent a lot of hours fixing up the encrypted underlying text to bittorrent via thepiratebay, and I think someone else took that version and added the audiobook version, which can be found here:<br /><br />http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8339908/Adventures_in_Legal_Land_-_Marc_Stevens_%28organized_audiobook___e<br /><br />Marc is in the middle of promoting his new book, called &quot;Government Indicted&quot; and you can find Marc&#039;s website at http://marcstevens.net He runs a weekly radio show called &#039;The No State Project&#039; which is always informative and entertaining. <br /><br />I will warn people that he is a bit circumspect as regards to the subject of drugs and prohibition, but he&#039;s an anarchocapitalist, like all the best people (such as DPR) and in private he is probably more relaxed than when he is talking on his radio show. I highly recommend that everyone who is concerned about the possibility of getting attention from LE for their activities on SR, or who is in the middle of such trouble, to sit down and read this book (or listen to it, I haven&#039;t listened to it, I might have to download it so I can find out if he actually reads it himself, he&#039;s got a great cheesy long island accent that I find amusing to listen to).
