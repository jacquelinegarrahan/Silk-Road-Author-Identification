				Thanks for creating this poll! It&#039;ll be interesting to see why other members use this site. <br /><br />Personally I think that this place is great, secure and I enjoy the idea of participating in a global market that exists outside of the state and its regulators. Hopefully one day (soon) humanity (or at least a large number of us) will become more independent from the teat of the establishment, more aware of how fucked our planet is, and finally start to take ACTION to correct the path we are on.

Before I moved states I got quite involved in the &quot;market&quot; and the number one problem I ran into was the number of research chemicals that were being sold as the two ladies . As much as intersesting as I find the RCs I don&#039;t think that they are the safest substances for people as they cause very different &quot;feelings&quot;. You should KNOW what you have and sell it for what it is and not just try to increase your market.

				Love everything grey/black.....<br /><br />I am blessed with living in a place where you can get pretty much any drug you want in really good quality for a reasonable price, so I only use the road for the occasional recreational order for novelty purposes. I just like being part of this and contributing to a truly global market without boundaries and government meddling. <br /><br />Maybe over time we will have less &quot;huge vendor gone rogue&quot; situations and more reliable shipping time info, if that were the case, I would make it my main source despite paying premium.

				I use silkroad because i just enjoy new experiences, that&#039;s one of the reasons why i grow weed it&#039;s quite nice knowing you are not just a government brainwashed sheep, but an individual who has an opinion of his own. Most of the illegal drugs do not deserve their status and reputation. <br />Also its quite an attractive idea - get your drugs delivered right to your doorstep, with greater choice and control. Like it should be! <br />Silkroad, i hope, will help me to become a psychonaut :D something that I have been interested in for quite a long time, if i resolve this issue with my Pin.<br />So in a way I came here for spiritual education...

				I&#039;m here because I love the community. I love what the community has accomplished and I love what the community stands for. The drugs are great and of course are the driving factor behind the community, but I am talking more about the ideology that is behind this market, this force.&nbsp; This free market, the people it attracts, the conversation it generates … just the entire revolution (because it is indeed a revolution as others have said) fascinates me.&nbsp; <br /><br />As far as the drugs, I love being able to browse and find what buds really interests me.&nbsp; I’m happy to pay for that convenience.&nbsp; I’m happy to pay to not have to drive with weed in my car.&nbsp; If I still were into opiates really heavy, I’m sure I’d be happy I didn’t have to drive into west Baltimore or D.C. to get dope that is only half decent, deal with jump out and risk being around when shots ring out.&nbsp; I love that there is a guy like hatter26 who does so much to support harm reduction with the products he offers.&nbsp; &nbsp; I’m sure there are other examples of vendors doing the same as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;You get the idea, I could go on and on. <br /><br />Just in its entirety, SR amazes me and I am proud to be able to be a part of it. <br /><br /><br />

				The quality of the merchandise on SilkRoad is far superior to the quality I can acquire IRL, I generally find the vendors to be a lot more customer focused then the streets, being able to order whatever I want to from the comfort and safety of my own sofa is a breath of fresh air. Long live the SilkRoad revolution!&nbsp; :)

				I&#039;m here because I have never seen such a free and supportive environment.&nbsp; I feel like I&#039;m witness to something very special here.&nbsp; It&#039;s really lovely to have such a safe place to buy illegal items, and I understand that&#039;s the primary purpose of Silk Road, however, after perusing these forums, I&#039;m seeing some really exciting things here.&nbsp; DPR&#039;s book club is fomenting some of the best philosophical debate that can be found anywhere, Member Pine is teaching others how to use PGP, the list goes on.&nbsp; This community is as important to the cause of human rights as Wikileaks, and is rapidly growing more relevant, and I predict soon this community is going to be a more feared adversary of the state than Anonymous.&nbsp; In fact, it may be already.

				I&#039;m here because I lost my connection of 20+ years when I relocated to a different part of the country.&nbsp; IMO,&nbsp; buying on SR is a lot safer than transporting large quantities of weed on the interstate highway system in the U.S. and having to avoid certain states with mandatory minimum sentences &amp; where weed can get a person thrown in the slammer for life.&nbsp; Now that I&#039;m here, as others have said, I&#039;m staying for the revolution.&nbsp; Also love being part of such a diverse &amp; vibrant community.&nbsp; Love live SR, long live DPR and thanks to the admin folks who keep this marketplace alive&nbsp; :-*
