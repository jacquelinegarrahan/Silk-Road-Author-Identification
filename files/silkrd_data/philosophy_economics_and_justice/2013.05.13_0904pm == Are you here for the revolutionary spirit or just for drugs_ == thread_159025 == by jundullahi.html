				I came for the revolutionary way of getting drugs.<br /><br />Doing drugs is revolutionary: you broke the rules to try something new. In my book, you have taken the first step as a student of live--one of the most significant steps closer to enlightenment, a genuine curiosity for life.<br /><br />How do we break the mold, as they say? <br /><br />By being a little different, by trying new things, and accepting and overcoming new challenges. Silk Road has offered a technological challenge;--as a user, a modest obstacle--the marriage of cryptography and privacy are the most important tools for freedom in a tech-heavy society. If we are really going to send people off planet, then technology will only increase. Furthermore, if we are going to survive meteors, volcanoes, climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, monsoons, desertification, pollution, gamma ray bursts, solar storms, magnetic pole shifts, etc., then technology must advance, and with that advancement, so must we cherish our freedom and privacy by learning how to secure and sustain cryptographic techniques.<br /><br />Whether you came for the drugs or the revolution, SR and TOR are important steps to expanding the human potential.

If you would ask the Islamic scholars most will say its all forbidden. I have found that some scholar who I do respect have made misjudgments on some issues because off lack of real experience.&nbsp; <br />Expamle on some say lucid dreams are impossible because in Islam sleep is name the little death and when you are dead you cannot be awake. Yet people have lucid dreams. <br />Before I reverted to Islam I did drugs. Then stopped but years after still something was nagging me that something was left unfinished. So I decided to do some personal research on this subject. There is a supplication is Islam that when you need to make a decision you pray and say this supplication. And if its good for you it will happen and if its bad for you Allah will keep you away from it.<br />So I did it an went on with my personal research as amateur psychologist and I am doing a little bit of research of how in intoxicating some drugs are. Out side of the official Islamic scholar official circles.<br />On how intoxicating some drugs are. How much do the cloud the mind. Because khamr comes from the root<br />of Khamara with means to cover. That is why the hijaab is also called khimaar because it cover a woman.<br />And in the time of the Prophet the on drugs that there was was alcohol. <br />And there so situation when something forbidden might become allowed because of necessity or because the might be benefit. That is my research goal. When some thing might be beneficial and how to use then to get the most benefit. I do not do this for pleasure. I a remember the horrors I went through when I was addicted I would rather no do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Till now I have tried hasj and weed. And wound that does do cloud the mind to much and do not benefit much.<br />Well they did give me paranoia and some in sight in to what I was doing wrong. But after the first two or three times I knew it was wrong. <br /><br />Then I moved on to heroin. I did not cloud my judgment and on the contrary made me feel more understanding when reading the Quran in Arabic. Almost cried. And that is because heroin does not cloud the mind the way alcohol does. <br />This my opinion and I am no scholar dont take my words as official Islamic law.<br />Some drugs like coffee improve the awareness. <br />This a still a tricky subject because in the past some Sufi sect have used drugs to get closer to Allah. I do not promote Sufism in any way.<br /><br />PS I am in no way advocating the use of drugs<br /><br />I hope this answers you question if you have more please ask. <br /><br />I wish you all the best<br />and in the next life <br />true success

				i came here for the bitcoins, and the joining of like-minded people to have their own forum at last whereby our collective thoughts and opinions would be a guiding light for the deluded masses once they come and see what we discuss and how we are breaking down barriers that have kept us apart for millenia.<br /><br />There are more than enough retards here already though to indeed confuse and mislead any who stumble across the wrong threads.<br /><br />once we understand each other and ourselves proeprly we will be in a much better position to help others cast off their mental shackles and embrace sharing and consideration..<br /><br />the seperatist groups will be the most difficult to deal with as they thrive upon ignorance and confusion, keeping their members numb with repetative demands and commands whilst misinforming them of their counterparts in other seperatist groups.<br /><br />they refuse to listen to reason and repeat the ridiculous mantras they have been drilled into accepting<br /><br />the only choice we have is to wait for them to open their own eyes &amp; ears.<br /><br />any attempts to enlighten them will be met with fear, claims of ignorance &amp; tears of (they hate us) self-pity accompanied by &#039;righteous indignation&#039;<br /><br />et luta continua...

				agreed, Silk Road is a force to be reckoned with no doubt. A movement which sprung from the same roots as every other movement, we drug users are mistreated and criminalized. Second class citizens. The one thing that gives me hope is the intelligent and thoughtful threads that spring up from time to time. It is a helpful community, I am here to learn.

				Both I suppose. We&#039;re a community, through and through.<br /><br />But, I have some reason to fear nowadays. Maybe because we had so few vendors when the website was new but the off topic was always active, and I&#039;m coming to realize I&#039;m one of the older users still around, and there were THOUSANDS of people before me, yet maybe a dozen, not counting SR administrative staff, still around and posting. <br /><br />And some of you know more about security and the game than even I.<br /><br /><br />Where did we all go? Theres only a couple dozen active personalities on our entire forums now, and most are newcomers.

				The drugs are nice, and totally worth it. The revolution is in accordance with that similar belief. I chose to do drugs a long time ago, and in doing that I accept the risk of taking them. Even with the risk of using the mail, I would say that I reduce overall risk by using a product that, at least at the surface, is vetted by more than just the dealer telling me &quot;Yea this shit is the best!&quot; and accepting that the cake is a lie.<br /><br />I can spit out all kinds of beliefs I have towards drugs and the government oppression, but honestly I think that is the top of my list. I made a choice, and if I wasn&#039;t alright with that choice I&#039;d have stopped a long time ago. People wear armor, pads, helmets, etc for protection in their various risk choices... mine is choosing to seek out a better product than the mysterious stuff I throw judgement to the wind and try without a care in the world to what it probably is and what it isn&#039;t. SR isn&#039;t a 100% risk reduction in that area, but to a certain extent the community provides a far greater window of opportunity than the sketchy kid a hotel valet points you to when you&#039;re staring at limited options in the face&nbsp; :o

				I am of the revolutionary spirit, but I don&#039;t exactly go out and forment it. <br /><br />So, drugs. I won&#039;t claim I do it as a freedom fighter or spirit warrior, because though I agree with their causes, I ultimately am here for the economic utility it provides. With a full willingness to rise up when the time comes.

I could convinced about the truth about Islam with rational thought. That none is worthy of worship but the Creator. <br />Like I mention before Islam is a religion of reason.

				I feel like the real drug addicts and meth heads that just come here to get some cheap drugs don&#039;t even know there is a forum, and then the educated, smart and curious people will continue to venture through the deep web and find the forum. This is the first thing I check when I log onto my computer, I absolutely love the community on here. For me, the drugs are just a bonus, I love the fact that we have no clue about anyone on here, and that we just accept every type of person as we cannot truly know, that just makes the community great. And of course, drugs. ;D<br /><br />Locker.

				A little from column A, a little from column B. I&#039;ve known about SR for a year and I just now wanted to use it to get some rolls. Kind of wish I invested in BTC back then even if I didn&#039;t spend them on drugs. I&#039;m interested in what can be done with BTC, since this is some real Star Trek shit. I&#039;m learning a lot about how to keep my identity a secret online, and it also forced me to learn how to install a Linux distro.<br /><br />Some day we&#039;re all going to laugh about dealing with the mountain of bullshit that is the war on drugs, hiding on secret spaces on the Internet. All of us are veterans in an unjustified war that goes against the spirit of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

				We would be lying if we said Natural Highs was not started up to generate income, obviously part of our attraction to Silkroad is financial. That said, we believe strongly in personal freedom, why should governments dictate what substance a citizen can use to escape sobriety. One of Natural Highs main goals is to undermine Australian drug policy through distributing top notch marijuana.<br /><br />Viva la revolucion
