				So, there&#039;s an ex-LAPD officer and former Navy lieutenant with specialist/expert weapons and survival training who&#039;s gone rogue and devoted the remainder of his life to making the LAPD look like fools. Apparently they fired him in retaliation for an excessive force complaint he filed about another officer. Now he&#039;s got nothing left to lose and he&#039;s giving everybody the run-around. Apparently he&#039;s been planning this for a long time. <br /><br />First he allegedly killed the daughter (and her boyfriend) of a former Cal Poly Pomona police chief who Dorner said was responsible for losing his job, then subsequently defaulting on his mortgage, being discharged from the Navy, etc. Then he posted an 11,000-word manifesto online detailing corruption and bruality inside the LAPD, declaring war on the police, and also functioning effectively as a suicide note/goodbye letter. He also mailed a package to CNN&#039;s Anderson Cooper containing a DVD with witness testimony about the excessive force complaint, a note, and an &quot;LAPD Challenge Coin&quot; which had been shot 3 times in the air with a pistol. He wrote on the coin &quot;1 M.O.A.&quot; meaning 1 minute of angle/arc, a marksmanship term referring to being accurate enough to hit a 1 inch target at 100 yards. <br /><br />Then on Thursday, just hours after being identified as a suspect in the previous homicides, he shoots one cop in Corona and uses a rifle to ambush two more cops in Riverside. And now the LAPD is just scared shitless looking everywhere for this guy and they keep fucking up horrendously. On Thursday a couple LAPD officers shot up a blue Toyota Tundra (they were looking for a gray Nissan Titan) and injured two Asian women who were delivering newspapers. A third person who filmed the shooting is also said to have been shot. The burnt chassis of Dorner&#039;s truck was found with a broken axle in the mountains. And other than that he seems to have disappeared for now.<br /><br />&quot;I have always been the top shot, highest score, an expert in rifle qualifications in every unit I’ve been in. I will utilize every bit of small arms training, demolition, ordnance, and survival training I’ve been given.<br />&nbsp;<br />Do you know why we are unsuccessful in asymmetrical and guerrilla warfare in CENTCOM theatre of operations? I’ll tell you. It’s not the inefficiency of our combatant commanders, planning, readiness or training of troops. Much like the Vietnam war, ACM, AAF, foreign fighters, Jihadist, and JAM have nothing to lose. They embrace death as it is a way of life. I simply don’t fear it. I am the walking exigent circumstance you created.&quot;<br /><br />Honestly, I wish I could join him. And I have a feeling I&#039;m not alone in that sentiment.<br /><br />&quot;The culture of LAPD versus the community and honest/good officers needs to and will change. I am here to correct and calibrate your morale compasses to true north.&quot;<br /><br />Thoughts?

				I had a look at his manifesto, it was quite interesting, going back to the Rodney King riots. It certainly wasn&#039;t the ramblings of a madman as is portrayed by the media. I would call it coherent.<br /><br />LAPD has announced a new **investigation** into Dorner&#039;s dismissal. ??? Who polices the police?<br /><br />Shooting people in a car that &#039;looked similar&#039; to Dorner&#039;s is beyond belief. Some serious findings should come out of this with regard to LAPD&#039;s conduct over the years, but I suspect Dorner will be killed eventually and his memory will be resigned to history as a lunatic.<br /><br />The chances of the authorities actually accepting responsibility for anything that has happened in the past.../// Ha! I don&#039;t even need to finish that sentence.<br /><br />Any truth will be obfuscated by ample supplies of bullshit. It&#039;s the glue that binds us.

				So ... let me get this.<br /><br />A bloke has a problem in his workplace. He puts in a complaint and it is not dealt with in a way he believes is appropriate.<br /><br />So, the guy writes a 11000 word manifesto and vows to shoot down anyone connected with the incident which extends to their immediate family ...<br /><br />Assessment - this guys is fucked in the head and needs psychiatric help.

I have read parts of his &quot;manifesto&quot;, and I agree that they aren&#039;t a madman&#039;s ramblings, but certainly that of a mad (angry) man. I don&#039;t want to side with him, but I am more sympathetic than I want to admit... Wish he hadn;t killed the girl &amp; her boyfriend as they didn&#039;t have anything to do with his firing, or whatever exactly happened in his past.

				Several interesting dynamics at work here. On the one hand you have a Black criminal exhibiting typical negro behaviour. Everyone else is responsible for his problem --in this case his former employer, da man, White Debilz, whatever. If he were still living in Africa he would be blaming the enemy tribe, bad juju, tainted jenkum, penis snatching goat demons or all of the above.<br /><br />Then there is the Post-America, Jack Booted Thug reaction from &quot;the State&quot;. <br /><br />I don&#039;t condone his killing of that cop&#039;s daughter and her fiance.&nbsp; It&#039;s not right to kill people just because they&#039;re related to dirtbags.<br /><br />The guy supports gun control, Macaque Obama and Piers Morgan.&nbsp; From Christopher Dorner’s manifesto:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Anti-NRA:<br /><br />Wayne LaPierre, President of the NRA, you’re a vile and inhumane piece of shit. You never even showed 30 seconds of empathy for the children, teachers, and families of Sandy Hook.<br /><br />Loves Piers Morgan:<br /><br />…give Piers Morgan an indefinite resident alien and Visa card. Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws.<br /><br />The killer is also a huge Obama supporter and fan of gun-control.<br /><br />Loves Obama:<br /><br />You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents. You never questioned the fact that his former opponent, the honorable Senator John McCain, was not born in the CONUS or that Bush had a C average in his undergrad. Electoral Candidates children (Romney) state they want to punch the president in the face during debates with no formal repercussions. No one even questioned the fact that the son just made a criminal threat toward the President. You call his wife a Wookie. Off the record, I love your new bangs, Mrs. Obama.<br /><br />Pro Gun Control:<br /><br />Who in there right mind needs a fucking silencer!!! who needs a freaking SBR AR15? No one. No more Virginia Tech, Columbine HS, Wisconsin temple, Aurora theatre, Portland malls, Tucson rally, Newtown Sandy Hook. Whether by executive order or thru a bi-partisan congress an assault weapons ban needs to be re-instituted. Period!!!<br /><br />Mia Farrow said it best. “Gun control is no longer debatable, it’s not a conversation, its a moral mandate.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This shit is great propaganda.<br /><br />It totally destroys the jew meme of the angry white male.<br /><br />How will they deal with a liberal, angry, black, gun-nut, cop-killer?<br /><br />I don&#039;t know what I like better... negro cop killing zogbots or over-reactive zogbots killing everything in sight.

				Keep the family/relatives out of it... Other than that, fire away is what I would tell him!<br /><br />When I read his manifesto then seen the news, I instantly thought of Jason Bourne! He might single handedly take the LAPD down...<br /><br />If they catch him, he&#039;s done. He&#039;s not walking out alive.

				The U.S. just used this as an excuse to use drones on American soil. This isn&#039;t the way I wanted it to head, but at least someone finally rose the fuck up. What&#039;s more is, two LAPD cops shot at two women in a blue truck because they thought he was inside it. I&#039;m routing for Chocolate Rambo but this might take a turn for the worse unless everyone rises up... which they won&#039;t because there&#039;ll be a war to distract them once again. As much as I hate Marxism, old Karl was right about nationalism being stupid.

I see what you did there. Only one thing you&#039;ve forgotten - this &quot;workplace&quot; you&#039;re talking about is the Los Angeles Police Department. And this man&#039;s job, before now, was killing people and getting paid. He was a state-sanctioned murderer, formerly in the Navy Reserves. Deployment to Bahrain in 06. We&#039;re not talking about Joe Schmoe working at an entry-level desk clerk position who&#039;s getting sexually harassed and nobody gives a shit. The complaint was about a schizophrenic homeless man who was kicked in the face by a cop for literally no reason. I&#039;m sure Dorner was morally conflicted about filing the complaint, but I don&#039;t think he expected to be retaliated against for it, to the extent that he lost his home and was discharged from the Navy, effectively ending any career he had until that point. For many men, their life is a career of service. To be stripped of that is to be nothing, no one.<br /><br />The way I put this to a friend of mine is that when I approach this situation and think about it, I can&#039;t think about it the way I normally would, because I&#039;m just some fucking guy. My life experience doesn&#039;t even begin to cover any of this shit. I&#039;ve never killed anyone. I am never going to be in the situation that Dorner is in. And so I can&#039;t think about his actions in a vacuum - I can&#039;t think about them outside of the context of his life, his career, his trials and tribulations. When I think about what he&#039;s done, and why he&#039;s done it, I have to think about it the way that he would. And when I do, it makes a fucking ton of sense. Nothing rambling or incoherent about it.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=119878.msg813422#msg813422">Quote from: AlistairCook on February 11, 2013, 12:46 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Assessment - this guys is fucked in the head and needs psychiatric help.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />My assessment of your assessment is that your assessment is based on either incomplete data or a flawed understanding of the circumstances. It&#039;s open for debate though.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Link me to where you have read the &#039;full story&#039; and I will read. As a general principle my opinion is that the solution to any problm is not going rogue and killing people. If anyone thinks it is they need psychiatric help.

What doesnt happen a lot is someone snapping, grabbing a gun and killing anyone they can think of. The point of the rule of law is to stop the &#039;war of all against all&#039;. Without the rule of law there is nothing.&nbsp; <br /><br />You say you cant think about his actions in a vacuum? Well why is killing people who are essentially innocent a vacuum. No FUCKIN WAY is that a vacuum anymore than any violent crime against innocent people. This guy is whacko. He&#039;s had some bad shit happen to him and he&#039;s flipped the fuck out. End of story. You might understand it but you can not justify it.&nbsp; I hate cops as much as the next drug addled freak but I am not about to go an gun them down. Thankfully my country has sensible laws relating to the possession of firearms. <br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />

				Apparently they are using drones to locate him now which shows just how corrupt they are.<br /><br />They don&#039;t use drones to catch your regular murderer, offer million dollar rewards or set up protection for 50 families.<br /><br />Just shows how they feel a cops life is more important or valuable than any other citizen in america.

				This dude is a total hero in my book. Fuck the police, I hope he takes out as many of the bastards as he can. I feel slightly bad that he killed family members, I certainly would not condone that, but at the end of the day the pig whose daughter he killed stands for a system that results in other peoples daughters being killed.I have absolutely no pity for the police and I hope they take the massive support shown for this cop to be a fucking sign. I am amazed at how openly so many people in USA are rooting for this guy despite the fact that he is killing cops.

				So far, I&#039;m watching CNN and reading various news sources via google.&nbsp; Nothing new yet.&nbsp; How, by the way, did a plastic license survive that fire?!<br /><br />Do we think Dorner really went down in this fight, or do we think he may have escaped?&nbsp; It&#039;s still difficult to imagine he would&#039;ve let himself get essentially trapped in a cabin like that - I mean, with all of his knowledge and training, you&#039;d think he&#039;d know to avoid putting himself in a situation like that.&nbsp; Then again, maybe he didn&#039;t plan as well as he had hoped.<br /><br />Now people on CNN are saying that the support Dorner is receiving in social media is due to &quot;social media weirdness&quot; and comparing his supporters to supporters of random rapists and serial killers.&nbsp; :\

				Hooray for dead cops!<br /><br />Funny to see a cop killing cops.&nbsp; The pigs still went out and shot the shit out of workers though, they just don&#039;t know how to do anything else.<br /><br />Oddest part about this is that someone actually joined the police not knowing they were fascist, racist, reactionary cowards.&nbsp; How is such a thing possible?

				I just want to say I don&#039;t agree with what he did but I can understand why he did it. When everything has been taken from you and no one will listen to your pleas of innocence and corruption what can you do. Disappear like everyone else or make a change yourself. He was clearly crazy but the fact he had the entire nation talking about LAPD corruption is worth something, isn&#039;t it? I loved how while this was going on I listened to an entire hour on CNN of them covering this story and not ONE mention of LAPD corruption, which was the entire reason this happened in the first place. If it weren&#039;t for him killing that guy&#039;s daughter who had nothing to do with anything I would 100% be on his side. But seeing as how he did do that he&#039;s obviously crazy and I can&#039;t support that. As soon as I heard them say they heard a single gunshot in the house i knew how the story was going to end. Oh and also does anyone else find it to be cruel and unusual to burn a human being alive? I know it was cool in the 1600&#039;s and all, but they were witches not cop-killers soooo I don&#039;t know if poeple are still cool with that these days.
