				I don&#039;t know if there is an organized group per se. But I do thing we are moving towards world government.&nbsp; I think there are factions that want control of it (Zionist, Neocons, libs, etc.) and thus I believe it is a lot more fractured than we think. But all in all, yes, regardless of how, we are moving that way, for both better and worse.

				illuminati is a spirit archetype which extend beyond our 4d reality.&nbsp; a good amount of the &#039;alleged&#039; research into the subject is misguided, fanatical, and egotistical.&nbsp; I usually stay away from talking about the illuminati with most, simply because most don&#039;t take the time to research any deeper than a few videos. You must touch base on works of men like eric john phelps and fritz springmeir.

				Iv been studying on the Illuminati as well as the Freemasons for several years now. My grandfather was a Freemasons, 32 degree Scottish rite an Gran mother was a Eastern star(O.E.S) So growing up i always heard interesting stories they would talk about. <br /><br />I always thought the break down on the back of the dollar bill was pretty amazing. They say the President who Opreved the seal was somehow tied into the Illuminati, <br /><br />Almost all the USA presidents have been Freemasons except Bush an clinton, Their Skull n bones. Seems like the whole world was built up on some type of secret society an is still run by them . <br /><br />

The Illuminati Were Freethinkers, they believed in science an Logic an during those times it was all about The Vatican an Churches, so them trying to Explain things By science the Church an religions didnt take very well to them. <br /><br />Illuminati is suppose to&nbsp; mean &#039;The Enlighten ones&quot; It was started supposedly for Men who thought diffrent but knew they durcing those times could not speak out in the open about certain beliefs. It wasn&#039;t a good idea to go against the church back then. <br /><br />The Freemasons are rumored to be just the Knights Templar, The Templar&#039;s were Burned at the steak for supposedly worshiping Lucifer, The Vatican made that happen. But its rumored The ones that got away decided to keep their thing going an thats when they made the Freemasons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also What allot of people dont realize is, Many Freemasons will say &quot;Yes we worship lucifer&quot; But their meaning is not what most would think, Lucifer in latin mean Light=enlightenment so they are speaking as yes we believe in an study lucifer, its enlightenment.&nbsp; <br /><br />I could go on an on .. lol

It is called &#039;Confessions of an Economic Hitman&#039;. The book explains how the American Government are trying to achieve Worldwide power and the best part is, it comes straight from the horses mouth. The author of the book played a large part in burdening other countries with debt to the US that they could never repay, and thus, became slaves to the US, so to speak. It is a really interesting book ;)

Thats the first time i ever read the Templar&nbsp; Knights/Knights Templar be refer d to as Poor knights. They were anything But poor. Rumor is they dug under King Solomon s temple for 7 years an found a HUGE Amount of treasure. It help put them into power , One of the reasons they were slandered by the church is the church/Pope owed them money and instead of paying them made up the rumors that they were devil worshipers etc. Most were killed but the ones that went underground re made themselves and a new Society = The Freemasons .<br /><br />Every Lodge if you notice the Inside, the Floors &amp; Pillars , It is a replication of the inside of King Solomons&nbsp; Temple. One of the Famous Story&#039;s is about the Freemason named Hiram Abiff that was working for King Solomon he was the chief architect of King Solomon&#039;s Temple He was a Master Mason (3rd degree) 3 people tried to get him to give up the Master secret Password, an they failed so they killed him. When you become a Freemason an you get to a certain degree, The Re enactment is done about the story its suppose to show that that the story is a lesson in fidelity to one&#039;s word, and in the brevity of life.<br /><br />Also Ralph i agree with you allot about what you said with the bible. I feel it is a tool for manipulation an to instill fear an Mass Manipulation . From all my studys an lessons over the years iv come to the conclusion that the bible we know was not Christs teachings. It was writtin by man an to his own understandings, so thats when confusion set in. Half of the Holidays spoke about in the Bible are Pagan rituals really. <br />

				O I was wrong in some of my info i wrote in one of the above Posts, The Knights Templar were not in trouble with the church, It was a french king i forget his name, but he is the one that made the order&#039;s for them to be rounded up. My uncle and I were sitting down drinking a well aged glass of scotch in his den an i brought it up, Him being a Freemason (Master Freemason) He will tell me some stories. Of course if you wanna be a true light seaker an a light bearer you have to ask one to be one. <br /><br />Iv got all Intentions in the next year to get in touch with the Local lodge my family goes to and petition to become one, Some times you have to wait til the summer time is over though because they go dark until close to Nov , Dec.<br /><br />Anybody else ever thought of or wanted to be a Freemasons? If so why?

				I think i may have to do 1 of my 25C nboms and think about this more deeply. Iv never doe LSD or acid, I love shrooms but just have yet to have any in a while, Iv heard of some great EYE opening with this type of stuff when you go on a good trip, Do you think a Nbomb could make me achieve something similar? <br /><br /><br />Iv noticed how their is soo much bad stuff blamed on the Freemasons, But if it wasnt for more than Half of them that were part of signing the freedom of the USA from being under a Kings leadership, Things would be soo much different today.<br /><br />Another thing, IMO people are always saying A NEW WORLD ORDER IS COMING ETC ETC BLAH BLAH. But in my eyes, AMERICA was the NEW WORLD, It was indeed built up around Men who were in fact Freemaons, So its not that a NEW WORLD ORDER IS COMING, ITS ALREADY HERE! Do we not refer to the USA as the New world?<br /><br />We all know its un true about Christopher Columbus discovering America but i guess he just happen to be the first to get it in paper. I feel very deeply that people Read into the society to much, an start connection dots that really were never meant of anything. <br /><br />Just like if you have the #7 in your head an thats all your thinking about, Your bound to find that # occur more than usual simply because its in the back of your head, You sub and un sub contagiously looking for symbols, numbers etc. This is IMO. Iv taken Psychology an adavanced Psychology an it does state what i just wrote about once a # or letter or even a symbol is iimplanted in your thoughts, its gonna appear more to you, cause even with out you realizing you are looking for it..<br /><br />Does anyone Agree or Disagree? <br /><br />P.S. THIS THREAD IS NOT JUST BOUT THE ILLUMINATI, IT CAN BE OTHER SECRET SOCIETY OR JUST REALLY MYSTICAL THINGS.

Perhaps our role would be military for example...but no, I would not say that this is quite &quot;It&quot; yet. I think the main reason the US is so dominant has been our strategic location and having never been invaded while Europe ravaged themselves apart over and over. I do not think that we are a superior society though, in terms of average intelligence etc.<br /><br />I do think they would help immensely! I have not knowingly done nBomb to the best of my knowledge, my only experience in my life was from FUCKINGace&nbsp; ;D and I suspect that what I did was LSD even though many members said otherwise. To me, LSD was more of a way to understand different layers of reality. There was a few +4 disassociate moments where I was out of body and perceived humans as slowly vibrating, humming energy sources drawn to like energy. I do not think this would be optimal for what you are discussing but I am not an expert. Mushrooms are an excellent opportunity for this! It&#039;s precisely what I did last night actually, lol, after skimming this thread. I watched a few docs etc and reflected on a lot of the material at hand here and saw that there clearly some very powerful forces manipulating the very fabric of our environment and stealing our energies...perhaps even more powerful than the groups we are discussing (Tri Lat, Bild, COFR, IMF, etc) I even looked into some of Icke&#039;s stuff and found it quite fascinating especially under the influence of drugs. Since I am well aware that reality exists at layers beyond what language can encompass, or we are necc. aware of....I don&#039;t think he is necc. a looney tune!<br /><br />In regard to your point about the Free Masons being revolutionaries, well, I would just point out that revolutionaries are often (if not always) closet aristocrats that will simply turn into the abyss in which they stare :D They say that rebels make the greatest administrators....What I am trying to say is that ultimately, each and every human being is governed by self interest, to my knowledge, and we can parade around as whatever we like in the name of enlightenment, but at the end of the day it likely boils down to power and money, right?<br /><br />As for the pattern bias, you are certainly right and I catch myself doing it in ego centric moments quite often, lol. Nonetheless, we must not discount those patterns, for it is by recognizing them outside of typical frameworks of understanding etc that we gain advancement, and such is God, I think, to an extent....to create. To create is to go beyond......<br /><br />What I was exploring during the trip was eugenics type material in reference to the Jewish/German conflict in WW2 along with other conflicts as well. I think that civilizations ultimately drive the process, based on racial superiority in terms of functioning in said systems...but they are likely only accessories to much greater powers holding the reigns.<br /><br />wow that was quite the ramble :D<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That was a very interesting read bro. I enjoyed it from start to finish. i FEEL its always good to speak in depth on such subjects to really get the wheels turning in our brain an exercise that muscle. Just think of what we could/ARE capable of if we just had the Know how to use more of our brain power than atm we have access to. I almost feel that somehow we were fixed to only use a portion of our brain ,simply cause if we could indeed use it all, I dont know maybe we would go INSANE? MADE? NUTS? Just like on a Motor cycle they have something called a Govaner on it to keep it from going its full speed, but of course if you tweak it an change it you then have FULL SPEED! I feel our brains have been set like that. BTW this is off subject of the thread in a way but your Post made me think of all this.<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna have to get some Mushroom caps an go onto a Journey of the mind. The few times i did shrooms as a young teen, I was no where near ready to take on such thoughts an wonders as i have now in my later 20&#039;s/ Back then it was just fun to see weird shit when you closed your eyes or bright colors. <br /><br />Iv never done LSD, Iv had it from a lotto on SR i won, but never took it, I sent it to someone else. Iv always wanted to go on a LSD trip but i always feel like its gonna end up bad, And then if it does i have to ride it out for hours on hours.&nbsp; I dont know if a 25C NBOMB would be a good RC to use for what id be trying to achieve like what you an others have spoken off .<br /><br /><br />Also Can some one that has had a LSD EGO break tell me what that means? or what happens?

				Thats really deep stuff. Thats the kinda thing i could really enjoy an also sounds extremely enlightening an now that im older thats what im all about.<br /><br />Enlightenment<br />Purpose everything that comes with those things. When i was younger i never thought nor cared about that type of deep thought. Iv almost become addicted to Enlightening my self of everything i can these days. I love the Mysteries of the world there is just so much un answered stuff out there, and if LSD can bring some type of my own clarity then im all for it.<br /><br />I guess when someone has a trip like that the way you spoke of, its all different for everyone, More on the lines of everyone comes to their own conclusion, but No one is wrong in what understanding their own self has come to. <br /><br />Very interesting thought. Thanks for that bro.

				guys.... i just checked the project i started. and i think its working. phase one is in action.<br />The Illuminati started with a large supply of gold. They built the modern&nbsp; banking system. I have found a way to fuck it up properly. a new software is being developed that might change the world. based on bitcoin. NO MORE BANKS!<br />Phase 2 is about the future of food. and addiction. Ill keep you guys updated.<br /><br />Oh my god. its all coming back. my consciousness started expanding again. I was afraid i might go mad. but i dont. Im just more aware. I see everything.<br />see? this is why acidheads either become millionaires or lunatics. Play it or get lost and die alone.<br /><br />Mind expansion is serious business. There are reasons to do it and there are reasons to hold back. I will forever be sad. because i see. ignorance is bliss. People who want happiness should not seek out heavy psychedelics. it will open your mind. it will open your heart. new dimensions. elves. but its like the matrix. and people who wake up can never go back. food will never taste the same. the air will never be as fresh, love will never be as pure. but your eyes will be open. WIDE<br /><br />sheet. im really fuckin high. I have never been so high

So I think its more healthy and more imaginative.<br /><br />I think Acid does significant damage to your brain, after continues usage. <br />I know gentleman, who have done large amount of Acid in the 70&#039;s, and are now Loonatics for sure&nbsp; :o.<br /><br />All the people who are reading/discussing this topic, need to re stock on DMT.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />
