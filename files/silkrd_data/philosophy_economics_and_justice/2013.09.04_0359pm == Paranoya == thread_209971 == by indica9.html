				i was thinking about the paranoya the weed gives u recently, and the question is <br /><br />is the weed is making the paranoid or is the system which was controlling us all these years makes us paranoid?? so the problem really lays on the weed or the governmental system?? <br /><br />i read lot of about people describing on increased paranoya levels due to high weed use or any other dug in that case, but all we learned and the way we&nbsp; behave or act if u think deeply is a result of everything what we learned thru out our life , the system which always say whats right and wrong ( i read a good article on why we will not win the war on drugs, much loved) for their own benefit to keep the corruption running which makes us slaves on the system from the day we see the world changing and adopting us to to be a part of corruption and slowly sinking the piles of concrete of systematical slavery on to our mind and without a ur knowing that illusion becomes a reality and stays hard in ur brain so u judge what u do and u think drugs are wrong, so the same impact fucks up on u and paranoid takes u over when ur on drus coz to ur mind they have implemented what ur doing is wrong, bullshit<br /><br />anyways so are we to blame the weed/drugs or the system for the paranoya when ur on them??<br />

				... damn, man.&nbsp; Now _that_ is some fucked up drug induced logic, right there.&nbsp; Enjoy bro :P<br /><br /><br />Oh.&nbsp; Wait... no, never mind.&nbsp; I thought you were saying something different.&nbsp; That&#039;s not the kind of paranoid weed makes me.&nbsp; Not at all, actually.&nbsp; It&#039;s a self conscious, &quot;everybody hates me, they think I&#039;m a nerd -- shh, don&#039;t speak, you can only make it worse!&quot; kind of thing that I can&#039;t get a grip on.&nbsp; So... no, I don&#039;t believe the system is responsible for that kind of paranoia... :)

				A few months ago some people called me paranoid for thinking that the government was sniffing tens of millions of e-mail a day and archiving them in a massive database for later use. Others called me fucking crazy.<br /><br />It&#039;s not the drugs. It&#039;s the world we&#039;re living in. The real world. The people who stick their heads in the sand pretending it doesn&#039;t exist are the ones who are fucking crazy.

				Very interesting thread and this is something I have been thinking a lot.<br /><br />I am a cannabis user more or less 7 years. I used to be very fanatic about weed and really a big fan.<br />The last 2-3 years I found myself smoking everyday at least 2-3 small joints. I can&#039;t handle more or I don&#039;t need more. The last 2 months though things has changed. I stopped the daily usage and I have noticed how much better I enjoy smoking one or two times per week.&nbsp; I can say I got tired of smoking everyday and had to change it. And I believe this is a better and more respectful approach for cannabis.<br /><br />As for paranoia... I don&#039;t really know.. Some say that if you smoke it in large doses, daily and for a long time you develop some kind of paranoia. From my own experience and surroundings I have seen people who used a LOT in their past developed some strange fears and conspiracy theories that even though they maybe be true in a certain level, they don&#039;t deserve so much focus and worries. <br /><br />To be more specific, 3 people I know have completely lost it. Yes they have smoked really a lot in their lives and now this is what they do.<br /><br />The first guy, thinks all the time that the police and the government is after him (even though he doesn&#039;t do anything beside smoking weed) and he is really obsessed with his privacy and anonymity. We can&#039;t even go for a coffee outside and talk because he believes that &quot;they&quot; have planted&nbsp; bugs to record his discussions. He used to be so clever and all of the sudden he is doomed in his own world....<br /><br />The other guy is even worst... The last year he has been obsessed that everything comes from Greece, the DNA of the Greeks is the most powerful (!!), all the global system wants to destroy the Greeks and so on. You can&#039;t talk to him more that 5 minutes before he starts &quot;ow did you know that the Greeks invented this&quot; and sooo much more. I mean that&#039;s is terrible. He sits on his computer, smoking his weed and reading all the stupidest blogs around the net... Sadly he is now at a social point where he doesn&#039;t have anyone to hear his &quot;theories&quot;.<br /><br />The 3rd has some obsessions as well but I will not tell anything since he is still a good friend. <br /><br />In the bottom line, I can say that long term usage with combination of large doses can lead to some paranoia. Like everything in life, moderation is a important key! Again moderation is above all!<br />Even this magnificent therapeutic plant can be dangerous if we don&#039;t respect it and misuse it..<br /><br />Lastly, yes, our freaking system has a huge impact on our lives and psychology but on the other hand it is we who are responsible for our own physical and mental health. Smoke weed because you want to enjoy one or two free hours you have, smoke it when you want to get some inspiration or whatever. Don&#039;t do it because you are used to or because you don&#039;t have anything else to do...<br /><br />All the best my friends<br /><br />Adamiz

				Not a single grammar-nazi mentioning the title. ;D<br /><br />I&#039;m smoking for about 9 years now and I very rarely had cannabis induced paranoia in all those years. There where two occasions where I really had to lay down in my bed and try to relax myself because I was really paranoid. Also the last one year of &quot;streetweed&quot; where not so good, the product was &quot;highly psychological&quot; I would say. Mindfuck. Since I&#039;m smoking the quality products from here I don&#039;t get introverted that much anymore even tho the effect is much stronger.<br />I would do anything to not have to buy the street bullshit anymore. High or stoned, or both. Who want&#039;s to have a huge mindfuck when smoking? :-)<br /><br />What is more common is anxiety if I smoke really huge amounts.<br /><br />I would advice to do regular breaks ranging from at least 2-3 weeks to 1-2 months after smoking daily for a while, not only you&#039;ll enjoy cannabis so much more, but you&#039;ll need tiny amounts of material to get where you want to be.
