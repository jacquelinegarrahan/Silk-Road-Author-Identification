				See bottom for tl;dr version.<br /><br />Since I&#039;ve come to feel that old members of the SR community fall on the outskirts of who I consider &quot;my own,&quot; I decided the incredibly small loss to myself from sharing this info is worth making sure all of you can make your own informed decision.&nbsp; Yes-yes, I&#039;m aware I&#039;ve only been around a few months, but the statement stands.<br /><br />Today Wordpress.com started accepting payments in BTC.&nbsp; Not only that, apparently their checkout page has the price in BTC next to the price in USD (I have not verified this, but it&#039;s what some article somewhere said).&nbsp; This means that a lot of people who pay money to Wordpress are going to stop and wonder, &quot;wtf is that?&quot;&nbsp; Some of those in turn will look it up.&nbsp; They don&#039;t even have to use it or really care.&nbsp; They&#039;ll know about it, some bring it up, &quot;there&#039;s this crazy thing I saw...&quot; -- you know how it goes. The initial exposure of people like me retweeting and reblogging and reposting adds to that; the comments for the initial wordpress release make that clear.<br /><br />Adoption of Bitcoin as a standard currency is where its long term value will come from -- if it doesn&#039;t fade into nothingness.&nbsp; But people are emotional and markets have spikes.&nbsp; There may be a big fucking spike in the next days or weeks.&nbsp; You may want to consider not checking out to dollars or euros or whatever the fuck they use where you happen to be, at least not for a week or so.&nbsp; Here&#039;s the bitcointalk.org thread if you&#039;re interested (clearnet of course): https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=124482.0<br /><br /><br /><br />tl;dr -- bitcoin price may skyrocket this month.&nbsp; I guarantee nothing.

				I feel stupid for not converting my savings into bitcoins before the summer when they were under five dollars a pop. At the back of my mind I always think, bitcoin is never going away, they will only ever increase in value over time, just horde them for fucks sake. <br /><br />One day in the future when the bitcoin is worth an ounce of gold I am going to look back at my purchasing stats and say, wow I spent a million dollars on drugs!

				The downside is that bitcoin could be replaced bu something nearly identical. There is no intrinsic value in a bitcoin, even if it took significant resources to mine one. Also, the cost factor of mining bitcoin is solely electrical power. which can become cheaply available at off-peak periods of time at any point.

				This is good news. More BTC purchases will add stability to the market in the long run.<br /><br />Ben, even the USD currency has no &quot;intrinsic value&quot; other than that other people are willing to continue trading it for things of tangible value to individuals in the economy. Unless you consider the whims of the Federal reserve intrinsic value.<br /><br />Even to a certain extent, Gold has no intrinsic value. We don&#039;t need gold for our own survival. It&#039;s only valuable in a post-scarcity economy as a novelty (and with some manufacturing uses).<br /><br />Bitcoins are no different.<br /><br />The more companies and people using bitcoins, the more trading can be done, the more value it can provide to people.

				I posted about this subject here a few weeks ago and was met with a surprising amount of indifference. If you go to the bitcointalk forums, a similar sentiment is felt towards our kind as well. I find both quite surprising, as&nbsp; I always assumed there was a large overlap between proponents of bitcoin and Silk Road users due to our perceived similar philosophies towards the intrusions of &quot;big government&quot;. <br /><br />I&#039;m betting a rather large amount of my portfolio to bitcoin though (at least for a unemployed college student with little disposable income). My reasoning for doing so is different than yours OP, although I do agree that the bitcoin movement very well might pick up mainstream support in the long run. <br /><br />No, I&#039;m betting &quot;big&quot; on bitcoin (about 50 BTC) for essentially the same reason this guy is:<br />&nbsp;https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=116937.0 (Although the OP is kind of a dick, it&#039;s definitely worth a read)<br />I personally believe the Silk Road is still only at its starting line with regards to the illicit internet drug trade, something that requires the use of bitcoin to maintain its anonymity. Assuming places like the Silk Road and its variants are here to stay, and taking into consideration the ever-decreasing amount of bitcoin available to be mined (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Total_bitcoins_over_time.png), I think investing in them isn&#039;t an irrational decision. If Tor-based drug sites continue to exist five years down the road, then it&#039;s only natural to assume that the value of bitcoin will go up substantially. <br /><br />The one troublesome aspect in all of this is the fact that the majority of bitcoin speculators have similar &quot;get rich quick&quot; sentiments, so perhaps bitcoin is already overvalued. I was also fortunate enough to avoid the infamous bitcoin crash of June &#039;11, so I may also have some rose-tinted glasses on due to my past luck with investing in bitcoin.<br />

				Interestingly, if I had run out and bought $10,000 worth of BTC instead of making that post, I&#039;d be a thousand dollars richer right now less than what, 48 hours later.&nbsp; I didn&#039;t have 10k sitting in an exchange ready to buy coins anyway though, so -- no sense lamenting what wasn&#039;t possible anyway.&nbsp; Don&#039;t feel bad about being poorer or anything, I&#039;m just neglecting to admit I don&#039;t have 10k in cash anywhere for anything, heh...<br /><br />Something came to mind while reading the replies though (I did not read all dozen pages of the link, BTW), which sure as Hell made me stop dead and do some thinking when I first read about it: interestingly enough, with Bitcoin, a lot of people subscribe to the belief that &quot;there can be only one.&quot;&nbsp; When you think about the concept and implementation, any competing currency will either be based on a totally different proof of work (what makes it take so long to mine for coins is the &quot;proof of work,&quot; thing, so you have to &quot;prove&quot; you&#039;ve done a certain amount of work basically), which makes all the Bitcoin miners unable to transfer their vast Bitcoin-designed rigs to cash in on this new competing currency.&nbsp; That&#039;s one option, which means the competing currency could possibly overtake and destroy Bitcoin.&nbsp; Though it&#039;s pretty unlikely, since Bitcoin is kind of struggling to gain real traction itself and it isn&#039;t even fighting a similar &amp; competing currency -- how would a new currency win.&nbsp; shrug.&nbsp; Could happen though.<br /><br />Or, possibility two: the proof of work for the competing currency is similar enough that bitcoin miners can switch right over and swallow the competing currency whole. A group of mining pools could agree to act as one entity, and basically make the competing currency useless because they could almost at will successfully double-spend (the 51% Bitcoin network attack thingie, long story, but 51% or more is enough to start gaining control over BTC).&nbsp; So it would fail.&nbsp; Nobody would use it.&nbsp; It would be unreliable and pointless.&nbsp; Dead before it begins, hoorah for BTC, the miners all go back to their homes and some poor guy&#039;s cryptocurrency dream is squashed like a bug.<br /><br />So in case 2, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can survive.&nbsp; And as for case 1, nobody is even sure if it&#039;s actually possible to have an effective, alternative proof-of-work mechanism.&nbsp; Nobody&#039;s proved that you can&#039;t or anything, but nobody&#039;s actually proved that it&#039;s possible either.&nbsp; It may or may not be.&nbsp; If it is, Bitcoin could possibly fail in favor of a competitor (but it seems like a longshot).<br /><br /><br />So, in a nutshell: in case 2, Bitcoin cannot be conquered and the competing currency dies miserably. In the case 1, *if* it&#039;s possible to have an effective alternate proof-of-work mechanism, Bitcoin is unlikely to be conquered.&nbsp; That&#039;s the argument as I understand it.<br /><br /><br />If you think cryptocurrency and the whole Bitcoin concept is the thing of the future... BTC seems like a very solid wager.

				Bitcoin has already had its share of massive spikes. Back when it was over $30 USD per BTC mining was very profitable indeed, and after that peak it faded back down to a couple of dollars (methinks someone who got in on bitcoins early and had bulk coin decided to cash out).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that can survive.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Have you not investigated any of it&#039;s spin off competing crypto currencies, like litecoin? Some of these other coins solve the 51% problem that bitcoin has. Also you cannot switch dedicated bitcoin mining hardware (FPGAs and ASICs, which is what all the serious miners use) to mine litecoin (some of the other coins use the same crypt algo as bitcoin though). Choosing a new &quot;proof of work&quot; part is easy, just use a well established cryptographic function that you can adjust difficulty for arbitrarily. Litecoin uses scrypt for instance (more CPU friendly than bitcoins algorithm).<br /><br />You can mine litecoin today and it&#039;s about on par with profitability as mining bitcoins on GPUs, it just needs more market capitalization like bitcoin has before its value can really increase.

				You make it sound like I was stating an absolute -- I was just relaying an argument that I found fascinating when I initially found it&nbsp; :)&nbsp; That&#039;s all.&nbsp; I do think there&#039;s quite a bit of merit to the argument, but as you&#039;ve just pointed out, it&#039;s not quite as definitive as it may appear at first glance.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t actually looked into Litecoin at all, but after reading the first two sentences describing its proof of work, I guess somebody found an alternate proof of work that BTC mining hardware can&#039;t just take control of.&nbsp; I&#039;m really not so sure though... from what I understand (which is literally what I just said I read), the memory requirements are nothing more than a speedup, not an actual requirement of the algorithm.&nbsp; You can just compute the value at RAM address XYZ when necessary instead of fetching it, and basically make the memory requirement completely vanish.<br /><br />That&#039;s actually exactly the same situation as you find with Bitcoins.&nbsp; It&#039;s possible to have every single possibility computed and stored in memory, and to just look up which one solves a block.&nbsp; It&#039;s preposterous to think you could do that with bitcoin mining, of course, but it&#039;s the same thing with both litecoins and bitcoins is what I mean.&nbsp; Bitcoin miners have to compute it because they don&#039;t have the resources necessary to hold all possibilities.&nbsp; Litecoins are different -- you can store all the possibilities of that step of the algorithm without always having to compute it, but you can still compute it if you want.&nbsp; The devil is in the details, I suppose: I&#039;m not familiar enough with either algorithm to know why they&#039;re more dissimilar than they appear.&nbsp; I think it&#039;s a bit of a bad sign for Litecoin though that Wikipedia deleted their entry... hrm.<br /><br />The $30 to $2 crash was because of the high profile hacks (e.g. MtGox) at the time, wasn&#039;t it?&nbsp; I don&#039;t see how anybody dumping any amount of coins could see it plummet the way it did *and* stay down so low for so long, but I&#039;m no economist.

				I think there are multiple reasons for the bitcoin spike. Yes the Mt Gox debacle had a little impact (which was reversed), but the bulk of the value from the peak had dissapeared before that happened.<br /><br />I think there was a bit of a bitcoin &quot;pump and dump&quot;, i.e. someone with a lot of bitcoins talked up their investment prospects, then sold off at the peak. People have done it many times with penny stocks (which bitcoins pretty much were at one stage). Combine that with the fact that you have constant inflation of US dollars (and all world currencies) which leads to overinvestment bubbles (like housing, dot coms, of course bitcoin bubble is tiny compared to these) and there&#039;s pretty much all you need for significant bubble. The very early adopters of bitcoin hold quite a sizable chunk of all bitcoins too.

				That does not solve the problem that it takes quite some time for a BTC transaction to be finite and approved.<br /><br />Surely you can trust the client if you so desire - you can trust someone paying in cash without looking at the banknotes too. <br /><br />Bitcoin needs something quick that can be more or less relied upon. Confirmation within a minute with 99.9% cetraintaly would surely help acceptance.

				Its a rather complex story with how a currency like the USD is backed. The FED does have some reserves of gold and forgeign currency, which would determine some minimum value for the us dollar. The fait system has caused this backing to be very marginal however. Perhaps the FED as $0.01 worth&nbsp; of gold in store for every dollar bill printed, it could even be less. But however low it is, it is a nonzero value. <br /><br />With the USD there is a big catch however. US foreign debts are all taken in USD amounts, so the US federal bank could simply (and legally) print whatever amount of dollar&nbsp; bills are required to settle that debt. This would result in a severe decline of the dollar against foreign currencies, but it would settle the debt as agreed upon. If the debt would have been agreed upon in ounces of gold or some other tangible commodity, the us would be bankrupt by now. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s just the ability to print extra money that undermines the value of the dollar though.<br /><br />Without it, everyone in the world would be able to convert their dollar bills into assets within the us. Obviously there are instruments to circumvent the risk of money printing however, such as currency futures. <br /><br />Given that, when the dollar drops, it would still be possible for those that hold dollar options to obtain something of value, such as nationalized companies, land, natural resources and such. <br /><br />With bitcoins this option is not available so far - there are no options traded for bitcoin versus dollars, euro, gold, or anything else. <br /><br />On the other hand, bitcoin is no longer a fringe currency either. The total value of all bitcoins available today is well over 200 million us dollars. Compared to the amount of us dollars on the market this is insignificant, but its the gdp of a small country by now.

				I agree that the value of a currency has a lot to do with faith, however, other factors are involved, for example:<br /><br />Lets say there are only two currencies (countries) available:<br />(a) costs 0a to print 1a<br />(b) cost 0.01b to print 1b<br /><br />Both countries are identical, except that country (a) has found a cheaper way to print money.<br /><br />The exchange rate would favor (a).<br /><br />

If the trust fails so does the commodity. <br />I read an article a couple of weeks ago about a wildlife nut that wrote a fake letter and gave it to the press saying that the bank was not going to extend their finance. The mining company lost over $100M because the investors got scared and no longer trusted the product. <br /><br />With BTC, I am really interested to see how it goes. There are so many factors that are going to make prices fluctuate (especially with 70% of BTC never being traded). If 5-10% of these coins suddenly come to market, or SR gets closed down etc, prices will plummet. <br />If BTC becomes more socially acceptable and a investment commodity, prices will Sky Rocket
