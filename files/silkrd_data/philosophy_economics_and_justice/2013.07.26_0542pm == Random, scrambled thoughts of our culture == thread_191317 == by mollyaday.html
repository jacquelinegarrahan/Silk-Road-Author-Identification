				&quot;You take the blue pill – the story ends, you wake up in your bed and<br />believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill – you stay in<br />Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.&quot; Morpheus, The<br />Matrix<br /><br />&nbsp;Ignorance maybe bliss, and afford people comfort. But it does not give freedom.(something far to rare in this age to acquire totally, but we can sure as hell stetch our shackles and chains.)<br /><br />&nbsp;Although our lifestyles are drastically different, in the sense of our daily existence, we all chose to tunnel into the rabbit hole. We are all burrowing deeping, while being hunted.<br /><br />&nbsp;And with all the eyes set upon us, the tools of the powers that be, and the lifestyle we have chosen, there is no finish line to the security we seek. The culture we have become a part of, can hopefully give us some freedom in the prison planet that has een caged upon us.<br /><br />&nbsp;These were some thoughts scrambled in my head during a trip that I felt needed to be written down.<br /><br />&nbsp;Too many people don&#039;t take the necessary precautions while using The Road. I know this, because I was one of them. In my case, I felt it was not necessary because I am small time buyer, and figured it was not a big deal.<br /><br />&nbsp;But I realized this isn&#039;t about individual freedom, or getting my treats and getting high. This is about something much more important. This is about humanity&#039;s timeless struggle to be free from abusive, money hungry control freaks.<br /><br />&nbsp;Buyers and sellers, and anyone who doesn&#039;t want eyes prying into their souls, don&#039;t be like I was. Take the extra steps. Use PGP, Tails, VPN, whatever it takes to secure each other. Because this is not a boxing match, a one on one fight. We are all in this together.<br /><br />&nbsp;Don&#039;t be like I was. Because that lackadaisical attitude will be the downfall of this potential revolution on the horizon.We have too little time on this earth together, to let tyrants tear away our spirit.<br /><br />&nbsp;Maybe it was the drugs talking, and maybe I&#039;m romanticizing what we have at our disposal. But I think we all agree we have something great here, and the only way to keep it&nbsp; from slipping away is diligence, integrity, and caution.<br />&nbsp;Good things may not last, but they can be prolonged. And in the times we are living in, we need the good things to last as long as possible.<br /><br />EDIT: Sorry for the rant, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll look back at this on a sober head and think&quot;What an idealistic, steriotypical cheeseball&quot;. But there has to be some truth in the ramblings of this madman.....I hope.
