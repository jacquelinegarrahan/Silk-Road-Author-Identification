				After weeks of nominating and voting the decision is finally in! The movie we are watching for our 2nd Official Movie Night is.... (drum roll please):&nbsp; A Scanner Darkly!!!<br /><br />So get those torrents downloading, those netflix accounts streaming, and (for those old fashioned types in the audience) those DVD players turned on, cause it&#039;s time for Movie Night!<br /><br />So the way this works is you watch the movie today whenever you get the chance, (I will be watching it later tonight), and then we can spend all weekend or longer discussing it here in this thread. Sound fun? Good! Now get to it.<br /><br />P.S. - 2nd place in the voting was Dr. Strangelove. I highly reccomend watching that this weekend as well if you have the time, and if one of you would like to start up another thread for discussion on that (or any other movie from the nominations) please feel free to do so. <br /><br /><br />Links where the movie can be downloaded from or streamed:<br /><br />http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/8607188/A_Scanner_Darkly_%282006%29_720p_BrRip_x264_-_YIFY<br />http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/4472882/A.Scanner.Darkly%5B2006%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-aXXo<br />https://isohunt.com/torrent_details/491197411/A+scanner+darkly?tab=summary<br />https://isohunt.com/torrent_details/20056225/A+scanner+darkly?tab=summary<br />https://www.canistream.it<br />http://vodly.to/watch-1804-A-Scanner-Darkly

				love the alex jones cameo in this!<br /><br />like the poster above, seen it a few times already but it&#039;s well worth a watch if you haven&#039;t seen it. <br />look woody harrelson in this (and more or less everything else he stars in!).<br /><br />dr.strangelove is a classic, i think i&#039;ll curl up and watch this tomorrow!

				First time I have seen this movie... And wow! I found it a little hard to follow in places due to the distraction of the animation. I have never seen a movie on drugs before but had to laugh at the inter dimensional being reading out the list of sins &quot;At least I had good wine&quot;. I get the impression that this was quite difficult to transfer into a feature length movie from a novel, I would rate at a solid 7/10

				Well i like that ! Certainly was not was i was expecting, just finished watching it and to my surprise im REALLY REALLY glad that i didnt watch it whilest off my tits as there was so much in the movie to pay&nbsp; attention to.<br />Also now i get to watch again whilest in a seriously altered state. I wuld love to watch it tripping, but as most people know you get more fun out of trying to use the tv rather than watch it lol.<br /><br />A damn good film, well worth a watch and the link provided earlier by some to watch it streaming was faultless and high quality. so im well happy !<br /><br />Thank you all for a most enjoyable couple of hours.

				Haha if you guys thought A Scanner Darkly was hard to keep up with then you really don&#039;t want to watch Waking Life. It&#039;s done in the same style of cinematography as A Scanner Darkly but it&#039;s full of cameos and a brief appearances by all sorts of intellectuals, physicists, psychologists etc and discusses consciousness, dream states and lucid dreaming, the perception of &quot;reality&quot; or the matrix if you will. <br />Now that&#039;s a hard one to get your head around...

The only reason this movie is worth watching is Robert Downey Jr and Woody Harrleson tweaking out and Winona Ryder. A Scanner Darkly is the kind of movie you watch with your stoner girlfriend because she&#039;s too retarded to enjoy Blade Runner. It&#039;s like watching one of those old rotoscoped Charles Schwab commercials mixed with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and it makes just about as much sense. It made 7 million dollars at the box office for a reason. That reason is it kind of sucks. Phillip K. Dick from what I heard loved the parts of Blade Runner he got to see before he died. I think he would have hated this movie.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />gotta disagree with you there bruce campbell. judging by the tone of your language i can assume that you and i grew up with different values. that being said i believe movies like A Scanner Darkly are made to appeal to those of us who search for multiple meanings in artforms such as movies. i personally have the good/bad habit of analyzing movies, books, even spongebob in order to realize some kind of overall messages or themes. sometimes it hard to get a moral out of it (heavily depending on personal ect ect ect ) but A Scanner Darkly for me was pretty helpful as a way to re-examine the society we live in. Stories about tyrannical entities enslaving those by the production of addictive and permanently brain altering substances really hits home with me due to personal reasons (family ect.) and I was able to feel a type of realization. i understand that peoples upbringings ect ect can impact how deeply you resonate with a movie. hope that made sense what the fuck do i know

I&#039;d give a similar review of Fight Club if it was chosen. A Scanner Darkly is a sterotypical drug movie. I&#039;d have rather watched Requiem for a dream or the Basketball Diaries if we were going to have a circle jerk and watch and discuss a drug movie. The novel was poignant. The movie caters to stereotypes and the &quot;whoa trippy visuals man&quot; demographic instead of the intentions (or my interpretations of his intentions) of the author. The afterwood specifically lists &quot;Phil&quot; as a victim of drug abuse and damage. He fried his brain and pancreas with amphetamines. Maybe I just hate every Dick movie. Ridley Scott got input from Dick directly and the fact that he never got to see the finished film and never saw success pisses me off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />i havent read the book so i really couldnt take this discussion any further in that direction. the upbringing thing- my opinion is that our personalities are shaped by multiple factors, childhood being a big one. people with different personalities can find very different meanings in the same events. and everything else you said.... i disagree(especially the fight club thing you did NOT see that plot twist coming) anyways, what do you think the author&#039;s intentions were? is it worth a read even after iv seen the movie in your opinion?

				Hi guys, thanks for the good words.. remember silk road is a marketplace and a talking place, and neither should exist without the other :)<br /><br />&nbsp;that DVD commentary triggered something I&#039;ve been meaning to say for a long while - glad I was able to post it, gotta keep it close at hand to explain to others<br /><br />the animation is special since it was filmed and then they took about a year to convert it and doctor it up so you get real and surreal thrown together - might be worth watching with the sound off sometime as background<br /><br />Like I said earlier, the commentary was mainly driven by Dick&#039;s daughter giving oddball connections of the movie as it related to what she knew of her father...&nbsp; When Link talked he seemed to not want to really spill his guts like he would with his close friends.. that&#039;s my impression, and Keanu is a just a hollow ship floating in orbit<br /><br />see ya on the road..&nbsp; had a awesome trip the other day, much love all around<br /><br /><br /><br />

I&#039;d have rather watched Requiem for a dream or the Basketball Diaries if we were going to have a circle jerk and watch and discuss a drug movie. The novel was poignant. The movie caters to stereotypes and the &quot;whoa trippy visuals man&quot; demographic instead of the intentions (or my interpretations of his intentions) of the author. The afterwood specifically lists &quot;Phil&quot; as a victim of drug abuse and damage. He fried his brain and pancreas with amphetamines. Maybe I just hate every Dick movie. Ridley Scott got input from Dick directly and the fact that he never got to see the finished film and never saw success pisses me off.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp; +1! I like this film, I haven&#039;t read A Scanner Darkly, the book, but I&#039;ve read a few of Phil k. Dick&#039;s short stories, though, and I get the feeling that the film doesn&#039;t feel like it does the writer justice.&nbsp; The one thing it needed, I would&#039;ve liked to have seen Winona Ryder&#039;s sexy body, and some hard-core fucking.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I mean, we&#039;re talking semi-animation, right? have some fun with it! I was like &quot;why is this dude with this cold ass don&#039;t-touch-me chick when he&#039;s a good looking guy? she&#039;s his girlfriend/dealer who &quot;snorts too much coke&quot; so there&#039;s no fucking anywhere.&nbsp; These guys are asexual and impotent.&quot;&nbsp; that could just be me, though, amphetamines and cocaine often internalize sexual desire, so WYSIWYG.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;I also didn&#039;t completely like Fear and Loathing with Johnny Depp for the same reasons, and I saw it after reading the book. It&#039;s entertaining, sure, makes you think a bit, but &quot;whoa visuals&quot; only gets you so far with psychedelia, the real kicker is the mind-fuck, which is very difficult to portray in film, and I HATE voiceovers. Blade Runner is fucking awesome, though.&nbsp; &nbsp;The only thing I didn&#039;t like about the film version Requiem for a Dream(haven&#039;t read the book) is that it felt a *bit* like a rip-off of Panic in Needle Park, only sub the trip to Florida with Riker&#039;s Island.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, when the fuck has NYC ever run out of Heroin? seems a bit far-fetched to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;I always have this love/hate thing about drug movies, they either get the feeling right, but not the facts, or they get the facts straight, with no craziness.&nbsp; &nbsp; Gotta love Movie Night, though! <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone should nominate Repo Man(1984) that movie is fucking awesome beyond words, everyone should see it.
