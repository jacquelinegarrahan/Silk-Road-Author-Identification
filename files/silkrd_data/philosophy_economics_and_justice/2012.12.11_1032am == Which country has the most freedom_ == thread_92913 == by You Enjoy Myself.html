				Where is the freedom at? When I look out my window I don&#039;t see as much freedom as I would like (the U.S.). Which country beats them all and why? My best guess would be the Netherlands but I&#039;ve never left the country so what do I know.

				Depends on the freedom. The United States has some of the most progressive free speech laws in the world. France and Germany have less draconian drug laws, but they ban Nazi symbols. None of these countries, including the Netherlands, allows you to keep multiple wives, but Saudi Arabia does. However, Saudi Arabia doesn&#039;t allow alcohol.<br /><br />You might enjoy a corrupt third world country where the authorities are easily bribed.

				Which prision has the most freedom?&nbsp; <br /><br />I asked myself the same question a while back.&nbsp; It took me a while to realize that I wasn&#039;t asking myself exactly the right question - I felt like a cow wondering &quot;which slaughterhouse has the cleanest floor?&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Then I heard about seasteading and discovered that the high seas are about as close as I could get to my idea of freedom. as long as you aren&#039;t laundering money or smuggling drugs to the US or an actual pirate (I&#039;m sure this list isn&#039;t exhaustive) you can do pretty much whatever floats your boat if you&#039;re far enough from shore.&nbsp; &nbsp;;)<br /><br />Now I ask myself &quot;how can I live as free as possible?&quot; and so far what I&#039;ve come up with is a combination of perpetual travel (i.e. wherever you are, the gov&#039;t considers you a tourist/traveler), crypto-anarchy, agorism and tradecraft.&nbsp; Now I&#039;m always looking for more weapons to add to my arsenol of freedom<br /><br />Once I can afford a nuclear powered submarine yaht, I will be satisfied&nbsp; 8)<br />

				Every country has different levels of freedom for its citizens based on different factors. Even in a complete dictatorship there are some people that have significant freedoms while others have no liberties at all. If you have money and power then freedom is likely to follow regardless of what country you are in.

				I&#039;d love to be able to say Denmark, but frankly; it&#039;s just not true. &quot;Freedom&quot; is a peculiar concept in a statist nation, but if you&#039;re into specific &#039;freedoms&#039; (is there such a thing? to divide freedom into discrete units seems ironically paradoxical to me) then Czech Republic, as of recent, enjoys laxed drug laws and the Jizerka mountains are great for exploration - both inner and outer ;)

				Well, if we&#039;re going to specific places, i&#039;d suggest the village of Vang Vieng in Laos. While Laos actually has pretty stringent drug control by the letter of the law, it is not enforced there, and the most common activities for tourists include bobbing down the river in a tube, smoking some pot on the way down, and enjoy a &#039;magic pizza&#039; after... though smoking some opium is no problem at all either. <br /><br />Combine that with bars that play infinite re-runs of series like friends or the simpsons on big screens, and you get the idea.

				Laws are one thing and culture is another.&nbsp; You will be limited in your freedom if you live where you grew up.&nbsp; You will generally be constrained by the moral code of social conduct.&nbsp; Expats enjoy a ton of freedom in that respect, and Thailand offers a lot of pleasures to pursue.&nbsp; But drug laws are harsh and there is no free speech here.&nbsp; People are regularly jailed for speaking out against the government or monarchy.

				Oh dear Thailand :)<br /><br />I love the country, but in terms of legislation its a very very odd one. Drug legislation is extremely harsh by the letter of the law, and drug dealing is considered to be a crime worse than murder, since it is an assault on society as a whole rather than just on a single individual. Drug trafficking carries the death sentence in thailand. Despite that many drugs are widely available in the country at very reasonable prices. <br /><br />Enforcement is very very variable in thailand, and outside of bangkok pretty lax where drugs are concerned. <br /><br />If you insult the king on the other hand, you can count on several years of imprisonment regardless of where you do that. I wouldn&#039;t want to discourage anyone from visiting thailand, but if you do, you should be aware of laws and enforcement. Just stating something can get you into much more trouble than posessing some drugs for personal use there. In bankgok i&#039;d suggest keeping to smoking a drinking - any other drugs can lead to very expensive bribes and even prosecution.<br />

				That is hard to decipher, because countries have varying laws on varying topics.<br />Road laws, perhaps Germany or Europe.<br />Drug laws, probably Netherlands.<br />Freedom of speech, the United States.<br />Freedom of personal choices, the United States or parts of Europe.<br /><br />Living in Australia, everything is very restricted here.

If your main question is &quot;will i end in jail for smoking pot, snorting coke or shooting heroin&quot;, the answer in the netherlands is a rather definite &quot;No&quot;. <br /><br />The problem with the Dutch drug policy is that is entirely based on &#039;tolerance&#039;. Possessing and using amounts of drugs for personal use (one or a few single doses) is technically still illegal, but never prosecuted. In case of drugs other then cannabis a small amount will be confiscated by police if found, but prosecution is unlikely, and even if it does the penalty would be a relatively small fine.<br /><br />This all seems nice enough, but its not without its problems. For example with cannabis, an amount of 5 grams or less is considered to be for personal use and no action is taken. 5 to 30 grams is considered a &#039;tradeable&#039; amount and will be confiscated, possibly prosecuted resulting in a fine. Amounts over 30 grams are likely to be prosecuted and still result in prison sentences sometimes, especially when the amount is large or the intent to sell is proven. <br /><br />Obviously this can cause odd situations. Someone that smokes a gram a day may have 30 grams for strict personal&nbsp; use, just as you may buy a carton of cigarettes or box of wine for personal use over the course of more than a day or two. <br /><br /><br />Politically it&#039;s still an issue though. There is a fairly large part of parliament that would want to legalize it entirely, but so far this has never reached a majority. Other parties want to keep things the way they are, and a fair number want to impose more regulation, such as only allowing coffeeshops a certain distance away of schools, or only making them accessible for dutch nationals. <br /><br />As usual in dutch politics this will end in taking no action at all - you&#039;ll probably still be able to smoke pot in amsterdam as a foreigner, and you still would not want to get busted with 100 grams of pot in the glove compartment. <br />

A downsiide i&#039;ve noticed in cambodia more then anywhere else in the world is the solvent-abusing kids huffing glue fumes from sandwich bags. I haven&#039;t seen any of that in laos - not in vang vieng, not in vientiane or anywhere else in the country. <br />.<br />Laos may be much more sparsely populated compared to cambodia, but i got the impression its not nearly as miserable.

				Mentioning Laos and &quot;freedom&quot; in the same sentence is the epitome of ignorance.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know where to begin with this.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; It is a one-party communist surveillance state with a horrible human rights record.&nbsp; Read the book &quot;Hunted like Animals&quot;.<br /><br />This is from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Main article: Human rights in Laos<br /><br />The Constitution that was promulgated in 1991 and amended in 2003 contains most key safeguards for human rights. For example, in Article 8 it makes it clear that Laos is a multiethnic state and is committed to equality between ethnic groups. The Constitution also has provisions for gender equality and freedom of religion, for freedom of speech, press and assembly. On 25 September 2009, Laos ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, nine years after signing the treaty. The stated policy objectives of both the Lao government and international donors remain focused toward achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.[47][48]<br /><br />However, Amnesty International has raised concerns about the ratification record of the Laos Government on human rights standards and its lack of cooperation with the UN human rights mechanisms and legislative measures which impact negatively on human rights. It has also raised concerns in relation to freedom of expression, poor prison conditions, restrictions on freedom of religions, protection of refugees and asylum-seekers and the death penalty.[49]<br /><br />In October 1999, 30 young people were arrested for attempting to display posters calling for peaceful economic, political and social change in Laos. Five of them were arrested and subsequently sentenced to up to 10 years imprisonment on charges of treason. One has since died due to his treatment by prison guards, while one has been released. The surviving three men should have been released by October 2009, but their whereabouts remains unknown.[49]<br /><br />Laos and Vietnamese troops were reported to have raped and killed four Christian Hmong women in Xieng Khouang province in 2011, according to US campaign group The Centre for Public Policy Analysis. CPPA also said other Christian and independent Buddhist and animist believers were being persecuted.[50][51]<br /><br />

				It&#039;s easy to point out a million things wrong in Laos - after all it is a very poor country where the government has little grip on people, and the political agenda is quirky at best.<br />&nbsp;<br />What gives some parts of laos freedom is simply lack of enforcement: Something may be illegal under national legislation, but if regional and local police do not enforce it, the letter of the law has little effect. This is why you can use drugs quite freely in places like vang vieng, but also why crimes like rapes go unpunished in some areas. There is a degree of anarchy there, which sometimes works out very well, and sometimes not at all. <br /><br />You see this in several developing countries though. In the west we are very used to the law being upheld, but in many developing countries that simply is not the case all off the time. Often these countries do not have much of a federal police force, leaving enforcement of the national laws at liberty to local authorities.<br /><br />Its something like how they tried to enforce a smoking ban in indonesia. It is implemented in jakarta, but its not likely anyone on another island gives a shit about it. Add in a bit of corruption and you&#039;ll find yourself having a cig with a police officer inl an eastern java bus station, provided you share a $1 beer with the guy. Practically there is nothing wrong with that situation - to the letter of the law there is a problem, but one that it settled amicably. Some call this corrupt, others call it pragmatic, and most aren&#039;t even aware of the situation.

All countries have their price. Some will welcome you and your self made fortune with open arms knowing that your just being on board is to their net benefit. That&#039;s the way it should be. Lots of people surrender their US citizenships when they decide they prefer not to get hit with billion dollar tax receipts. See Saverin, Eduardo. <br /><br />Because really, most people referring to &quot;freedom&quot; seem to think of it in one of two ways. Either it&#039;s the 1) freedom from taxation or 2) freedom from being persecuted by the government for victimless crimes (namely drug possession and use).<br /><br />If you find yourself newly wealthy and can find a government to help you minimize or even skirt altogether #1, you might decide to reward that government with patronage. What good is retaining your US citizenship when the US government is one of the only in the world that retains the right to tax you even if you have dual citizenship and move to your other country of citizenship? East Asian Tigers are great for this. Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore, along with their maximum rates enjoyed by the rich makes you understand why the rich work so hard to emigrate there. To give you an idea, the highest income tax rate for Hong Kong&#039;s wealthiest is 15%. In Singapore it&#039;s 20%. In the East Asian gambling Mecca of Macau it&#039;s 12%. So to say the rich skate there comparatively is a vast understatement. <br /><br />If you&#039;re independently wealthy and want to find a country that will allow #1 and #2 then you pull a McAfee and move to a semi-autonomous rogue state like Belize that offers luxuriously dark banks out of reach of the IRS while their LE and coast guard are notoriously easy and cheap to bribe. Problem with McAfee is that he insisted on adding a #3 to the list, needing a government that would also allow him to commit murder after he offed his neighbor during a bath salt induced MDPV binge who he got tired of always complaining about his dog.<br /><br />Still, given how much he was allowed to get away with for a quite a long fucking time ... I&#039;m actually quite partial to Belize.

But the reality is racism still pervades these institutions in practice even if it&#039;s supposed to be rid of Jim Crow in theory.<br /><br />So let&#039;s start with how blacks are generally presumed guilty and subjected to far harsher treatment by LE than other racial groups. For instance, studies have shown they&#039;re much more likely to get pulled over and their vehicles searched even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. The disparity of their treatment by LE has been so pervasive even that the DoJ had to step in with a number of local LEA&#039;s around the country for flagrant civil rights violations. LAPD and NOPD serve as prolific examples of institutional racism that have become commonplace in big city LEAs nationwide. <br /><br />All the empirical data collected has concluded that all racial groups buy and sell drugs at the same rate. Not that blacks are somehow more prone to distribution and consumption of illegal narcotics. Yet somehow LE agencies disproportionately target blacks and black neighborhoods in their WoD. Why? This can be partially explained by socioeconomics. But it doesn&#039;t account for all of it. And do you need me to tell you how racist the crack laws on the books were and still are? In 2010 they were changed so that instead of sentencing at 100 times the severity than if a person were caught with the equivalent amount of coke in their possession, it&#039;s now only 18 times the severity. What a relief huh? So with such fucked up racist laws on the books, can you really say with a straight face that courts treat the inner city slinger to the same punishments as the suburban yayo dealer? The larger populations of black dealers languishing in prison received much stiffer sentences not because they commit &quot;more crimes&quot;, nor is it because there are more black dealers than any other race. It&#039;s because they&#039;re doing 15-25 years for selling crack.<br /><br />And don&#039;t get me started on the overwhelming evidence that shows the biggest indicator in determining whether a defendant will be given the death sentence in sentencing is the race of the defendant if the victim is white. A premium is placed on white life in this regard by the human juries in the &quot;system&quot;.

				the reason i am doubtful that white racism plays a major role in black incarceration rates, is because there have been surveys in which people are asked: what crime have you been a victim of in the last year? who was the perpetrator? what was the race? and what is found is that blacks, whites, and asians are being reported as perpetrators of crimes at roughly the same rate at which they are being incarcerated for these crimes.<br /><br />i don&#039;t know if this applies to victimless crimes such as drug dealing, so you may be right on that score. there may be a racial bias against blacks, it just doesn&#039;t seem to be a major factor when it comes to assault, rape, murder, etc.

				First of all, how do you define freedom?&nbsp; Freedom from something, freedom to do something, both?&nbsp; A truly free country is usually thought of as a country not run by a dictator, but, as we all know, dictatorship can take other forms.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think any country is truly free, there is always something.&nbsp; Want real freedom?&nbsp; Get several million dollars and see how free you all of a sudden become.

				I&#039;d go for remote places where you can create your own mikrokosmos of freedom<br /><br />siberia, alaska or maybe warmer regions like spain. on final thought definitly spain<br />with the momentary economic situation in spain its pretty cheap to buy land there<br />and clima isnt so bad either.. <br /><br />i&#039;d love to be totally independend. eating your own grown food<br />and maybe making some little spare cash from SR ;)

				as previously mentioned, it depends on what sort of freedoms you&#039;re talking about. Governments by their nature impose restrictions on their people. For example, murder is illegal in just about every country. Portugal has the most drug-friendly laws iirc, while at the other end of the spectrum in Singapore not only will you go to jail for spitting gum onto the sidewalk, but possession of more than 15g of H, 30g of coke or morphine, 250g of meth, or 500g of pot will get you the death penalty (by hanging).&nbsp; Lesser amounts would spare you from capital punishment in favor of spending a few years in jail and getting caned (if you are male, I don&#039;t think they cane women or old men)

				Bulgaria and Serbia are both pretty good. The governments and police are fairly corrupt but tax rates are low, and at least in Bulgaria, police often will take a bribe to look the other way for most non-crimes like traffic tickets and small drug charges. Bulgarian people are fascinated by foreigners, also, they think us foreigners are cool, and not only that, Bulgaria&#039;s aging population means that younger people showing up and having the initiative to run their own businesses, and being that easily 80% of small businesses and sole traders in this country don&#039;t pay taxes.<br /><br />Not only that, but since january, the general attitude towards the government has soured pretty badly in Bulgaria. The government monopoly on heating services and the &#039;privatised resellers&#039; of this service stung everyone in the middle of a very cold winter with far out-of-scale bills, thousands of protesters were arrested and it&#039;s been 3 months and still there is no clear mandate for a proper parliament to be reinstated. Parliament has not been sitting for now nearly 4 months.<br /><br />Similar things have been happening in Poland as well, and apparently this all comes back to a russian monopoly on natural gas, and a lot of people in the former soviet bloc countries are PISSED about their governments selling them out like this. To me, this kind of thing is a good indicator of how much freedom the common people are defending directly instead of sitting on their hands letting the government pigs decide, which usually gets worse the les active people are in fighting against it.
