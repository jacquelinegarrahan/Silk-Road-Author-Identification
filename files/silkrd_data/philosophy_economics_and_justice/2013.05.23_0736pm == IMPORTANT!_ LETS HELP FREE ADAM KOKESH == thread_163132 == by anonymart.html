				Adam Kokesh got arrested on Saturday at a Philadelphia Pot Rally for exercising free speech. Police says he resisted arrest which videos clearly show he did not.<br /><br />Watch this video to find out how you can help: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAuPOHI1Les&amp;feature=youtu.be<br /><br />Go to this link to get more informed on what is going on:<br />http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/urban-game-changer/2013/may/23/philadelphia-rally-free-adam-kokesh-n-poe/<br /><br />Even if you dont like him which you should we need more people like him with the balls to fight for our liberties and he always does it peacefully the fact is that if they are doing this to him they can do it to any of us and if they get away with what they are doing to him we are next. We can allow this to become the norm.<br /><br />

				hell yeah brother!<br /><br />I love Adam, i saw this coming too, his planned armed march on DC on 7/4/13 was bound to piss someone off and they arrested him for that not smoking.<br /><br />The guys a marine, he coulda dropped LEO on his ass real quick if he wanted to truly &#039;resist&#039; believe me if he had wanted to resist, he woulda done it successfully and escaped, guaranteed. His website on clearnet: www.adamvstheman.com should set up a BTC wallet for him and all his causes, it would also help BTC gain notoriety among his supporters. <br /><br />

Even though I thought it was awesome his decision to march on July 4th and felt that was a truly patriotic way to celebrate independence day I was not planning on attending the march but if Adam is still in a federal cage by then I am planning on going.
