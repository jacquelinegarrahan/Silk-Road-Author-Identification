				Following suit with Tyler Durden&#039;s visionary experience, I began to reflect on moments which seemed to bear some resemblances.<br /><br />Preface--&nbsp; In African mythology, we&#039;ve got a pantheon of human-animal hybrids.&nbsp; It helps if you can multitask, but think of them as fully human and fully animal.<br /><br />In the beginning, Creator Mawu made all things.&nbsp; He made himself, he made his wife, he made his mother and his village.&nbsp; This cat made it all.&nbsp; And at that time, Tiger held the stories.&nbsp; These stories were full of darkness and pain.&nbsp; Of struggles and battles.&nbsp; The most hope you could achieve in the time of Tiger&#039;s stories was a victory over a foe.&nbsp; <br /><br />Then Mawu created a son.&nbsp; This son was brilliant, or at least brilliant at learning what Mawu could do.&nbsp; Mawu makes weapons, his son makes them just as well.&nbsp; Mawu cooks or hunts, his son follows suit.&nbsp; Mawu speaks to ease the village&#039;s mind, and his son does as well.<br /><br />I know imitation is the greatest form of flattery, but Mawu was pretty pissed.&nbsp; When attempts at the &quot;get a life&quot; talk failed, Mawu tried to run from his son.&nbsp; He crossed deserts and forests with his son always at his heels.&nbsp; Mawu created a canoe to carry him across bodies of water which did no good.&nbsp; I&#039;mma go ahead and say &quot;needy much?&quot;<br /><br />Mawu finally climbed a great mountain, asking the spider, Anansi, to create a ladder into heavens and to sever the connection once he had arrived.&nbsp; In return, Mawu gave the stories to Anansi.<br /><br />As contrast to Tiger&#039;s stories, Anansi added more flair, more glee, just as many struggles, but with always with a twist.&nbsp; Anansi was hardly the victor all of the time, often dying in his own stories, but the pain and darkness was not the motif that one would find in the days of Tiger.&nbsp; Since then, Tiger and Anansi were always at odds, for Tiger never forgave Anansi for taking the stories from him.<br /><br />Anansi is known as the trickster, strong in mind but not of muscle, and very vain.<br /><br />Fast Forward to a young kid on 2C-B, contemplating suicide, locked in a bathroom; tears rolling down his eyes.&nbsp; Enter sunlight and an inexplicable smile.&nbsp; Enter confidence and a stride, a new commentary being found, a walk through the woods and a smirk that made the day his.<br /><br />Since that day, a trend has formed in my life.&nbsp; I find myself weaving my path around me as if my nature.&nbsp; I find extreme turmoil usually ends in joke or an old Creole man telling me to &quot;shut the hell up and smoke a cig&quot;.&nbsp; I have noticed that, when defensive, this side of me seems prevalent.&nbsp; Usually mocking everyone and everything, myself included, this side of me knows what to do in a cinch.&nbsp; Sometimes I die, oftentimes I&#039;m reborn, but these characteristics all point to the ego of that spider, Anansi.&nbsp; <br /><br />The most curious part is, while the essence exists all the time, it&#039;s hardly prevalent unless I am in need of defending, especially from myself.&nbsp; It&#039;s the bit that believes in magic and words, the part that guides when no path is found.&nbsp; Call it innate or ethereal, it is the spirit of my survival and growth.<br /><br />The concept of a &quot;power animal&quot; seems to coalesce with this feeling, the one you seek when you fear or when you hurt.&nbsp; It is the answer to your falling.<br /><br />I don&#039;t mean this to be a profession of faith.&nbsp; What is in heaven that is not found inside of us?&nbsp; Rather, I wish to open up a dialogue, see if anyone has experienced something similar, studied anything to this extent.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, <br /><br />~~&lt;3 Ali

				Just a note to myself to respond to this later.&nbsp; No time right now.&nbsp; I could say a lot on this topic!<br /><br />Side note.&nbsp; Have you read Anansi boys?&nbsp; Great imagery to have in your mind, especially if you have an affinity for these creatures.&nbsp; Did a lot for me.
