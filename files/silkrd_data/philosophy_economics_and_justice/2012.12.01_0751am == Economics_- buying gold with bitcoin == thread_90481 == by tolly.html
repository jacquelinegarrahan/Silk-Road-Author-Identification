				I&#039;d keep some BTC too. It has outperformed gold significantly in the past few years, and is rather likely to continue to do so.

				I have been looking to find any real Gold Dealers that will deal in BTC. As yet, I can&#039;t find any. I think most Gold Dealers either don&#039;t know &amp;/or trust the BTC system yet or they can&#039;t be bothered with the extra financial security from regulators. And now with all the AML/CTF rules now implemented in most western countries, for the profit margins, its really not worth it.<br /><br />I would be very suspect of many of the websites claiming to send you Gold for BTC. Do your research carefully. I looked into 6 of the first 20 sites in my search engine and could not find any proof that gave me any confidence to make an order. <br /><br />I&#039;m interested if anyone knows a real Gold Dealer that will trade in BTC and is willing to work with international transactions legally.<br /><br />&nbsp;
