				Politics is not a separate discipline. It is the philosophy of using violence and threats to manipulate economics under the cover of law. :p

				What went wrong is that politics became a career, thus removing all the reason for it in the first place, As soon as people in politics are paid they compromise their politics, change policies, follow the party line etc because their jobs are on the line. You have very little political people involved in politics anymore, their lobbied to death so the corporations and those with the money to lobby and those with the modes of production run the word. Most people are just mindless, questionless pieces of meat that are too interested in the size of Justin Biebers shit, who fucked who on tv, X Factor and other such shite for them to get off their knees and even question what is wrong, unfortunately.

Economics and law are essential parts of politics - 2 simple examples. The &quot;war on drugs&quot; - political decision based on laws. The &quot;war&quot; on developing countries - no need to even fire a single shot, you can destroy whole countries with some economic decisions (subsiding certain industries, privatizing natural resources and let foreign investors buy all of it .. etc. )

				Politics in the USA at least are just so corrupt it doesnt even matter who you vote for because all the candidates are controlled by big business. Until we have proportional representation or whatever its called when for example a party get 5% of the vote, they get 5% representation in government. In the US now we have a &quot;winner takes all&quot; system so a party that gets 51% of the votes gets 100% representation, despite almost half the country (49%) being opposed to that party. It makes it impossible for smaller parties to have any say at all.
