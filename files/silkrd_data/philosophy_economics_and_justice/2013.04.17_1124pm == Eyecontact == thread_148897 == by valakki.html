				How much do you do it? With your co workers? People on the bus or street? Family members? Lovers? <br />Do you try to look into everyone`s eye? What is the norm: lots of eye contact or just a few scattered here and there?&nbsp; <br /><br />i want to know what you ppl think. Because for me, every eye contact is a journey and every single time I learn something about the person.<br />Its a wonderful experience, but sometimes I feel like its not appropriate!<br /><br />Write down your thoughts!!<br />

				You should give eye contact to every person you talk to, show&#039;s you mean business and you don&#039;t fuck around. Get bitches wet as fuck, if you are fairly attractive, makes people respect you no matter what you look like.

By rights you shouldn&#039;t have to look someone dead in their eye to the point of staring in order for them to treat you the same way they would if you hadn&#039;t, but often you do. If you are dealing with a retailer or cashier for a refund, or someone who is just basically dodgy, it helps to look them directly in their eye so they understand you<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=148897.msg1025717#msg1025717">Quote from: thereefers245 on April 17, 2013, 11:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">...mean business and you don&#039;t fuck around...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />It&#039;s basic 101 for dealing with shits.<br /><br />Co-workers typically yes but depends on situation, staring never helps but a good amount of eye-contact is necessary to co-exist in the same area for a few hours every day.<br /><br />I would leave eye-contact alone with people on the bus or street unless you need to keep an eye on them as some may find that confrontational (like me 8) ). I don&#039;t like people staring at me unless I give them permission to lol ::) . In my xp I have found that most people who use eye-contact for no reason to the point of staring at you on the street, generally are seedy people wanting to ask you for money or some other scam. Or just lower class in general.<br /><br />I think it is necessary for family members to actually look at each other from time to time. <br /><br />Mmm........ I don&#039;t think you can be a lover without a good amount of eye-contact, I think it&#039;s only natural. You tend to like your wife (or girlfriend) more than others so usually they receive more eye contact. ::) :-*<br /><br />The norm of maintaining eye-contact differs according to who concerned. If somebody is running at you with a butcher knife then it is probably a good idea to look at them fully. (For obvious reasons.) <br /><br />Of course you learn something from someone through eye-contact, it can sometimes provide a good heads up before actually engaging on conversation with them. I don&#039;t think it is enough for it to be a journey though.<br /><br />Finally, it&#039;s not appropriate to engage in eye-contact if you have no reason to. If someone is passing you in the supermarket aisle don&#039;t enter into a fucking mystical journey into their eyes as they are just there to shop.<br /><br />................................. &gt;:D&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;::)<br /><br />Piece, Love, and Fuck Haters.

				I find eye contact to be rather awkward. I mean, I make eye contact, but to me it seems almost like a foreign language.

				I use eye contact when I want to dominate someones mind. This has been a fact for me. When I use eye contact on a male it&#039;s like I&#039;m fighting him mentally. Either he will get intimidated or he will get pissed off. Depends who is more of a man. People who abuse their power over other, if you stare into their eyes will always look away as they are cowards. <br />I will stare into a women&#039;s eyes to show a sort of dominance and also when women see you looking into their eyes they really think you are admiring them and really listening to what they are saying, so yes, they get wet as fuck.<br /><br />Chaos

This is actually an old sales tactic, social psychology from way back when. If you want to put someone at ease you (subtly) mimic their body language, including blinking rate, breathing rate, and eye contact. You&#039;d think this would unnerve them but no, it puts them at ease.<br /><br />But there&#039;s eye contact with people you&#039;re talking to, and there&#039;s eye contact with people you&#039;re encountering outside of conversation (passing in stores, on the subway/train/bus, on the street). Eye contact is an invitation to engage, positively or negatively. Like personal space, it definitely seems to vary according to place and context. On the subway at night, maybe you don&#039;t make eye contact with anybody, but at work, you visually acknowledge strangers who pass you in the hall. Or if you&#039;re from a culture where directness can be disrespectful, maybe you mostly avoid eye contact at all. That&#039;s a thing that&#039;s changed in witness evaluations over the years, because assumptions may not carry across cultures.<br /><br />As for me, I remember going through a period of extreme self-doubt in which I met the gaze of no one that I wasn&#039;t talking to. The day I shook off the doubt was the day I started looking strangers in the eye again, and realized what I&#039;d been doing.

It&#039;s probably because I&#039;m borderline aspie - it&#039;s one of the indicators, and I score high on autism tests (so do my cousins, and one has Asperger&#039;s), amongst other things. Possibly you are too....&nbsp; ???<br /><br />That said, I do make an effort to remember to make eye-contact as it is essential. It does take an effort though....&nbsp; :-[

				I will be honest. I could not be bothered reading all the other posts.<br /><br />Here is my 2 bits though.<br /><br />Giving a person eye contact, is in most cases giving them respect. For instance if you meat somebody and shake hands. If the other person is looking away my first impression of him/her is often that they are imature.

				Again, it&#039;s all confidence. Look the cop in the eye, but don&#039;t stare him down. Be relaxed, don&#039;t think, &quot;oh shit I&#039;m going to jail&quot;, think &quot;this guy is wasting my time, lets get this done so I can go home.&quot; If you are guilty it is all in your face.

You do not need to pick a fight with a cop in order to maintain your dignity.

I was just about to put a load of other stuff, but I realized it might incriminate me, so I&#039;ll just say it wasn&#039;t looking in his eye that got him to search me, it was my cheeky demeanor; he asked why I thought I was stopped, so I said it was cause I had crazy colored hair! He thought I was being cheeky and after they searched me (I wasn&#039;t carrying) made up some bullshit about painkillers in my handbag, but shit - every person also being pulled over and searched was wearing a hoodie, had skate sneakers, had crazy hair etc. - you trying to tell me no old white guys in suits had any painkillers on them?! And FFS - peeps in suits are some of the biggest drug users on the planet, they love their coke! Dogs are just an excuse to search &#039;suspicious&#039; people, so now when I carry I look as respectable as I can - dress conservative and wear a cross!

I was just about to put a load of other stuff, but I realized it might incriminate me, so I&#039;ll just say it wasn&#039;t looking in his eye that got him to search me, it was my cheeky demeanor; he asked why I thought I was stopped, so I said it was cause I had crazy colored hair! He thought I was being cheeky and after they searched me (I wasn&#039;t carrying) made up some bullshit about painkillers in my handbag, but shit - every person also being pulled over and searched was wearing a hoodie, had skate sneakers, had crazy hair etc. - you trying to tell me no old white guys in suits had any painkillers on them?! And FFS - peeps in suits are some of the biggest drug users on the planet, they love their coke!

Everyone&#039;s doing meth. It&#039;s insane that the most hardcore druggies are also the people holding up the economy. I never get searched as I wear a suit.

This has been a fact for me. When I use eye contact on a male it&#039;s like I&#039;m fighting him mentally. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is an archtypeal trait of a psychopath. They see everything as a competition, a game they have to win - and others are their competitors. Mainstream psychiatry has known for&nbsp; a fact that around 3-4 % of the population are psychopaths. This is a mainstream scientific fact. Don&#039;t trust my words - do your own research. The thing is that the vast majority of people think of psychopath as being the maniacal murderers like Ted Bundy or Charles Manson. This is a grave mistake - most of the psychopaths are well adjusted and blend in perfectly, almost too perfectly&nbsp; with the rest of the population. Incidentally most of them end up in the positions of power (the more intelligent ones) such as politics,&nbsp; banking, army or any other position where they can dominate others without having to be explicitly held accountable for it. <br /><br />I am not saying that you are a psychopath Chaos. I do not have enough evidence to prove this. And I am not meaning to be insulting in anyway. I have used your quote to get down to the main idea that I wanted to channel and hear other people&#039;s opinions, thoughts, and comments. <br /><br />Without further complicating this matter - I use eye contact frequently and especially in certain situation when I want to show the respect to the other person, but there are main variations on the theme here so I will stop and ask my question:<br /><br />Have you ever experienced people intensively looking you in the eyes, not strangers necessarily, in most instances it would be people familiar with you one why or the other; only to feel emotionally drained afterwards, as if you&#039;re energy and life force has been somehow sucked out of you?<br /><br />This is what psychopaths do - in essence they are like vampires, feeding off the peoples positive energy and spreading the negative. They rarely blink when you look them in the eye - normal humans blink on average 5-10 times a minute. The highly intelligent psychopaths can even imitate this, blink intentionally if they suspect that you might be on to something.<br /><br />There are quite a few books on this matter with vast amount of scientific evidence, so far I have read two excellent books written by trained psychiatrist specializing in psychopathy: <br /><br />&quot;Without Empathy&quot; and &quot;Psychopath Next Door&quot;<br /><br />The funny thing is that I went all my adult life thinking that evil doesn&#039;t exist - apparently it does and it is pure and genuine - and one in 25 people is the Devil&#039;s incarnate if you will, because psychopathy is not a psychological condition - it is a biological trait and there is no treatment or cure for it.&nbsp; Something to think about - &quot;The greatest&nbsp; trick devil ever pulled was convincing us he didn&#039;t exist&quot;....<br /><br />Peace,<br /><br /><br />
