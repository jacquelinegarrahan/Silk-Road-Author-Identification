				Taken from Chris Spivey - http://www.chrisspivey.co.uk - *Clearnet*<br /><br />Right, fasten your seat belts… Iv’e given myself the right fucking hump.<br /><br />For years, I have been telling anyone who will listen that the threat of terrorism is a government hoax specifically designed to keep people living in fear.<br /><br />A frightened population is a sure fire way to get people to do a governments bidding.&nbsp; Frightened people will gladly give up their civil liberty’s and agree to almost anything in exchange for perceived safety… Fucking mugs.<br /><br />So, do you feel any safer after allowing the country to become a virtual police state?<br /><br />Only a brain dead moron would answer yes to that question.<br /><br />The truth is, there never was any fucking danger.<br /><br />You have all sold yourselves down the pan on a shit load of&nbsp; government lies.<br /><br />Any terrorist threat or attack&nbsp; that has taken place in this country since the turn of the century has been carried out by our governments past and present.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;The government are the terrorists… Full stop.<br /><br />Any terrorist plots that we are told have been uncovered or thwarted are plots dreamt up by the government… Full stop.<br /><br />The big bad terrorists who want to kill you are nothing more than the figments of the evil, corrupt British &amp; American governments imagination… And what a limited imagination the twisted, warped minded cunts have.<br /><br />Luckily for them, the Westminster Puppet Show and the Wankers of Washington have the all powerful MSM propaganda machine at their disposal, actively brainwashing our heavily sedated populations who lack slightly less in imagination than their scaremongering governments.<br /><br />In America – a country with realistically the same odds as the UK (if not higher), of suffering a terrorist attack – the odds of being killed as a result of terrorism are 20,000,000 to 1… For you thick fuckers, that’s Twenty Million to One.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />To put that in number in context, the odds of you dying in a car crash are 108 to 1… Best you never get in a fucking car again.<br /><br />The odds of you drowning are 1,112 to 1… Compare the digits 1,112 against 20,000,000<br /><br />Best you never ever again get a bath or even so much as dip your toe in the local swimming pool. As for going on holiday, fuck that dangerous shit… Yet, I don’t see the Cunt Cameron calling an emergency meeting of the Water Wings Council, do you?<br /><br />I mean, you would have to die by drowning 17985 (seventeen thousand, nine hundred and eighty five) times before being blown up by a terrorist bomb… Come here, bend over and let me kick you repeatedly up the fucking arse.<br /><br />Another way of looking at the chances of being killed by a terrorist is you would have to be fatally struck by lightning 159 times before being turned into offal by a mush in a bomber jacket.<br /><br />Or,&nbsp; killed by a dog at least a 164 times… Best you never ever, never ever, ever again go out in a thunder storm or stroke a dog… Dangerous fucking shit, at best. SOURCE<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Yet the vast majority of the population fall for the government terrorist con.<br /><br />And, make no mistake, it is a government con, designed to make Trillions of fucking pounds for their corporate masters via wars, arms deals and oil… Not forgetting the profits from the Afghan drug trade<br /><br />Worse still, the none existent threat of a terrorist attack is put in place to enslave you.&nbsp; And you thick cunts are so petrified by the prospect of being a victim of terrorism that you symbolically hold your wrists forwards and allow yourselves to be manacled… No fucking flies on you right minded cunts, are there.<br /><br />Yet go on the Government’s Anti Terrorist website and you are immediately greeted by the words:<br /><br />The threat to the UK and our interests from international terrorism is substantial. This means that there is a strong possibility of a terrorist attack, and an attack may occur without warning. SOURCE<br /><br />SUBSTANTIAL… SUBFUCKINGSTANTIAL… Twenty million to One! Substantial?<br /><br />Fuck me! Even as I’m writing this the BBC are reporting that the US state department has issued a global travel alert because of an unspecified al-Qaeda threat. SOURCE<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Its all fucking bollocks, people.<br /><br />An” unspecified al-Qaeda threat”?<br /><br />If they don’t know what the threat is how can they issue a global fucking travel alert?<br /><br />You might just as well travel because the unspecified threat may be a car bomb parked outside your fucking house.<br /><br />And, if they do know what the threat is but they aren’t saying, what was the fucking point in panicking the public in the first fucking place.<br /><br />Its like saying to someone; “I could tell you something but I won’t”.<br /><br />The reason that the threat is unspecified is because it only exists inside their pathetic, hate filled, warmongering minds.<br /><br />The scheming, dirty, sick vermin in the MSM and corrupt, warped, sexual deviants in power make me want to fucking puke.<br /><br />Are you people mental defectives?<br /><br />Why the fuck are you putting up with these corrupt, lying, sick, gusset sniffers elected by yourselves?<br /><br />According to the Daily Mail – a useless MSM newspaper and government propaganda machine – between 2002 and 2010 the illegal, sickening and unwarranted invasions/occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan have cost the British tax payer £20 Billion pounds. SOURCE<br /><br />Twenty billion quid is easy to say, but try fucking counting it.<br /><br />Moreover, going on that figure, the cost of our governments brutality to date has to easily be somewhere around the £25-£30 Billion pound mark.<br /><br />And since that figure of £20 billion was printed in a government propaganda outlet, you just know that the real figure is far higher.<br /><br />And for what?<br /><br />For those sick psychopathic pervert Wank-Stains to get fucking richer?&nbsp; To murder and maim millions of innocent people whilst causing millions more untold suffering.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />And neither do we here in the UK and USA escape the consequences of our governments crimes against humanity.<br /><br />We are all systematically and quite deliberately, being plunged into a life of poverty and un-payable debt based purely on the premise of what is in reality, a non existent threat on our lives.<br /><br />If I am being honest, I don’t know who is sicker; the government for continuing their warped agenda or the vast majority of the British public for their pathetic lack of backbone, passion and brains.<br /><br />I am fucking sick to death of hearing gullible, gung-ho, partisan, morons championing our troops and hailing them as fucking heroes… These cretinous Chimps are almost on a par with the retarded, Royal worshipping, plastic flag wavers.<br /><br />Any British soldier – or whatever their nationality for that matter – taking on the role of Mercenary in Afghanistan or Iraq is most definitely not a hero, you thick fucks.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />“But the Soldiers have no choice in the matter Spiv”.<br /><br />There is always a choice. In this case, the harder of the two is the choice a real hero would make.<br /><br />The fact that they make the wrong choice confirms to me that they are armed and fucking dangerous brainless robots,who will be shooting you and your fucking family on the streets of Britain in the none too distant future, if you don’t get your fucking acts together very fucking soon.<br /><br />Heroes are not men and women who invade a foreign country and randomly slaughter millions of innocent men women and children, all in the name of&nbsp; Queen and Country, just because they are told to.<br /><br />The Queen is a cunt and not one single soldier is fighting for this retard infested, fucked up country… I don’t back morons and I don’t back murderers and above all, I do not back any cunt who is contributing to mine and my family’s demise – Be it knowingly or unwittingly.<br /><br />I’m sure that the truth will upset some cunts… I fucking hope so anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />And what of the cost?<br /><br />The cost of protecting the country from a twenty million to one, none existent threat is around £4 Billion pounds a year and rising. SOURCE<br /><br />Think about that… Four Billion fucking pounds wasted when you have&nbsp; more chance of being killed by a Fireman… Wait for it… Fifty Eight Thousand, Eight Hundred and Twenty Three fucking times.<br /><br />If your house catches fire, grab a fucking bucket and whatever you do, don’t dial 999. Those pesky Firemen are 58823 times more likely to see you dead than Osama Bin Ladens mob are.<br /><br />Excuse me while I shout.<br /><br />AND YOU LET THOSE EVIL CUNTS PRETENDING TO BE ACTING IN YOUR BEST INTERESTS GET AWAY WITH IT? … AND YOU CUNTS CONSIDER YOURSELVES QUALIFIED TO FUCKING VOTE?<br /><br />Unbelievable!<br /><br /><br /><br />“Hold up Spiv! What has Idiot Dickhead Smiff got to do with terrorism?”<br /><br />Fuck all, I just like humiliating the useless cunt.<br /><br />“Fair play. Carry on”.<br /><br />The Security Services have just had their annual budget raised by THREE fucking times above the rate of inflation, with the government justifying the increase on the back of the Woolwich terrorist attack.<br /><br />Let me tell you about that terrorist attack that was perpetrated by the British Security Services with the full participation of our dishonourable Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, the Mayor of London, the MP for Greenwich &amp;Woolwich (who is married to the shadow Secretary of Defence), the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the Head of MI5… And you think radical Muslims are dangerous???<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />It is in fact a toss up between which false flag terrorist attack was more transparent; the USA’s or the UK’s.<br /><br />I mean, it wouldn’t surprise me if the two governments had bet against each other as to who could drop the most clues and still get away with it.<br /><br />To be fair, the Americans did make us look amateurish at amateur dramatics.<br /><br />Fair enough, our governments attempt had videos of undercover coppers destroying the crime scene, actresses pretending to be French and controlled explosions without the bomb squad taking part.<br /><br />The Boston bomb though was in an altogether different class. You had a terrorist putting a bomb in a bag and lowering it onto the pavement on the end of a pipe after first manoeuvring the bag on the end of the pipe between a pair of spectators legs.<br /><br />“Whats that Lyn”?<br /><br />“Oh, its just someone wanting to put a bomb in a bag onto the pavement in front of us. Ignore him Honey, and watch the runners”.<br /><br />You had a dead woman being given oxygen.<br /><br />You had a bomb go off before the casualties arrived and a joke of a cowboy who told the world that the bomb was so powerful that it blew the long line of flags away, when it clearly didn’t.<br /><br />It was however one of those smart bombs that can blow a persons legs off but leave the person standing next to them unscathed.<br /><br />Carlos the cowboy then tells us how he leapt into action to put out the flames on Jeff Bauman – whose false stump fell off as he was being wheeled away – when the photo evidence clearly shows the lying cunt leaning against a fence waiting for Bauman to be carried into place.<br /><br />And that nowhere near completes the list of fuck ups… Fucking brilliant though, because that many dopey cunts still fell for it that Boom Boom Bauman had at least $3.8 Million dollars donated to him.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Now, with so many sleepwalkers, all&nbsp; hopelessly indoctrinated in the ways of the arse about face world we live in – and totally unable to see the wood for the trees – I get called a deluded,egotistical cunt on a daily basis because of what I write.<br /><br />Mind you, more often than not, these rectal warts will go on to inform me that I write total shit anyway.<br /><br />Course, quite how these dung funnel tunnel torpedoes reach that conclusion must be fascinating to hear since the vast majority do not have the attention span to read in full, the indisputable evidence that I present to them.<br /><br />And even when they do, the goldfish brained fuck wits, don’t have the intelligence to process the information let alone try and de-construct it.<br /><br />Not one of the hundreds of people with brains the size of a eunuchs gonads, who call me a mad, delusional, egotistical cunt on here – or elsewhere – has ever even attempted to take apart the evidence that I present for Woolwich &amp; Boston being false flags… And yet they think its me whose the mad Cunt!<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Oh how the government must chuckle and rub their hands in glee at the crass stupidity of a nation living in fear of a threat that does not exist.<br /><br />No fucking wonder the piss taking arseholes don’t even try to make their false flag operations credible any more.<br /><br />Fuck me, even when presented with indisputable proof of a false flag terrorist attack, the spineless, emotionally crippled, nanny state dependent, forelock tugging yokels don’t bat an eyelid.<br /><br />I mean,&nbsp; it was only a few weeks ago that the New York Police Department released toxic gases on non-consenting guinea pig citizens in what was touted as being a subway ‘attack drill’.<br /><br />Just like that, without a murmur of disapproval, the NYPD used poisonous gas on their fellow human beings without the victims even knowing about it.<br /><br />And why did the NYPD do this… And I really, really am trying not to laugh here as I type.<br /><br />They used poisonous gas on their fellow human beings under the preposterous mandate of assessing the danger to human life should terrorists release poisonous gas in the subway… You could not make that shit up in a trillion billion million years.<br /><br />Don’t believe me?<br />

				The article is printed in full lower down this page.<br /><br />Are American citizens thick as fuck for letting the authorities get away with it?<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Well, ignorance is bliss I suppose.<br /><br />Course, the British authorities did the exact&nbsp; same thing to their citizens on the London Underground. Only difference was, the BBC notified the public of the intention to do so… So, if the Americans are thick as fuck for having no choice in the matter. What does that say about us Brits who were given advanced notice.<br /><br />And all done under the guise of protecting the fucking public.<br /><br />Did the authorities need to do it?<br /><br />Why would they need to when they can collect the data from the Sarin gas attack on the Japanese subway system that took place on March 20, 1995. SOURCE<br /><br />Why did they need people in the stations anyway?<br /><br />Now here’s a thought. Perhaps the US &amp; UK drill’s had a much more sinister&nbsp; purpose behind them… Nah, the government would never do anything like that would they?<br /><br />They did it because they need to know how to protect us from those over active terrorist’s, don’t cha know.<br /><br />Course, you do know that I’m a terrorist according to the government, don’t you? In fact, I think you will find that the Anti-terrorist laws brought about, supposedly as a direct result of 9/11 – although they were drafted long before – were specifically written with people like me in mind.<br /><br />Homeland terrorists is the title we have had bestowed on us… And I don’t even have a fucking beard.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />This would explain why I have had plain clothed policemen knock on my door at least twice to my knowledge.<br /><br />They could have knocked a lot more for all I know.<br /><br />After all, my doorbell gets rung at least once or twice a day by some unidentified mush or other, don’t cha know.<br /><br />However, since I only ever answer my door to those who I am expecting, it could be anyone knocking… I can never be arsed to get up and have a nose to be honest.<br /><br />Never the less, being as the two times that I know about for definite (it would take too long to explain how I know) occurred in late May, early June and the anti-terrorist squad haven’t come crashing through my door to arrest me, I can only conclude that they only wanted a friendly word in my shell like – no doubt about the stuff&nbsp; that I write about on here.<br /><br />Now, there are two reasons that I mention this.<br /><br />The first reason – which is more of a minor irritation than a problem – highlights the frustrating, crass stupidity of people and the frightening extent of&nbsp; political indoctrination prevalent in the minuscule minds of the masses.<br /><br />You see, me mentioning the plain clothed officers will get those pathetic cunts who dismiss me as a mad, deluded, egotistical cunt, who can’t write for shit, scampering back to their forums, where they will type something along the lines of; “I see Spivey is that full of himself that he thinks he is important enough for the Security Services to keep tabs on him. What stone do these madmen crawl out from under”.<br /><br />Course, the Irony there is that these retarded smegheads obviously hang on to my every word just so as they can go back to their little forums and run me down without realising just how pathetic they make themselves sound.<br /><br />Mind you, their often nonsensical attempts to discredit me usually lead to an influx of new visitors which can only be a good thing.<br /><br />In turn, with me having just said that, the semi literate cunts will now spend more time trying to get a comment passed on here… These mugs are so predictable.<br /><br />This literary masterpiece will say something along the lines of ; “Spivy ur a cunt whatch ur bask cos were gonna&nbsp; get u your sick fucker!!! u need two take off ur tinfoil hat ya mug!!!”.<br /><br />When Carl just presses the delete button, they will then take the time to email me, accusing me of being too scared to print their comment because I obviously only allow comments that ‘big me up’… I occasionally get the urge to email them back and inform them that they are confusing my comment policy with that of John Ward’s over at the Slog (See what I did there?) but I never do.<br /><br />I occasionally inform them that if they submit a legible comment, polite in content, which puts forward a credible counter argument to what I say, they stand every chance of getting their comment published… But they never take my advice.<br /><br />Obviously, the fact that they deem me so worthy of so much of their time yet think me mad to believe that MI5 monitor everything I do goes straight over their heads.<br /><br />In the meantime, the government announce more&nbsp; new measures to make these stupid cunts sad little lives that little bit more harder.<br /><br />Now I hate to say it, but we all know that MI5&nbsp; know every move I make and can probably recite ‘the Drummer man’, ‘the camera never lies’ and ‘Monsters Inc’ word for word’.<br /><br />In fact, let me give the Plebs of Plebington hard-ons by saying that I imagine MI5 are kicking themselves for not taking me out of the game when I was half as popular as I am now.<br /><br />Still, as far as I am concerned those spastics can waste as much typing time as they like calling me a cunt. After all, it is blatantly obvious who the real cunts are. In fact, If brains were dynamite they wouldn’t be able to scorch the inside of their skulls.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Course, in reality, any cunt who chooses to do the shit I do just so as a handful of people will ‘big them up’ most certainly needs a designer tinfoil hat… Mine, in reality is just a drawn on tin foil hat… I don’t do hats of any kind as a general rule.<br /><br />The hours are proper shit, the pay is even shittier than the hours, you live with the knowledge that the authorities are waiting to pounce, and the only reason my bollocks are perceived as being so big is that I haven’t had the time over the past year to find myself a girlfriend.<br /><br />Furthermore, for every person who wants to shake my hand there are three others who want to rip my fucking head off.<br /><br />But apparently, its all worthwhile because a handful of you will tell me that I’m the tits… Which I could get told by a lot more people just by continuing to tattoo – a job which requires considerably less hours, is extremely more lucrative, involves no men in suits lining up to put a bullet in my head and everyone is keen to shake my hand.<br /><br />The second reason for mentioning the above and the one that does bother me greatly is the fact that there is so much apathy amongst the tens of thousands of people who visit this site and are in fact, able to think for themselves.<br /><br />You really need to up your game people.<br /><br />You see, despite what the Plebs of Plebington may think, I’m really not interested in reading comments about the huge size of my bollocks.<br /><br />All I want from you is for you to get fucking angry.<br /><br />I mean, you know just as well as I do that we are all being taken for cunts. You also know as well as I do what the end game is… So why are there only forty, maybe fifty or so people who visit this site that appear to have any backbone?<br /><br />Am I to believe that those fifty or so people are the only ones to make up the half a million visitors I get on here every month?<br /><br />Half a million visits per month is a huge number. Certainly a lot, lot more than I ever imagined yet the silence is fucking deafening.<br /><br />Where is the outrage and anger?<br /><br />Or do you all want to either end up dead or living a life of abject poverty, misery and servitude?<br /><br />Fuck me, you are not idiots. It is blatantly obvious now that if all else fails there is going to be a third world war.<br /><br />And, I’m pretty fucking sure that you know that staying quiet will not save you.<br /><br /><br /><br />The truth is, staying quiet and accepting your fate makes you worse than the know nothing nancy boys &amp; girls.<br /><br />I don’t want to be your hero, especially not your dead hero.<br /><br />I want you to be my heroes.<br /><br />The time to step up is now… Lets go to fucking war.<br /><br /><br />NYPD releases toxic gases on non-consenting guinea pig citizens in subway ‘attack drill’<br /><br />Friday, July 12, 2013 by: Jonathan Benson, staff writer<br />Tags: gas attack, subway system, police drill<br /><br />Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/041169_gas_attack_subway_system_police_drill.html#ixzz2alSAigUW<br /><br />(NaturalNews) You may not have heard much of anything about it, but millions of New Yorkers who use the Big Apple’s underground public transit system recently become the victims of a major chemical attack — no, not an attack by some unknown terrorist cell from the Middle East, but one initiated by the New York Police Department (NYPD).<br /><br />According to new reports, the NYPD, in conjunction with a prominent federally-run laboratory, blasted plumes of a chemical gas known to cause respiratory problems and lung injury into the New York City subway system as part of a coordinated “attack drill.” The purpose of the drill, as officially stated, was to assess how terrorists might try to disburse more harmful chemicals into a public place as part of a future biological attack.<br /><br />After placing a number of air-sampling devices both inside subway tunnels and at ground-level entryways all around the city, NYPD officers working together with officials from the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island proceeded to pump tracer gases known as perfluorocarbons into subway tunnels during people’s morning commute. They then tested how the gases spread throughout the day.<br /><br />NBC New York explains that the chemical gas, which is derived from the waste of aluminum processing plants, was sprayed into subway tunnels at such low concentrations that nobody was expected to become injured by them, at least according to the so-called experts. In fact, most of the mainstream media sources reporting the story have declared the gas to be “safe.”<br /><br />PFCs linked to a host of chronic health problems in humans<br /><br />But numerous safety data sheets on perfluorocarbons tell a much different story, as do various studies that have evaluated the chemical’s effects on mammals over the years. As it turns out, perfluorocarbons have been shown in at least one randomized trial to cause respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and other health problems when inhaled.<br /><br />Other studies have linked perfluorocarbon exposure to early menopause in women, as well as endocrine disruption, liver damage, reproductive problems, and cancer in the general population. The chemical is also exceptionally pervasive, and a major contributor to greenhouse gas buildup in the atmosphere.<br /><br />And yet both the NYPD and the Department of Justice (DOJ), which heavily backed the project, continue to insist that people’s worries are unwarranted. Concentrations of perfluorocarbon used in the study were too low to cause harm, they claim. And once the gas mixes with the general atmosphere, it will be virtually undetectable, or so goes the argument.<br /><br />$3.4 million study conducted for no specific reason, admits police commissioner<br /><br />Interestingly, funding for the study came from taxpayers in the form of a $3.4 million federal grant, which was apparently given for no specific reason. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, as quoted by NBC New York, told the media that “there was no specific event” that led up to the study, and that it is just part of the “overall plan to help protect the city.”<br /><br />With massive unemployment and ever-tightening budgets, $3.4 million is quite a bit of money for the federal government to just hand out on a whim to pump fluoride-based chemical gases into subway tunnels. There appears to be a much more sinister agenda at work here, and it is one where the people being exposed to the chemicals involved do not get much of a choice in whether or not to participate.<br /><br />“I object to the fact that there have not been any public hearings on the health and environmental risks of perfluorocarbons, which are also greenhouse gases,” explains an “I Do Not Consent” letter posted at WashingtonSquareParkBlog.com. “I object to the fact that the names of the specific 7 perfluorocarbons to be used will not be made public.”<br /><br />Sources for this article include:<br /><br />http://www.myfoxny.com<br /><br />http://www.nbcnewyork.com<br /><br />http://www.ec.gc.ca<br /><br />http://washingtonsquareparkblog.com<br /><br />Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/041169_gas_attack_subway_system_police_drill.html#ixzz2alQH4VZP<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Gas to be released on Underground to test fallout<br /><br />14 June 2013<br /><br />Up to 40 stations are being monitored for the gases<br />Continue reading the main story<br />Related Stories<br />Terror gas exercises to be held<br />Tests are set to be carried out on the London Underground to see how quickly poisonous gases could spread across the Tube network.<br /><br />The aim is to create a better understanding of how to respond in the event of them being deliberately or accidentally released.<br /><br />The trials will be carried out over several days this month using non-hazardous materials.<br /><br />The gases will be released between the morning and evening peak times.<br /><br />Transport for London said the gas would be released near the opening of the tunnels and that people should not be able to see, smell or taste it.<br /><br />Eleven stations will be tested and a further 30-40 stations will be monitored to check how the gas has moved through them.<br /><br />Nigel Holness, operations director of London Underground (LU), said a similar trial was carried out, at St John’s Wood station, in 2007.<br /><br />He said the tests were being carried out by the Department of Transport.<br /><br />“We’ll be working with the department to take the results, make sure we feed them into our plans to make sure we have the most safe and secure plans for London Underground and London,” he added.<br /><br />Stations where the gases are to be released are:<br /><br />Pimlico<br />Westminster<br />Oxford Circus<br />Tottenham Hale<br />Green Park<br />Holborn<br />King’s Cross St. Pancras<br />London Bridge<br />Goodge Street<br />Leicester Square<br />Piccadilly Circus<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This article was NOT written by me, rather i came across it while looking for answers. <br /><br />http://www.chrisspivey.co.uk - clearnet
