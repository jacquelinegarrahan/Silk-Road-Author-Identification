				Americans are consitutionally paranoid. I don&#039;t like the Left, but I like Chomsky&#039;s insights sometimes. He made the point in the 70s when discussing the policy of &#039;free fire zones&#039; in Vietnam and how the War became a scalphunting expedition that Americans are the most secure people who have ever lived yet are also the most paranoid. The American is a guy who raises a posse of massively armed men to torch a basically insignificant Comanche village while screaming that everyone is trying to murder him and he&#039;s acting in self-defense <br /><br />About a hundred thousand people apparently died in Syria over the last 24 odd months, but Syrians are by all accounts trying to go on with normal life. In America, a skyscraper gets taken down in NYC, a couple thousand people die, suddenly a million idiots in Texas build bunkers, demand genocide, and scream in terror that everyone is trying to kill them <br /><br />American society is anarchic while simultaneously being highly authoritarian

				americans ARE paranoid as a species. and locked and loaded as well. and under the influence. and armed with the wrong information. and righteously indignant and fundamentalistic! quick to fire, slow to hear ya. and very very sure that they are entitled, and correct in all opinion. and loud. theyre very loud. theyre for the most part dangerous, in multiple ways. but they dont see this about themselves, and huff and puff if faced with it. they think theyre the good guys, they really believe this, and are confused that the world doesnt view them as such. in fact they think most of the world DOES view them as such, and are damn proud of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; i could go on......

It seems to be a classic stereotype for Americans, but what&#039;s wrong with getting along with everyone else in the Land of the Free? (Land of the &quot;Free&quot;) Does no one see the problems with the &quot;fuck everyone else&quot; mentality, that you only got your friends because at one time you decided not to include those strangers in the &quot;everyone else&quot; part of that phrase?<br /><br />I&#039;m glad for people.
