				Controlling the masses is as old an idea as time itself.<br />Given that fact into the equation im guessing pretty much anything is possible.<br />I would love to hear what thoughts anyone has on this subject, be it funny, bizarre or just out right out there.

				Bilderberg , Zionists, Rothschilds. <br />Any other group who is thought to control is indirectly controlled by one of the above groups.<br />Well as far as my limited research into this goes, that&#039;s what I&#039;m going by.

				Being in europe i an very aware of the name Rothschilds, they are practically burned into our historic memory.<br />As for the other two, i have heard of them but am not entirely sure as to what they are about.<br />Going to look into it though now.

				That&#039;s a good question you ask Adasel. Of course, there is no easy answer to it. <br /><br />I realise an opinion is only an opinion, so I am not claiming that my thoughts here are fact. In my humble opinion, there are an elite bunch of people in the World and they control what really goes on in the World. Between them, they own more than half of the World&#039;s wealth. They are silent, but primary shareholders in most of the major industries in the World, such as the pharmaceutical, oil, food industry etc. Families in this elite group include the likes of the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Kennedys, Russells etc. They control most of the banks in the World and this global recession is orchestrated by them. They are more powerful than the US Government, and I think they actually control the US President. The US Government are in serious debt to the Federal Reserve. Guess what, the Rothschilds own the Federal Reserve. The name is rather misleading eh?!! One would be forgiven for thinking it was a Government bank. If you become indebted to someone, you become their servant. This is how the US Government is controlled, and in essence, that is how the masses are controlled.<br /><br />Between the bloodlines I mentioned earlier, they own all the mainstream media sources and they dictate what is fed to us in the news. That, is in itself, a way of controlling the masses. You&#039;d have to do some outside research to find out what is really going on in the World. Take for example, the 9/11 atrocity in the U.S. There is more and more evidence stacking up to show that the attack on the World Trade Center was actually carried out by the Americans themselves. Have you ever heard of what happened to WTC building 7? This building collapsed/exploded at 5.20pm on the day of the attack, but no one ever heard about that in the mainstream news. This building landed in its own footprint when the explosion happened, which experts claim, could only happen if a controlled demolition was carried out. This was purposefully left out of the news because it would have had people asking questions. This is a control measure. <br /><br />The internet has provided a huge platform for people to find information for themselves. This has led people to become enlightened as to what is really going in the World and it has also highlighted what mainstream media had been keeping from us all this time.<br /><br />People are becoming more and more enlightened every day. Eventually, they will get fed up of the control they are under and I think there will be a huge revolution. People are fed up of the bull shit that they are being fed on a day to day basis. Global politics is all an act and money is the only concern of most politicians.<br /><br />My ramblings here are brief, but look into it yourself and the stuff you will read about is frightening. I&#039;m going to end my post here or else i&#039;ll be here for the night talking about this stuff.

				The Illuminati mixed with willful ignorance of the masses.<br /><br />Once you research enough and do enough mind altering substances, its pretty easy to see the reasons behind all major influences on humanity. Its all to get us to a specific point.<br /><br />Most people wont leave the comfort of assumption that nothing is wrong and everything bad happens because of stupidty, poor people and accident, and thats fine. Knowing the future has become a bit of a burden for us paying attention.

				PGP Club!<br /><br />On a serious note, I would say it depends on what time frame you&#039;re referring to.<br /><br />If you&#039;re talking about right now this minute. The army, the police, the government. If you&#039;re talking over a few days/weeks/months, then it is memes. If you mean over years and decades, then it is the business cycle, interest rates, particularly investment allocations, and if you mean over many decades or centuries it is economics writ large with demographics/, and if you mean over thousands of years then it is biology, and if you&#039;re talking millions, billions of years, then it must be ultimately pgp club. <br />

				One word: Fear.<br /><br />I believe that fear is what controls the masses.&nbsp; Fear that something they do may harm them-fear they may get in trouble-fear they may suffer consequences that are unrealistic.&nbsp; For example, one of my best friend&#039;s who really only drinks and very rarely smokes has been very depressed lately-she&#039;s been through a lot and as her friend I am trying to be there for her, so I told her about MDMA and how it may benefit her in ways she can&#039;t even wrap her head around.&nbsp; After a long (and kinda aggravating) conversation, I could not get her to change her mind.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Fear.&nbsp; MDMA is an &quot;Illegal drug&quot; and she has the mentality that all illegal drugs will land you homeless on the street sucking dick for crack rocks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Strange example, but just one that I thought of on the top of my head.&nbsp; Her fear of becoming a drug addict is holding her back from taking a shot at responsible drug use which WOULD lead her to move on from what&#039;s been troubling her...if not move on, than at least be in peace with it.<br /><br />Now, there are different types of fear.&nbsp; I&#039;m putting my whole life on the line to do the business I conduct on SR and IRL-Do I live in fear everyday?&nbsp; YES!&nbsp; But, its a different kind of fear.&nbsp; I still do what I do very carefully, but there&#039;s always that thought in the back of my mind that the feds are going to come in and destroy my life and future, but I am willing to continue because I have full faith in the SR system and the people I fuck with-but then there are those who would never, ever embark on a venture as mine because that fear overwhelms them to the point that they are scared. <br /><br />tl;dr point is, if people weren&#039;t afraid to stand up for what they truly believe in their hearts, then this world would be a much different reality for all of us, but we are bounded by laws and injustice that keep us all just moving right along in the world, living day by day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Just my opinion, ever since I started doing the MDMA I&#039;ve gotten on SR I view this world in a totally different light.&nbsp; It&#039;s hard to explain, but I just don&#039;t understand how people just get born into this world, go to school, get a job, get married, start a family and then die-that just seems so pointless to me...sure, I may be doing the same thing but behind the scenes its a whole nether life I live, and I couldn&#039;t be happier.

				+1 for your you StExo, nice read :)<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if the question is really the right one.<br />Just in case there is an instance to be named, who really is controlling us, why we let do this with us? I think the question is just a feeling, that there is something we don&#039;t control or just something we don&#039;t understand. Most conspiracys are just a &#039;simple&#039; way to explain something very complex (e.g. finance system, politics, etc.). It&#039;s easy to spot on someone/something and make it the reason for everything what&#039;s wrong in our life/world.<br /><br />Based on my experience, there is one power which you can&#039;t break down or even control. It&#039;s love. As StExo gave as example, the love&nbsp; a mother has in her and shares with her kids and family, can&#039;t be described with words and most of the males will never be able to feel something similar &#039;extreme&#039;. I wouldn&#039;t agree on the point, that such mother will never think about such questions like, &#039;why am i here&#039; or similar &#039;deeper&#039; questions, because for many the love they&#039;re feeling is the possible answer. Besides the love of a mother, there are many kind of &#039;love&#039;, i think we all can reach the level of love we need for life, just by getting aware of our own. In current times, we&#039;re loosing the connection to ourselves and rushing after money, honor, boy/girlfriend or whatever (mostly materialistic) status symbols we&#039;re after. Imo, as soon we find the connections to ourselves again, it wouldn&#039;t even matter, if some rothschilds, illuminati, rosenkreuzer, free mansons, or whatever organizations really &#039;have the control&#039;, because it wouldn&#039;t affect us in a &#039;negative&#039; way.<br /><br />We should just build stable social groups, which can&#039;t be broken or shut down by anyone outstanding. Helping and loving each other.... that&#039;s it imo.... sounds so simple, but it&#039;s hard to make real. I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s hard to behave that natural.<br />Yes it&#039;s true, we&#039;re egoistic. But why not changing the point of view and realizing, that helping others, is helping ourselves, even if you&#039;re getting disappointed, it&#039;s just another experience in your life. It&#039;s up to us to rate it &#039;negative or &#039;positive&#039; OR to see it as it really is, just another event in the space-time continuum, we are allowed to watch.

				The capitalist class has the most control over your daily life.&nbsp; They decide how many workers are needed, in what industries, who is worthy of housing and food, and where the violence of the military&#039;s of nation states is needed.&nbsp; It is really not that complicated.&nbsp; For instance, if you are unemployed, there is no reason for you to be.&nbsp; There are enough resources to compensate you for work, and there are plenty of things that can be done that are beneficial to human comfort and survival.&nbsp; You are unemployed because nobody in the capitalist class currently needs your labor to obtain all the things they want to obtain.&nbsp; Everything else is secondary to the power of controlling the world&#039;s resources and the means of production.&nbsp; And to fend off any criticism of &quot;socialist&quot; states, I am not a state socialist.&nbsp; In fact there are no socialist nations, by the true definition of the word.&nbsp; I am a proponent of libertarian socialism, otherwise known as anarchist communism.&nbsp; If nobody can own the resources we all depend on then nobody can rise to a level of power that we all suffer underneath.&nbsp; To think we need sadistic bosses and politicians to force us to get off our lazy asses to do the jobs necessary for human survival is so pessimistic that if it were true, humans do not deserve to exist.&nbsp; Of course that is not true, we do all the things we need to do to survive outside of work,when we get home, such as gardening and building things, simply because we desire to.&nbsp; We will have more time to do the truly important tasks if we are not wasting time at jobs that are not necessary for bettering our lives, AND we will have more time to do the things that each of us desires, including enjoying more time with our friends and family.&nbsp; This world belongs to us all, we should all take it.&nbsp;

				I think mostly that planet Earth is just chaos.<br /><br />Some people have lots of money. Some people have lots of power. There are many companies, millions of them, with special interests, backhanders, bribes and corruption. There are many companies competing for market share, trying to manipulate people into buying their products or use their services. The same companies compete for government contracts. This is all in a constant state of flux as technology advances, nations change, ideologies change.. demand changes.. people die and new ones born. There are evil people that get into power and affect the world&#039;s economy and zeitgeist in many ways, and there are many people doing their best to stop that. There are career politicians who like to drink wine with Russian oligarchs and sit in the House of Lords. There are businesses that pander to this lifestyle and image, in exchange for reciprocal favour. There are countless ideologies interwoven into this massive construct of consumerism/trade/industry/military. <br /><br />And then you&#039;ve got the billions of us who live in different levels of class, from the very poor to the quite well-off, all trying to get by and survive, doing different things to earn money in this &quot;capital class&quot; system. I see what you mean redfun, but its very easy to say &quot;the capital class&quot; as if thats a definitive thing. I think that it&#039;s just a system we&#039;ve been born into, and it&#039;s composed of billions of people who wake up everyday and carry on on their way, in the world that we live in. I don&#039;t think they&#039;re conscious of it being malevolent, I just think they do what they will in this world. We were bred for it, remember. Is there a conspiracy in that, or did we just evolve this way? Do you think there is a guiding finger in all of this, a puppet master behind the curtain, or are we just a fucked up mammalian species who belong to a realm of abstract illusion?<br /><br />So basically I think it&#039;s just a massive confluence of events, of people of all different levels of greed and want, doing what they want and going for their own self interests.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think there is a conspiracy as such. No doubt there are very smart people in positions of vast wealth who use that power to create more wealth, to affect favourable policy, to keep the public from removing them from said position. But the ENTIRE WORLD, including ALL government policy EVERYWHERE, run by a single group? I doubt that. There are too many smaller business interests involved for that to be the case.

				&nbsp;:)<br />There are a real interesting mix of responses to the initial question, very interesting.<br />Some people have approached this from a Totally different perspective to others, but all the points raised have exhibited a high level of thought and contemplation<br />And questions like this should be asked;<br /><br />The truth is from my perspective (Highly Relative I know..haha)<br /><br />&nbsp;Is that we control ourselves, we are in ourselves free beings capable of living independently, but equally we thrive when living interdependently.<br />We are, as individuals. Capable of completely free thought, brilliant imagination and spectacular creativity.<br />&nbsp;BUT, we&#039;re tied down to a network of Systems, Old Traditions and Rules, The majority of which prohibit growth and excellence and instead promote greed and selfishness in all aspects of life..<br /><br />Such is the price of living in the &quot;civilized&quot; world being a &quot;person&quot; accepted by the relevant system in your country... <br />And to be fair, if had to describe the system using only one word, it would be difficult to decide between Power and Money...<br /><br />But, People CAN and DO live without control (I try to resist as much as possible, but still wish I was freer!). <br /><br />It&#039;s Just:<br />With the massive influx of information we are constantly bombarded with every day, most people are Heavily Influenced from an early age.<br />&nbsp;This allows for commonalities and Certain Mindsets to form which shape behavior not just in individuals but in groups, and once instilled these &quot;ways of thinking&quot; will cross generations..<br />&nbsp;We start to receive &quot;messages&quot; about our environment from an very early age and this persists throughout life; face to face, word of mouth, Mum, Dad, Family, Friends, hearsay, news, legend, advertisements, politicians, legislators etc etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;Whatever the Route Of Administration of all this data, we consume, assess (some more so than others) and then combine or discard.<br />and then for the most we just try and fit in.<br />We try to be like our fellow man, albeit with the influences which have stuck, always in the background shaping our behavior and choices.<br />Why?&nbsp; <br />Because of a weird (yet understandable) notion of conformity, we want to belong. and even though the people around us judge us, even though we are lied to and abused by our supposed guardians and regularly extorted for a small slice of what is rightfully ours (The planet BTW. :))&nbsp; on the whole we still maintain. <br />Carrying on with society and thus this thinly veiled illusion of &quot;freedom&quot; is maintained.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />B/F

Work 40 years in hopes of a retirement that most likely will not be there for your comfort in the near future? Most people are miserable living this way but since it is a widely recognized as a &quot;norm&quot; in our society most are not willing to alter their thought process and change their lives in nontraditional ways for the better.

				I believe what controls the masses is our inert individualistic survival mindset. This programming of our brain makes us crave food, shelter, goods, women, drugs, you name it. Think about it. Any act you commit is, in essence, completely due to the fact that you want to satisfy some desire, some craving, that you need. You go get food to fill your belly. You work out to make yourself feel better. You volunteer to give yourself that so called &quot;peace of mind&quot;. You work so you can have money. <br /><br />I implore you to think of a realistic scenario where you are acting entirely for someone else&#039;s interest. Even taking a bullet for a loved one is for your immortality in the eyes of another, which is really what we all strive for.

				I also need to come back to this thread when im not fried.<br />For usually when i read about stuff like this when im fried, i don&#039;t remember specific things but other than the fear i felt !<br />Ultimately it seems the masses control themselves, but the masses are born into or choose to live through such mass produced filters of consciousness, that are set up by za bilderbergs, zionists, rothchilds.<br />The point being the masses truly hold the power in their hands, either to continue being slaves in a larger system, or to be free themselves, among eachother.<br /><br />

				The easy answer is - those with money and their relationship with those who govern. <br /><br />In the future power will shift slowly towards those who own land, those who control the distribution and sale of what remains of the world&#039;s natural resources and those who produce and sell food.<br /><br />

Pine is trying to put WoT on a diet, but I will point out two observable facts that contradict this view.<br /><br />1. It is usually the case that the poorest countries also have the most abundant resources. This is called the resource curse in economics. The idea is that there is no positive correlation at all between natural resources and overall wealth, with oil being an extreme outlier, but it is not representative at all. Look at Japan. It has no natural resources whatsoever, but it&#039;s the world&#039;s 3rd largest economy, and was the world&#039;s 2nd largest economy for decades until very recently. Conversely, with the exception of South Africa, the whole of Africa is abundantly stacked with resources of all kinds, but it&#039;s the poorest place on earth. Similarly Russia has vast mineral wealth, but exploitation of that wealth has not made it into a rich country. Hong Kong, Singapore, Ireland, Luxembourg, these places are some of the wealthiest on earth, yet they have almost no access to natural resources to speak of! Almost every natural resource is imported to such places.<br /><br />Wealth and power then, don&#039;t have much to do with geography directly. You can tell me that Africa/Russia et al have been manipulated by external interests, but this is beside the point, even if we accept such an idea it still doesn&#039;t explain why those external interests were so much more powerful than the ones right on top of the resources, who had &#039;first dibs&#039; as it were.<br /><br />2. Power and wealth, over the last 300 years, has not drifted to those with the most productive land. That was the case certainly, a long time ago. Once the Landlords were the most powerful people there were. But...&nbsp; The entire paradigm of Capitalism itself has shifted power away from the Landlords to the Factory owners, to those who hold ownership of things far more abstract than physical land. In fact history shows that the Landlords nearly all went completely bankrupt as a result.<br /><br />In order for your prediction to come true, you need reasons why that shift would reverse. While food is obviously an important sector of the economy, the power and wealth of that sector is negligible. Farming represents a tiny tiny part of the overall economy. It used to be close to 100% &gt;200-300 years ago, now it is so tiny you&#039;ll be hard pressed to locate it in a pie chart of the economy. It&#039;s not that obtaining food to eat is unimportant. It&#039;s just that every other sector of the economy has grown much faster. The only way for the Landlords to get back into power is through massive monopolization. But given we live in an age of container ships and cargo planes, anybody trying to corner the market on food is going to go utterly bust (or literally busted by angry mobs). See, let&#039;s imagine that water becomes a lot more scarce and this generates the world you envisage where control over food production becomes hugely more important. What happens then is that there is enormous pressure on developing effective desalination equipment. In fact there is so much current research into desalination and the cost of doing it is dropping so fast it is really a non-issue. I know some people think differently, but countries like the UAE, Singapore and Australia have already put a ton of pressure on scientists to obtain decent ways of extracting fresh water from seawater, to the extent I think they&#039;ll eventually be able to do it for almost nothing.<br /><br />In fact the only ways I see that coming true, is if there is a sudden shift, not a slow one, where the world becomes a whole lot more dystopian for some reason e.g. like the Fallout videogames! Either that or world governments seriously cock it up. That seems feasible! (nearly all famines in the 20th century were man made ones, not natural Malthusian ones e.g. where governments prevented food moving, or people from moving around).<br /><br />tldr; it doesn&#039;t seem likely, but it&#039;s easy to collect bottlecaps just in case :)<br />

People naturally have their place, it&#039;s just a shit fact of life and it occurs in every community, society or whatever. Look at SR for example, you can separate the ones that push to the front (the vendors and DPR who created SR) then lower down you have the enterprising people that buy from SR to resell and then you have those that buy for percy. Ultimately the bottom two are the vendors cash-cow and then in turn the vendors are DPR&#039;s cash-cow. So even within something like SR there is always a pecking order which is just the same as life and an inherent and needed part of human society. This is why I am not particularly &quot;Revolutionary&quot; with my politics because no matter what system or society we live in there are always the Gods and the Clods however much they may want to convince you otherwise. I don&#039;t really feel the need to change the system because it benefits me how it is. Drugs are illegal = drug dealers taking a slice of the action. We pay taxes to the government = I get paid to help avoid those taxes. I mean why would I wana change something that feeds me? Then when I retire from all this and can go fully legit I&#039;ll have enough spends to make sure I can carve myself out a comfortable niche and put my kids ahead and give them the shit I didn&#039;t have. Easy. <br /><br />Oh and I&#039;m not angry dude, in fact quite the reverse. :)

				I think all this media things or governments measures does not control much. Prohibition has opposite effect, stimulation just absorbed. <br /><br />if taken country wise, time frame like 15 years is nothing, lets take 50 years. Most important factor is COST of FOOD. in any country with costly food no population growth. In any country with heavily subsidized food or free food for poor, population is growing. COST of FOOD is single and most important indicator. that phenomenon was discovered by J Forrester father is System Dynamics in 80s.<br />

				I&#039;d like to believe that the masses control themselves, just lack the desire and determination to fight for our beliefs. We are all made docile by the lies the media feeds us. Change will not come peacefully. Those with the power are not going to freely just give it away. <br /><br />But the biggest problems lie within man himself, not the government. <br /><br />

				As a man who has had some insight into the nature of existence I give you this. Life is suffering for one who has not figured it all out (become enlightened). If you break the law, who comes to arrest you and drag you away? Not Mr Bilderberg or whoever you are talking about, just sleepwalking men going through the motions. Drugs are fun as far as mundane life goes, but it is just intoxicant. Meditate- look at your own existence. What are you behind your age, date of birth, nationality, favourite band and all this. It is all illusory, and the business of some big dogs controlling your life is simply a mind game.<br /><br />I come on this website for medicine for physical ailments. Once I would have fought to the death for the greatness of LSD, but once is is seen through for what it is, that is it, you cannot buy back into it. It is not a democratic debate, the more you see first hand existence, with less and less smoke and mirrors, you become a man made of gold, whether in a palace or a beggar.<br /><br />P

				You are describing you ideal situation for living your life, and if its working for you, thats great.<br />For me, the general idea is that our western society is a democracy.&nbsp; But its not.&nbsp; If you read the original greek translation of the word, we are FAR from it.&nbsp; My point is this:-<br />We are infact living in a capitalist society, where us mere working class are told we should live in that house, under those conditions and pay those outrageous taxes, while the rich few have their money paid into off shore accounts so that they can legally avoid paying taxes.<br />Groups out there such as the masons learn knowledge that we are not priveleged to.<br />And why does all this go on?, because its by design.<br />We are a species of explorers, always searching for something, be it using drugs or looking for answers.<br />The fact is we were not meant to be enslaved, which is why there is that niggling feeling in the back of your mind that we are all under someone elses influence.<br />The question remains once more, who, or what.

				In my opinion, culture controls the masses. <br /><br />But that leads to, what shapes, and molds culture? Which one also must be reminded, that, especially in these times, culture changes at a faster rate, and can spread across vaster regions. <br /><br />This is why (I believe) a lot of the corruption now is behind media outlets, religion, government. By controlling these things, you have a hand in what people know, and can limit certain aspects of their cognitive expansions.<br /><br /><br />

				No one person or group. Humans are social animals that live in groups or packs and are driven by the need to fit into their group or pack, this happens on the big and micro level. Even those people who say &#039;i&#039;m not a conformist&#039; form their own little cliques with other non conformists. The random nature of group dynamics creates trends which are picked up by innate need to follow the herd. Sure there are stronger animals at the front who lead and have more influence on the group but no one individual or group can radically control or change the direction without the assistance of chance through natural/geological/world/environmental changes.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are groups like the Bilderburgs etc out there and they have agendas but they aren&#039;t as powerful as the tinfoil hat brigade make out.

				If it was the war on drugs, police state, elitist controlled (though won&#039;t there always be some sort of elite running any society as its sort of what the word means!) state we see in a lot of the west today then in some ways it would be a shit thing.

He cured his own skin cancer with the oil and has been spreading the word ever since... Phoenixtears.ca<br /><br />--[We can legally only do cannabis research on animals and in culture.. but the results are still amazing.. and they carry over for humans as Rick has shown]--<br /><br />Tell this to someone. That they could have saved a life of a loved one if it were not for the UN and these evil beings that have outlawed cannabis, a plant, and labelled it as a drug.. <br /><br /><br />This is proof right here that the UN and our governments are not looking out for our best interests (if that wasn&#039;t already obvious...)<br /><br /><br />Anyways... this is how I see us moving forward ... realizing that this plant IS beneficial and needed for us to evolve.<br /><br />It is what we have all been waiting for isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />- Cancer cure.. as well as a cure and treatment for 100&#039;s of other illnesses&nbsp; <br />- An amazing energy crop that can stop our petroleum use and halt the destruction of the rain forest<br />- Amazing building material that can basically end our need of concrete/cement as hempcrete can replace it.<br />- Replacement for cotton.. which uses SOOO much fresh water and pesticides.. hemp does not require herbicides/pesticides.<br />- Perfect food.. you can even blend hemp seeds with water to make milk...same color and all...<br />- The cellulose within the cannabis stalk can be made into biodegradable plastics...<br /><br />This would allow for the cost of living to drop dramatically... <br /><br /><br />I know a lot of you are not ready to unplug from the system.. it gives you a false sense of comfort I suppose?&nbsp; The truth is, things could be so much better.&nbsp; And they are for those that have found solutions.<br /><br />When humanity has had enough of this bullshit we will turn to the cannabis plant for solutions... <br /><br />I don&#039;t see any other feasible answers that can be done tomorrow besides embracing cannabis and allowing it to increase the standard of living for humans world wide.<br /><br /><br />

				Those things are never going to happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no pointing even hoping for it.<br />Since the dawn of time man has been of the capitalist mindset, so far as only those &quot;in the know&quot;, those with money and power, can have access to things the average human cannot, and never will.<br />As long as the western world sleeps peacefully at night, knowing what kind of disease and poverty exists in the third world, we will never progress with that kind of self sustaining humanity.<br />I still think to myself today, how most of america can sleep at night knowing what Katrina did to New Orleans and just left it as a wreck.&nbsp; Even Top Gear proved that on their famous trip to america.<br />As for places like Las Vegas where humans can wallow in any number of self destructive activities, dont get me started.<br />Dont get me wrong, im not some new-age hippie or anything, but there are things that i think are just stopping us from evolving altogether, as a collective race i mean, not as an individual.

				I like to think that perhaps people will wake up to reality ... but I guess its true, that it probably will never happen... some major event will have to take place to shock people into thinking.. or who knows...<br /><br />But there is always hope.. and if you spread it to one or two people and they do the same, you can change collective consciousness and awareness...<br /><br />I think cannabis would be the easiest way, although it has had a lot of propaganda and jokes spun around it..<br /><br />The fact that Tommy Chong, a celebrity known by millions, can say publicly that he cured his cancer with the essential oils of cannabis, and no one really notices... kinda speaks for itself..<br /><br />So much outside influence; entertainment, fluoride, processed food, ignorance and what have you... its a true shame that we can&#039;t collectively take a break from it all and spend a week as a species and think about how to fix it all, looking within...<br /><br />

				Well, I havent read this entire thread, so excuse me if im putting out parrallel ideas.<br /><br />Please read through this whole post before ripping my rediculous ideas apart, lol. <br /><br />IMO what it really comes down to, is does free will really exist in the way most people typically think it does, and as a result whether human conciousness really indicates some kind of higher infinite self. <br /><br />When I think about whether free will is a real thing, or an illusion of our complex minds, I think........does our self-awareness/human-conciousness really &quot;seperate&quot; us from all the other species we know of. I know this sounds like reading WAY to deeply into the matter, but if you think about it its really not. If you observe any other forms of life, such as birds, ants, bees etc etc. Most people would agree that they are carrying out the tasks that the mysterious force we call &quot;nature&quot; has in essence programmed them to do, or that their genetic line has progressed to do. But either way, an ant or a bee doesnt decide to take off and go on an adventure around the world to see exciting new places and meet new ants.....they all just do the same fucking thing, and either along the way they coincidentally participate in, or are being driven by nature with some form of purpose, to move the &quot;machine&quot; of existence along (Cross polination, birds spreading seeds etc etc etc). <br /><br />Now, why I think this relates to this argument, is in relativity. If you look at ants or bees as we did above, and then compare that relatively to their level of &quot;technology&quot; (IMO, an anthill, beehive, birds nest etc etc etc are primitive examples of technology that exist in nature), their level of our observed concious complexity, the complexity of their &quot;lives&quot; etc etc etc etc We can see that its all very simple, straight forward, across the board, but thats only RELATIVE to the complexity of the human race. I personally look at language, thoughts, society, culture, way of life, patterns in human behaviour, as merely a HIGHLY progressed/evolved version of the lives of ants, bees, birds etc etc. Now if thats truely the case across the board, and our ability to &quot;choose&quot;, have complex thoughts, create complex creations using the elements within existance, then the masses are not being controlled by anyone/thing other than nature itself on an extremely complex level. Nature/Existence, and Im not refferring to some spiritual idea, Im talking about the machine of existance we are experiencing, whatever it is, is unfolding thoughts, ideas, philosophies and in turn actions, events and technology through the minds/bodies of the humans.<br /><br />In essence what im saying is that if free will doesnt exist in the way we think it does (that our thoughts are the result of some kind of &quot;ME&quot;), and instead were merely a highly complex/evolved version of every other type of organism, then something like the monetary system, debt, culture, the police, drug use is not the product of humanity and humans free will, it is merely a highly complex result of the force of nature exerting itself through the things it has produced in existance.<br /><br />Is this what I believe? Im not sure, its possible we really are like ants and bees, only way more complex, which gives this illusion we somehow have a self/me which results in the illusion that other individuals are somehow responsible for controlling the masses. Now if you believe that there is free will, and you are seperate in some way from the machine of nature when it comes to thoughts/perceptions/ideas, then its anyones guess. Heard a million different conspiracies, jesuits, shapeshifting lizard, zionistz, NWO, the banksters etc etc etc etc. Again, all comes down to whether our species has this different element of free will to it. Beause if free will is an illusion of the complexity of the human mind, then none of those arguments are valid because none of those people were individually, seperately responsible for those thoughts and subsequent actions that lead to where we are today. They were merely another expression of nature on an awe-inspiring complex level.

I know this sounds like reading WAY to deeply into the matter, but if you think about it its really not. If you observe any other forms of life, such as birds, ants, bees etc etc. Most people would agree that they are carrying out the tasks that the mysterious force we call &quot;nature&quot; has in essence programmed them to do, or that their genetic line has progressed to do. But either way, an ant or a bee doesnt decide to take off and go on an adventure around the world to see exciting new places and meet new ants.....they all just do the same fucking thing, and either along the way they coincidentally participate in, or are being driven by nature with some form of purpose, to move the &quot;machine&quot; of existence along (Cross polination, birds spreading seeds etc etc etc). <br /><br />Now, why I think this relates to this argument, is in relativity. If you look at ants or bees as we did above, and then compare that relatively to their level of &quot;technology&quot; (IMO, an anthill, beehive, birds nest etc etc etc are primitive examples of technology that exist in nature), their level of our observed concious complexity, the complexity of their &quot;lives&quot; etc etc etc etc We can see that its all very simple, straight forward, across the board, but thats only RELATIVE to the complexity of the human race. I personally look at language, thoughts, society, culture, way of life, patterns in human behaviour, as merely a HIGHLY progressed/evolved version of the lives of ants, bees, birds etc etc. Now if thats truely the case across the board, and our ability to &quot;choose&quot;, have complex thoughts, create complex creations using the elements within existance, then the masses are not being controlled by anyone/thing other than nature itself on an extremely complex level. Nature/Existence, and Im not refferring to some spiritual idea, Im talking about the machine of existance we are experiencing, whatever it is, is unfolding thoughts, ideas, philosophies and in turn actions, events and technology through the minds/bodies of the humans.<br /><br />In essence what im saying is that if free will doesnt exist in the way we think it does (that our thoughts are the result of some kind of &quot;ME&quot;), and instead were merely a highly complex/evolved version of every other type of organism, then something like the monetary system, debt, culture, the police, drug use is not the product of humanity and humans free will, it is merely a highly complex result of the force of nature exerting itself through the things it has produced in existance.<br /><br />Is this what I believe? Im not sure, its possible we really are like ants and bees, only way more complex, which gives this illusion we somehow have a self/me which results in the illusion that other individuals are somehow responsible for controlling the masses. Now if you believe that there is free will, and you are seperate in some way from the machine of nature when it comes to thoughts/perceptions/ideas, then its anyones guess. Heard a million different conspiracies, jesuits, shapeshifting lizard, zionistz, NWO, the banksters etc etc etc etc. Again, all comes down to whether our species has this different element of free will to it. Beause if free will is an illusion of the complexity of the human mind, then none of those arguments are valid because none of those people were individually, seperately responsible for those thoughts and subsequent actions that lead to where we are today. They were merely another expression of nature on an awe-inspiring complex level.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>From an existential viewpoint, your point makes sense.

If you are really looking for the answer to this question, then decades of research would not yield the answer. Historians spend their entire lives dedicated to very few events in history; learning languages; investigating real and forged documents; studying contradictory theses and impetus. This kind of topic is fun to kick around--as it has already reached 10 pages--but it has no end, like the question about religion or life. That is not to say that it should not be considered. If you peruse the thread, then you will most certainly find insight into the question--and more importantly, into ourselves--like pkizenko89 has offered regarding fear.<br /><br />My two cents... psychology (neurophysiology), sociology, economics, physiochemistry of gravity, environmental pollutants, and extraterrestrial radiation, to name a few. I hope this gives better insight into how complex the answer will be in full.

				Man! Everyone has made some great points and I don&#039;t have anything to add that would be a better explanation since I agree with most of them in a one way or another. It&#039;s nice to know there are intelligent people on a forum for discussing drug purchases. Most of the world is quick to blanket us with the label of junkie or druggie which has negative connotations tied to it.

				I didn&#039;t read this whole thread so if it has already been said then i apologize.<br /><br />Desires.<br /><br />The wants and needs of every human is what makes the world go &#039;round.<br />The attitude of &quot;I want that!&quot; or &quot;I do not want that!&quot; is what keeps what people call society going. <br />Someone who doesn&#039;t want anything does not steal or kill or use drugs or do anything else. Everything people do<br />is because they want something out of it. <br /><br />And what people call &quot;necessities&quot; are basically just obvious &#039;wants&#039;. All necessities are wanted but not all &#039;wants&#039; are &#039;necessities&#039;. <br /><br />I believe that if every want/need of every human would be fulfilled instantly upon that desire then interaction with anyone else would not be necessary, we evolved to become social creatures because it helped us personally in the long run.
