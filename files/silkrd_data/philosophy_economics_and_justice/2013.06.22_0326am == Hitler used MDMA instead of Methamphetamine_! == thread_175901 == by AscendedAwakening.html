				I was vapin on some sap and got to thinking what if Hitler had been given MDMA by his physician instead of Meth, granted they didn&#039;t know that the compound was active and despite discovering the compound germany lost it as a spoilage of war to the allies.. But what do you think hitler could of Accomplished on MDMA? I think he would of given the jews Israel on his own and ban cigarettes but supply e-cigs and snus to the entire population. He probably would have had concentration camps that mass produced hella weed concentrate products and troll the fuck outta the 1937 marihuana tax act of the U.S. Also if the U.S. did try to attack MDMA influenced hitler they would have a much easier time since the Allies would be all focus and in the zone while Hitler is droppin the base getting gloved meltin his face off. ;D

				MDMA isnt just a happy-go-lucky drug, things can and do go wrong while on MDMA, WWII would have still happened Hitler was a prisoner to the natural &#039;drugs&#039; in his brain (just as we all are) <br /><br />If anythiung could have saved the day i think adolf should have dropped acid instead:)

				You ever seen someone in a rage while rolling on MDMA?&nbsp; It&#039;s not pretty.&nbsp; I knew some niggas that would often get in shootouts in the streets and alleys ducking behind random parked cars and shit in a not so good area while rolling.&nbsp; Street niggas can get pretty crazy on MDMA.&nbsp; Hitler though?&nbsp; Maybe if he had LSD he would have made all that art that he so desired.&nbsp; Who knows? :P

				I&#039;d imagine someone in the street thug/gangster lifestyle, or any type of person with an inclination towards violence and doing whatever the fuck they want, might have the self confidence to do some pretty crazy shit while on MDMA.

				Maybe Hitler used concepts like the rest of us?<br /><br />We are beings of volitional consciousness with open conceptualization.<br /><br />Who cares what he used?<br /><br />All I know is he was a fool, he had gold... to use it gold has to circulate.

				I just came across this thread.&nbsp; Damn that is some crazy shit.&nbsp; Check this out, my mothers mother (my grandmother) had to sneak over to the US otherwise she would have been killed, my mother never would have been born, etc... However, I am Catholic.<br /><br />If Hitler took Meth, he was a fool....If he had taken MDMA, but not everyyday the world could have been better.&nbsp; Even back then it was all about drugs.&nbsp; Im sure that when Hitler didnt get his drugs, he went haywire, wanted to kill everyone, its called withdrawl.&nbsp; When you arent happy and want to die from not feeling good, you just want the feeling to end, some however, take the feeling and want their feeling and people around them to feel the same way....<br /><br />Why cant it be the 70s?&nbsp; I was born in the 80s, Wow has the world changed to just complete shit.

				Nazis used lots of meth:<br /><br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/nazis-meth-world-war-ii_n_3384881.html<br /><br />In an attempt to fuel its youthful but increasingly exhausted fighting force during World War II, the Nazis reportedly turned to addictive and potentially dangerous substances, including a form of what is known today as the illegal drug methamphetamine, currently a rising problem in Europe.<br /><br />This narcotic-fueled side of the Nazi war effort is illuminated in letters sent home by Nazi soldiers such as Heinrich Boll, a famous German author awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1972.<br /><br />While a soldier in his 20s, Boll wrote to his parents to beg for refills of a drug called Pervitin, an &quot;alertness aid&quot; that was actually an early form of crystal meth, according to German news outlet Der Spiegel. The drug was popularized in the 1930s by Berlin-based company Temmler Werke, and a Nazi officer then passed the compound -- and its &quot;miracle pill&quot; reputation -- along to the German front, which was soon flooded with millions of Pervitin tablets.<br /><br />The truth about the substance, however, is much less miraculous.<br /><br />Modern meth users initially experience an intensely pleasurable high and an energy surge, but this high becomes harder and harder to achieve over time. Meanwhile, the drug wreaks havoc on abusers&#039; psyche and brain functions, leading to anxiety, confusion, insomnia, mood disturbances, violent behavior, paranoia, visual and auditory hallucinations and delusions.<br /><br />A 2005 report by Der Spiegel suggests that even as German leaders were pumping their foot soldiers full of the drug, some German doctors had reservations about it. The Reich&#039;s minister of health, Leonardo Conti, reportedly attempted to curtail Previtin use, but had only limited success.<br /><br />These regulatory efforts could not have been helped much by the fact that Adolf Hitler himself was given daily injections of methamphetamine by his doctor from 1942 until his death in 1945, according to the BBC.<br /><br />Meanwhile, meth was not the only addictive substance used by Nazi troops to perform everyday duties. Alcohol abuse was also prevalent and even encouraged among the German military during the same time period, per Der Spiegel.<br /><br />Today, the popularity of crystal meth use is growing in Germany, and the drug&#039;s prevalence increased significantly in 2012, reports The Local. Dr. Roland Härtel­-Petri, an expert in addiction, psychiatry and psychotherapy, suggested it is easier for meth addicts to escape notice in Germany than it is in the U.S., where anti-drug campaigns use gripping images to publicize the horrifying damage addiction can do to the user&#039;s teeth and body.<br /><br />The drug has also become an issue across the border in the Czech Republic, where it is cooked in small kitchen labs and has proved popular among partiers, according to the Prague Post. The two neighboring countries have vowed to crack down on the fast-spreading stimulant, according to The Local.<br /><br />MY FAVORITE DRUG FACT EVER&gt; <br /><br />D-IX<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br /><br />D-IX was a cocaine-based experimental drug cocktail developed by the Nazis in 1944 for military application. Nazi doctors found that equipment-laden test subjects who had taken the drug could march 55 miles (88.5 kilometers) without resting before they collapsed. Each tablet contained 5 mg of oxycodone (brand name Eukodal), 5 mg of cocaine and 3 mg of methamphetamine (then called Pervitin, now available under the brandname Desoxyn. The researcher who uncovered the project, Wolf Kemper, said: &quot;The aim was to use D-IX to redefine the limits of human endurance.&quot; Nazi doctors were enthusiastic about the results, and planned to supply all German troops with the pills, but the war ended before D-IX could be put into mass production, though it did see limited use among a handful of Neger and Biber pilots.
