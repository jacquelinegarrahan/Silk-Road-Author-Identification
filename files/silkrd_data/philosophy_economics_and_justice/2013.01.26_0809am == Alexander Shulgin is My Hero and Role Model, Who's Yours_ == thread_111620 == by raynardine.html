				i have many heroes, but one that stands out in particular is terence mckenna. he has influenced me greatly, in many ways. a brilliant mind that was taken from us far too soon. i admire his unwavering passion for psychedelics and his ability to stand up for his beliefs, despite lots of people thinking he&#039;s crazy... i can relate. ;)

				Ron Paul is my hero because he stands up in the face of globalist scum and as a public figure actually exemplifies the concept that consistency of action and moral integrity are inseparable notions, and that the latter is meaningless without the former. Also because I think he understands whats best in a political sense better than anyone else in any seat of power.

				Miyamoto Musashi, samurai active late 16th, early 17th century. He wrote a book on martial arts that should be on any martial artists must-read list. It is also quite interesting from a daoist/zen perspective.

				Nikola Tesla. Possibly the greatest inventor to ever live, whose inventions eventually came to be manipulated by the US government in order to create basically the modern world we have today. Imagine if we had actually gone through with his Free-energy towers, where we would be today as a society, let alone the rest of his life-altering inventions.<br /><br />Timothy Leary/Terrence McKenna. Both were psychonauts of the highest order in the process of exploring the human experience and more through psychotropic compounds, as well as new-age shamans and intellectuals.<br /><br />And finally, Michael Jordan. In my opinion the greatest competitor to ever live, and a man who always took what he wanted and waited for nothing to fall in his lap. Goes to show you that practice really can bring you near perfection.

				In a nutshell my hero&#039;s are all of the chemists and scientists in the past that made it possible for us to have as many wonderful compounds and the ones today that still works with them. All of them.
