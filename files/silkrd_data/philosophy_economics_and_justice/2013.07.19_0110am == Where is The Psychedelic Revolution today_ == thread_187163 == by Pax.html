				So the Psychedelic revolution had its crest in the 60s with the Beatles,LSD and woodstock. It came in the form of Psychedelic rock and pop,communes and anti-vietnam protests. It then fell to the recession lows of the Nixion and Regan years. Then in the 90s it went into an upswing (although not as high as the crest). It came on with the invention of the internet, Bob Marley,,as always psychedelics, anti-apparratide. So where is the revloution at today(recession,upswing or stand still), what form is it coming on in?

				Stigma against psychedelics is still pretty strong these days. Getting a decent number of people to do them would require a pretty wide change of opinion. Until then, they&#039;ll remain niche drugs, and won&#039;t have much of an impact on society at all.<br /><br />Price is also an issue. In the 60s, LSD was supposedly &quot;cheap enough to hand out freely&quot;, but I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware that the price is a little higher these days. High prices will of course keep the drugs more restrictive. The one important psychedelic (or category of them) these days that is potentially cheap enough to be handed out is the NBOMe series, and if anything is going to popularize psychedelics in the near future, it will be NBOMe. Production is extremely plentiful, although it already deals with some bad stigma of its own.

				I think with SR providing access easy to psychedelics we&#039;re in an upswing phase again. I doubt it&#039;ll get as big as in the 60&#039;s, but you never know ;)

				Most definite upswing. The numbers of people who have access to psychedelics (Silk Road and the like) as well as the percentage of global population that are shifting attitudes and experimenting is growing. It&#039;s a movement that is going to resurge, I believe, in the next couple years and hopefully boom in the next decade.

The counter culture was an ideology and way of life that challenged the prevailing social order through free expression, free love and non-materialism. Psychedelia was about death of the ego. Unfortunately, the ego is now the primary driver of most people&#039;s lives. Facebook, Twitter and our rampant materialist consumerism all while destroying our planet at an accelerating rate is the antithesis of the psychedelic revolution.

				In academia. The genration of the 60&#039;s either grew out of it or grew into it and are researching as a profession. It exists in medical research specifically. I read that uni of Florida and Imperial college London both have published research finnding that magic mushrooms helps overcome traumatic experiences (PTSD), this is a huge discovery. Sure it might have been known by many who have taken the drug in the past but it opens up new avenues to patients that haven&#039;t. We are succeeding in destigmatising psychedelics. IMO we are taking the right approach now, whereas in the past we weren&#039;t.

				Agreed.&nbsp; I think the revolution is happening now in scientific research, and probably in pockets of countries around the world, but unfortunately I would call it a tempered upswing overall.<br /><br />Keep in mind that one&#039;s point of view is largely shaped by the region and country they inhabit.&nbsp; There is a lot of stuff going on all over the world that you can&#039;t possibly know about ;)

				Hi all, it&#039;s the afternoon and I&#039;m bored so I am going to pontificate....<br /><br />PAX, I think your psych history is a bit off (no personal criticism intended, believe me!), that&#039;s kind of the condensed accepted version of events. Bob Marley certainly had zilch to do with it, as psychedlia really incompatible with Rastafarianism, and Woodstock, while a significant event, was just a lot of people standing in a field (a nod to Pulp there) listening to some decent music and getting their kit off. (No shame there, then, a lovely thing to do). The only performer at Woodstock who remains utterly relevant was Neil Young, who refused to be filmed with CSNY because he sensed it&#039;s self-importance was B.S.<br /><br />In the 70&#039;s psychedlia moved into some really unexpected places - Acid played a major part in the start of disco, of all things, as it was practically the house drug at The Loft in NY, the birth place of it all. And from personal experience I can vouch for the fact that acid and shrooms were very popular amongst a lot of punks, and the post-punk movement. From The Fall&#039;s first LP (1978) - &quot;I don&#039;t need the acid factory/ I&#039;ve got mushrooms in the fields&quot;.<br /><br />Operation Julie changed a lot of things. For those that don&#039;t know, look it up. The largest drug bust in the world at the time (1977), the chemists in Wales and North London were responsible for mind-boggling quantities of Acid circulating around the world. Over the next few years the stockpiles ran out.<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak with any authority on the US, but in the UK the fragments of hippies/squatters/post-punks became what was eventually the traveler/crustie movement, with the Stonehenge Free Festivals and overlap into the middle period of Glastonbury, where in the 80&#039;s psych drugs were openly for sale and consumed by with gusto by all.<br /><br />Then a curious thing happened in the late 80&#039;s, as the rave movement started and hooked up with the traveler community. Acid house, which had it&#039;s origins in Detroit techno AND in the Chicago house that was derived directly from the disco and DJing originating in the acid-soaked Loft, coincided with MDMA sweeping into the scene. You can be purist about it if you like, but it really was a second wind of psychedelia. Everybody just got off their nuts and danced.<br /><br />To cut a long story short, laws, busts, economic factors, shifts in political discourse and the inevitable burn-out ended that scene, but there was, in my opinion, a subtle afterword. Techno was computer music, and some of the people on that rave scene were some of the pioneers of the internet, and came with the libertarian background of psychedlia and partying. The ground work for an anarchic, libertarian approach to the internet, and to drugs, came from these people.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say where the Psychedelic Revolution is today, because I don&#039;t know, and because I think it is an out-dated concept when everything from Hollywood films to print dresses in GAP reflect the visual tropes of psychedlia.<br /><br />But I can suggest that I know where the bastard love-child of those psychedelic phases is to be found. You are on it, reading this.<br /><br />Take care.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				So is the Revolution &quot;The Summer of Love&quot; or &quot;The Death of Hippie?&quot;<br /><br />I voted &quot;Other&quot; meaning &quot;Completely Unnecessary.&quot;<br /><br />What did you want from it?<br /><br />The last time I checked, Keith and the Stones are still out there, but we have Snoop Dogg acting the douche by saying he&#039;s Bob Marley re-incarnated when he was already born before Bob even died..... WTF!?!<br /><br />Am I going to say that Snoop is unaware?&nbsp; Not at all. Snoop is definitely turned on.&nbsp; I agree with his choice to go Jamaican. I just think to associate himself with a reincarnated spirit without at least a FEW tunes out before going all Shirley McClaine, I think Bob would probably have appreciated it.<br /><br />I think one Miles Davis is more valuable than The Grateful Dead and all of their hippie fans-- which is sad-- because I mean no disrespect to those guys, but the amount of value placed on tripping and dancing is excessive.&nbsp; <br /><br />Please don&#039;t misunderstand me- this is not a value judgement against the Dead, Deadheads, or hippies. It is just that any kind of statement about revolution comes completely loaded with other peoples&#039; assumptions.<br /><br />My point about Miles is this: everyone pro-The Psychedelic Revolution is probably pretty positive on the culture of the Dead, Marley, Captain Beefheart, Zappa, Television, Sonic Youth, etc.-- those performers are well-liked and literally worshiped in some cases.&nbsp; To give any criticism at all is to antagonize the supposedly peaceable Hippies.<br /><br />But Miles Davis was NEVER well-liked by the public.&nbsp; Miles was absolutely loved, but due to his intellect, he was extremely difficult to deal with if you were a fool or a sucker.&nbsp; Miles had no time for any fucking hippies.<br /><br />While those close to the Dead work in math and the sciences-- I&#039;m thinking Barlowe, and there is the Silicon Valley crowd, the Dead were a folk rock group that played folk music that was a bit evolved.&nbsp; While there was magic, they didn&#039;t create about six distinct forms of music... <br /><br />But if there is one lesson to take away from this &quot;Psychedelic&nbsp; Revolution&quot; it is that we should view people and the government as modular, component parts similar to a computer program.&nbsp; The party the candidate belongs to shouldn&#039;t matter at all.&nbsp; The rules that encompass our governmental offices should be so precise that the candidates&#039; race, religion, culture, etc. don&#039;t matter and demographics become far less important.<br /><br />A black Muslim female of any age should be able to go to the shopping mall on public transport and publicly be able to eat an ice cream and return home without incident.&nbsp; In this country, due to the efforts of people like the notoriously non-psychedelic Rosa Parks-- generally, in the USA, a young Muslim girl alone can do this. <br /><br />Even when Egypt was peaceful (and happy!?!)&nbsp; that would have been impossible.&nbsp; And it is true for every other major Islamic country.<br /><br />Until basic civil rights for the individual such as women&#039;s rights and protection from indentured servitude (slavery, specifically in South Asia and Africa), you can trip all you like, but humanity will not be able to leave Earth and migrate to the stars.<br /><br />All of the big ideas you can get tripping have ALL been had-- repeatedly-- since before recorded history.<br /><br />It took the creation of math and language to create notepad to create the interwebs to create the BTC.&nbsp; It took work to bring the pipe dreams of junkies into reality.<br /><br />This life experience is said to be many things, but if you happened to see the Matrix, you might have noticed something:<br /><br />Most of human recorded experience has been about how to avoid being enslaved in the first place, how to stop being enslaved if you find yourself enslaved, and then to make an ethical decision as to whether all sentient beings should be free from slavery, and what we should all do about it.<br /><br />Now we have to worry about technological slavery. Recently in the BBC, an article was posted stating researchers at DARPA had succeeded in wiping memory with electricity.<br /><br />Why would any U.S. agency be working with that?<br /><br />If the psychedelic revolution teaches us anything here at SR, it is to keep to your personal security and that there is NO FRIEND ANYWHERE.<br /><br />Trippy music and cool, swirly graphics just don&#039;t get it done anymore.&nbsp; I&#039;m sorry, I&#039;m not impressed. <br /><br />The Freedom Riders were not carrying. They got the shit repeatedly beat out of them completely sober.<br /><br />Real political change is effected through fearless suffering for someone other than one&#039;s self, and their civil rights.<br /><br />Meanwhile, voter apathy showing at below 50% over multiple years proved damning when people who were not lazy citizens voted their local reps into place to control your kids&#039; school text books, they voted to take away your sister&#039;s and daughter&#039;s and mother&#039;s reproductive rights, they are able to place extremely backwards justices in the supply line at low local levels which become Federal Judges because those people got out of bed, organized, and voted.<br /><br />The Conservatives do not smoke weed and do not trip, they think hippies are sub-human and are going to Hell, but no matter what they think- they go out and VOTE.<br /><br />What the Hell does a fucking hippie do?<br /><br />Sleeps, forgets to vote, smokes weed and talks about the revolution, and while they pay you fuckers off with moderately legal weed in some states, they have managed to take away nearly every civil liberty your grandparents fought two wars to ensure.<br /><br />So no, you have far less freedom and civil liberties now than you did in 1986 or 1968.<br /><br />And now these same fuckers are blending spider DNA with sheep, and have done so, and publicly announced it.&nbsp; They use the milk&#039;s enzymes to make bullet proof vests.<br /><br />Humanity is at a cusp. And let me tell you, the religions are not at fault and are not to blame. The religions serve one purpose- when humanity nearly kills itself off totally and nearly takes the Earth and all life with it, the religions will not be the guys arguing &quot;I told you so&quot;, because there will be very few left and no time or meaning to it....&nbsp; It will be a Canticle for Leibowitz.....<br /><br />And yet, I am personally happy despite the knowledge that the ship is going down.<br />Just my two cents,<br />Drunken Afficianado

				&nbsp;I really did not mean for this to become this big of a debate. Just some conversation to pass the time. The 60s when the psychedelic movement came to popularity fueled by people like Aldous Huxley, Scott Fitzgerald and Ernst Hemingway from the 30s and 40s and then further on.. the 70s brought a large decline into progressive rock as well as Nixon and &quot;the war on drugs&quot;.<br />The 80&#039;s brought&nbsp; Regan Pop and synthetic&nbsp; rock, as well as heavy rock.&nbsp; and an increased war on drugs to the USA Many new wars the hippie movement was no where to be found(Maybe that&#039;s what I should have called it &quot;The Hippie Movement&quot; not the Psychedelic Movement)&nbsp; . As well as it brought the capitalistic Margaret Thatcher to the UK. BUT in the 90s with the election of the liberal Clinton and the invention of the worldwide web. The hippie movement went into an upswing. Even country stars like Alan Jackson were sporting a liberal working class hero sort of vibe.. Hippie sounding bands .. like a good friend of mine said and I quote &quot;The 90s were like the 60s standing on your head&quot; Then Bush was elected in the 2000&#039;s and started another war as well as cracked down on hippies and drugs again.. My whole question was now that we have a &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;SEMI&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; Liberal President where is the hippie revolution... Alot of the people in the USA seem to be in a sort of 70ish or early 80s vibe but Psychedelia is without a doubt on at least a slight upswing.. all I can do is speak for what I observe and my local area that is why I was asking about everyone else and there perspectives?

It is fairly certain that there was wide access to mind altering drugs two thousand years ago - eg Amanitas in Northern Europe, Ibogaine in West Africa, presumed Ergot derivatives in Southern Europe, Psilocybin in Eastern Siberia, Peyote in North America, Ayahuasca in South America, Pituri in Australia etc.<br /><br />For societies to increase their population without losing stability, perhaps there is a &#039;golden ratio&#039; between those who accept what they are told, and those who question what they are told. This would explain why governments and establish religions are opposed to the uncontrolled use of psychoactive drugs, which tempt those taking them to question the nature of their reality. In Roman times, those found using drugs from the Temple Mysteries for &#039;recreational&#039; purposes faced the death penalty. An interesting parallel is that today in the Roman Catholic tradition, only the priest is permitted to drink the Communion alcohol, the solvent thought to have been used to dissolve psychoactive herbs used in ancient ceremonies.<br /><br />But going back to that blip, it will probably be at least 200 years before it is possible to evaluate reliably the longer term consequences of Sandoz and Eli Lilly distributing LSD in the 1950s.<br />

Bob Marley certainly had zilch to do with it, as psychedlia really incompatible with Rastafarianism, and Woodstock, while a significant event, was just a lot of people standing in a field (a nod to Pulp there) listening to some decent music and getting their kit off. (No shame there, then, a lovely thing to do). The only performer at Woodstock who remains utterly relevant was Neil Young, who refused to be filmed with CSNY because he sensed it&#039;s self-importance was B.S.<br /><br />In the 70&#039;s psychedlia moved into some really unexpected places - Acid played a major part in the start of disco, of all things, as it was practically the house drug at The Loft in NY, the birth place of it all. And from personal experience I can vouch for the fact that acid and shrooms were very popular amongst a lot of punks, and the post-punk movement. From The Fall&#039;s first LP (1978) - &quot;I don&#039;t need the acid factory/ I&#039;ve got mushrooms in the fields&quot;.<br /><br />Operation Julie changed a lot of things. For those that don&#039;t know, look it up. The largest drug bust in the world at the time (1977), the chemists in Wales and North London were responsible for mind-boggling quantities of Acid circulating around the world. Over the next few years the stockpiles ran out.<br /><br />I can&#039;t speak with any authority on the US, but in the UK the fragments of hippies/squatters/post-punks became what was eventually the traveler/crustie movement, with the Stonehenge Free Festivals and overlap into the middle period of Glastonbury, where in the 80&#039;s psych drugs were openly for sale and consumed by with gusto by all.<br /><br />Then a curious thing happened in the late 80&#039;s, as the rave movement started and hooked up with the traveler community. Acid house, which had it&#039;s origins in Detroit techno AND in the Chicago house that was derived directly from the disco and DJing originating in the acid-soaked Loft, coincided with MDMA sweeping into the scene. You can be purist about it if you like, but it really was a second wind of psychedelia. Everybody just got off their nuts and danced.<br /><br />To cut a long story short, laws, busts, economic factors, shifts in political discourse and the inevitable burn-out ended that scene, but there was, in my opinion, a subtle afterword. Techno was computer music, and some of the people on that rave scene were some of the pioneers of the internet, and came with the libertarian background of psychedlia and partying. The ground work for an anarchic, libertarian approach to the internet, and to drugs, came from these people.<br /><br />I can&#039;t say where the Psychedelic Revolution is today, because I don&#039;t know, and because I think it is an out-dated concept when everything from Hollywood films to print dresses in GAP reflect the visual tropes of psychedlia.<br /><br />But I can suggest that I know where the bastard love-child of those psychedelic phases is to be found. You are on it, reading this.<br /><br />Take care.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Excellent history - very accurate. <br /><br />I think one thing you have to keep in mind is that in 1965, it would have been impossible for most people to imagine anyone freely living the kind of life that a lot of people&nbsp; around psychedelic scenes today (whether it&#039;s the European and global psytrance scenes, or the vast swathes of Northern California in which the 60s/70s never really ended) are still effectively free to live without much interference. People on both sides of the divide thought that it would have to be the end of Western civilization if you let festivals happen without sending in the police. What&#039;s emerged today is a world which nobody really expected then, and is not exactly the world anyone wanted, in which you can live a hippy life happily as long as you have the money and don&#039;t get in anyone&#039;s face...just as you can be openly gay and still get elected to public office in most European countries and much of North America (which was still impossible in the 1980s almost everywhere)... but we are still basically ruled by the corporate super-rich. But they can&#039;t tell us how to live like they once did. It&#039;s a very weird situation that I don&#039;t think hardly any of us really have a handle on yet. The psychedelic revolution was a huge part of it but it was part of an overall process in which probably the only people who got everything they wanted were the new elite&nbsp; - especially the tech giants. <br /><br />Oh but one point for the record - acid was no cheaper in the late 60s than now - it was probably more expensive in real terms...the people who gave it away gave it away at great personal cost because they believed in it as their karmic and revolutionary duty. We could certainly do with a little more of that right now!

				^ gotta agree with you there. The whole psytrance/outdoor doof movement is the best contemporary example.<br /><br />A large number of people enjoying psychedelics within a reasonably small space all with a generally similar intent. When the main stage at a doof is reaching its peak one can literally see the spiral of energy spinning above not only feeding the people but also feeding universe. Its a special gift to experience that state of being.<br /><br />It&#039;s as close to a revolution as possible given the current state of the world.<br /><br />

				Assuming that when the psychedelic revolution is complete there will be no one in jail, an objective measurement of its progress might be gained by monitoring the size of the prison population, which in England doubled between 1950 and 1980, and doubled again between 1980 and 2010.

				This is a good topic.. and to have a psychedelic revolution you really need people who can be responsible for themselves.&nbsp; As I said in another thread, too many people these days craft their persona from their environment spoon feeding them.&nbsp; It is the highest level ever with all the groupthink and social media,etc<br /><br />it would be like giving the Borg acid now.&nbsp; &nbsp;would be a total train wreck<br /><br />that is probably why things like nBOM and molly can be popular since you dont get the self discovery of a true psychedelic revolution and all the baggage and responsibility that comes with it..&nbsp; so you get the energetic trippy hippies instead of just the stoner spaced hippies<br /><br />most people aren&#039;t looking to put in a lot of effort

				&nbsp; &nbsp;What if LSD becomes incredibly cheap again, so cheap that it can be handed out?
