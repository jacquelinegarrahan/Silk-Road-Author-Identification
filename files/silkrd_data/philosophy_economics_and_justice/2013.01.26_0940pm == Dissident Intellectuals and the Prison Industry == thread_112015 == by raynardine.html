				The pure unadulterated and well-documented fact that big government has become a multi-trillion dollar industry of lobbyists, fine wine, caviar, and whatnot only adds insult to injury when you consider the other side of that glitsy light-bulb encrusted facade.<br /><br />The prison industry.<br /><br />Not only are &quot;undesirables&quot; placed in a cold dank concrete cell against their will, they are placed there at taxpayer expense, supposedly for our own good.<br /><br />&quot;Drug dealers and crazy ax murderers should not be allowed to roam free out on the streets!&quot; &quot;Think of the children!&quot;<br /><br />You know, why don&#039;t we think of the children?<br /><br />What abut Juvenile Detention Centers? Everyone knows that&#039;s &quot;Prison for Children&quot;<br /><br />Why the fuck does this even exist?<br /><br />Why won&#039;t YOU think of the children? You know why? Because you&#039;re a politician who accepts taxpayer money, and spends it on keeping children behind bars.<br /><br />The fact that not only does Juvenile Detention Centers exist, but there are a great many of them, and almost certainly private versions of this as well.<br /><br />Normally, I would not object to privatization, since I loath government in all of its forms, however, handing off contracts to corporate welfarist types by way of corporate entitlement programs like that are even MORE abhorrent to me.<br /><br />The kind of of Corporate Entitlement I speak of is often regarded with deep loathing by the name of SOPA / PIPA and the Arrogance of Motion Picture Industry.<br /><br />MPAA and RIAA are the perfect examples of Corporate Entitlement I&#039;ve ever seen, and it makes me sick in ways I did not realize I was capable of experiencing.<br /><br />Similar to this phenomenon is the concept of Statutory Rape.<br /><br />I can not personally consider the disgust I feel when cold blooded murderers get 4 years in prison, while peaceful and responsible marijuana vendors get 24 years in prison, without also considering the concept of Statutory Rape.<br /><br />You know how in some territories of the United States, two young lovers both aged 16 will be charged with &quot;raping each other&quot;?<br /><br />If not, I&#039;m sure your country has committed similar misdeeds.<br /><br />There is also the tale of woe by a 13 year old young male who has few friends, but found someone who he wanted to be with over the Internet, and talked the older individual into spending the night with him.<br /><br />The 13 year old&#039;s lesbian mother, who normally neglects him, was suddenly protective and self-righteous, and informed the police of that region that this was not her responsibility, that she did everything she was supposed to do.<br /><br />After painful and invasive examination, &quot;For Evidence,&quot; and repeated interrogation for months, eventually the young 13 year old cracked, and divulged the name of the young man he asked to join him in bed to the so-called authorities.<br /><br />They then charged the young man with statutory rape, even though it was the younger party who insisted on it!<br /><br />It was entirely consensual, and the younger party is considered by nearly all adults he knows &quot;very mature for his age.&quot;<br /><br />You call that Justice?<br /><br />You call any of this Justice?<br /><br />I have not even begin describing the kind of true sodomy practiced between the &quot;authorities&quot; and the Mexican drug cartels.<br /><br />I do not mind honest and principled business, and I am very pro-Capitalist, however, when one marries the &quot;corporation&quot; with the State and perverts principles of economics and fair business practice with this kind of hateful deceptive and fraudulent practice, it makes me long for expensive automatic firearms and gushing fountains of blood.<br /><br />

				The prison system is fucked.&nbsp; It is a scam to make lobbyists and politicians more money through the privatized prisons.<br /><br />Just as everything else in the US, it is totally corrupt.

				Mao Zedong&#039;s most important political insight was that &quot;political power grows out of the barrel of a gun&quot;.<br /><br />That the state can imprison people that have harmed no one, such as drug users and sellers, shows the incredible, violent power of the state.

				I do not believe in any &quot;Prison System.&quot;<br /><br />When socialist-bent individuals speak of corruption, they think that Capitalism and Anarchy are the true evils, and that government is a good thing somehow.<br /><br />NO.<br /><br />Most people on the Internet, and Silk Road by extension, have never read Economics in One Lesson, they barely know who Von Mises is.<br /><br />I know with a reasonable level of confidence that no one here has read the articles posted at http://mises.org/ (Mises Institute)<br /><br />It makes me sad, because true anarchist capitalism is not about all-powerful multinational corporations, it is about doing business with people in a fair market, rather than shooting people and taking their farms, lands, property, and children from them, and that sort of brigandry.<br /><br />True anarchist capitalism is perverted by the State, and turned into something that says it wants to allow people to change their circumstances and become financially successful, but taxes your left arm, right leg, and firstborn child, instead.<br /><br />Taxes should not exist.<br /><br />Prisons should not exist.<br /><br />Guns will not cease existing, so everyone should have guns, including young children and eccentric old men.<br /><br />Political power does stem from the barrel of a gun, so the only way to achieve true equality is to ensure all people have them.

				Raynardine, what do you think of Robert Nozick&#039;s thought experiment that all political systems will eventually lead towards libertarianism?<br /><br />For you what is the big difference between libertarianism and Anarchism? Do you really think people wish to have to protect themselves all the time? Protection agencies are pretty much minimalist governments IMO. Communities decide on their rules and need them enforced. People want to make their cash not worry about protecting it. It would be up to the community whether they want a prison system,execution system, exile, etc.<br /><br />Also, Raynardine I believe it was you who said you wanted SR to be a bastion of reason and harm reduction. One word replies of Pussy or calling someone a cocksucker doesn&#039;t make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside when it comes to a debate forum.
