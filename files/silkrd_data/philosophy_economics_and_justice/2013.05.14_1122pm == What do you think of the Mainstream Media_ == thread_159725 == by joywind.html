				The mainstream media seems to consist of Jewish billionaires, mincing homosexuals like Anderson Cooper who were born to astronomical inherited wealth, bizarro people with mental problems like Rachel Maddow, rich white guys who are enraged for no reason like Chris Matthews, all shrieking about &#039;&#039;racism&#039;&#039; and &quot;sexism&quot;.<br /><br />Hyperprivileged white people, sex perverts, Jewish bigots claiming that working class people are all &#039;&#039;privileged&#039;&#039; and &#039;&#039;racist&#039;&#039;, in other words.<br /><br />The total disengagement from reality on display here would be a source of fun and hilarity were it not such a disturbing and haughty example of overclass hubris.

				We are within it.&nbsp; A lot of people think a person or show may not care.&nbsp; For example the Daily Show.&nbsp; John Stewart is obviously down.&nbsp; Is he perfect; no he is not.&nbsp; Just because some people can&#039;t live off granola or aren&#039;t 911 truthers doesn&#039;t mean they are a part of some conspiracy.&nbsp; That&#039;s my two cents

				The mainstream media has evolved from a group that liked to report the events to the people, to a group that does some of that, but also shapes it with selective facts, and also gives their opinion on these facts. <br /><br />I doubt many of these people are super privileged like you say. Many become rich, because ABC pays their news anchor a lot of money.

				I think that the mainstream media should be renamed corporate media, because of the exorbitant amount of dollars private companies pour into televised news channels and newspapers, both online and in print. There are few sources around who independently diffuse information; most media groups are censored from publishing certain information that goes against the interests of the funders -- and of course receive budgets for their operations, for emphasizing certain aspects that support investors&#039; agendas, oftentimes by blatantly manipulating the truth. <br /><br />Mainstream media is also adorned by advertisements, which are directly geared towards influencing our relationship with desire, status and our bodies, in such a way that we will find fulfillment and happiness by buying this or that product. Those who live in urban areas are constantly bombarded both subliminally and grotesquely on a daily and constant basis, and a small ratio of this has advanced to small remote villages all around world, slowly integrating itself into culture -- there are more who wish to leave their homes and to come to America, than there are those who choose to live by their ancestral roots, creating generations who have forgotten their own traditional medicine, for example.<br /><br />Some good sources of independent media:<br />&nbsp;- Rap News<br />&nbsp;- Democracy Now!<br />&nbsp;- Sub Media TV&nbsp; (Stimulator channel esp.)<br />&nbsp;- Anonymous Press<br />&nbsp;- Anarchist News<br /><br />It&#039;s in our hands to surround ourselves with the kind of reality we choose!

				Mainstream Media = Corporate Media&nbsp; :o<br /><br />Their involvement in &quot;news&quot; is for economic gain--entertainment. Sure, there are Jews and Jewish people involved in the media, homo- and heterosexuals, good and bad people. The biggest problem is not race or creed, but overarching goal(s). That goal is to make money.<br /><br />Fox News is what it is today because Rupert Murdoch is out to make money. How do you make money in the Media Industry today? By giving thought-inhibited people distractions and strawmen (and strawwomen). That&#039;s what the media is: a distraction.<br /><br />Primetime = Slimetime.

				Mainstream media is a slick, powerful beast that controls the majority of the masses. TV hits you with adverts and Soapium (opium disguised as sitcoms/soap operas etc). Newspapers/headline TV news programmes hit you with bullshit and spin disguised as &#039;The Truth&#039;. <br /><br />Websites spam you with more adverts and channel you into where they want you to go.<br /><br />It&#039;s an incredibly potent tool that most people will deny has any control over them. That is how you know they are controlled completely, when they deny they&#039;re not.<br /><br />I threw my TV out in 2002. I am wary of what I read online, trying to source a story from as many different sites as possible. I use ad-blockers and do not read newspapers. I try to only read educational material and watch films that peel back the layers of bullshit that the corporations and governments use to keep us quiet and purchasing.<br /><br />Would that I could hack into the TV like V, to try and wake some more people up from their daze.<br /><br />In short, I hate it.<br /><br /><br />

				Since the mainstream media is not permitted to report the truth about the treasonous activities of the U.S. Government’s leadership, the vast majority of Americans remain totally ignorant regarding the most serious matters directly affecting all of us. <br /><br />The only sources of truth available to us now are found via the internet, generally information leaked from some disgruntled insider courageous enough to blow the whistle on these filthy traitors.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst American traitor of all is David Rockefeller. While he may not be an official member of the U.S. Government, he, more than any other American, has greater control over the U.S. Government than any other person, including the president. In America, the Rockefeller family has held this position of power for the last 100 years. Of course, at one time the Rockefeller family owned a controlling interest in ABC, NBC, and CBS making it much easier for them to suppress the truth about their evil activities. <br /><br />David Rockefeller discovered the evil genius Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski perhaps 35 to 40 years ago and, together, they have been scheming to not only take over the world but murder as many “useless eaters” as they possibly can. Useless eaters? Yes, this is a name, along with “expendable containers” they like to use in describing all but about 500 million people on earth. They feel that the earth can only properly sustain about 500 million people, not 6 or 7 billion. Therefore, they feel billions of us need to be terminated. <br /><br />America is now at war in five countries, soon to spread to 7. After that, if Brzezinski’s prayers are answered, both Russia and China will enter the fray as both David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski giggle, excitedly, like a couple of filthy gay pedophile priests.<br /><br />As Brzezinski’s plans for WWIII are working out perfectly, the vast majority of Americans continue to sleep.

				Mainstream media is just corrupt.<br /><br />With the explosion of YouTube and other online video sites, I hope it dies.<br /><br />They&#039;ve already suffered huge losses from of TV advertising. People just aren&#039;t sticking to the Telivision anymore, no more eyeballs (even the whole eyeballs thing is horseshit, holla to the people that know how TRP and average viewership for shows works.) They just download the torrents, why, to skip the advertisements. And it&#039;s such a rude shock to see that 1 hour shows are cut to around 40 minutes with no ads. We don&#039;t even realise that 1/3 of the hour was spent watching bullshit, not the show.<br /><br />Mainstream media. You&#039;re starting to fail. Now google and apple trying to make a NetTV.<br /><br />I hope in the next decade or two torrents rule and TV becomes obsolete. No stupid TV shows. Yeah we all get a laugh and a gag or entertainment out of them. I myself used to have the guilty pleasure of watching Two and&nbsp; a Half Men when I was bored but then I thought, instead of watching mindless eps of two and a half men back to back for 2 hours, I could have read something or watched something meaningful and gained some knowledge, only ever watch movies or tv shows with people over now.<br /><br />I still have a TV but it&#039;s just so I can connect my laptop to a badass 55&quot; plasma and for the occasional console gaming.

				The main stream media is a weapon created to divide, conquer, control &amp; kill... Buyer be ware; don&#039;t play their fool and everything will be fine.&nbsp; Don&#039;t eat sugar or drink alcohol is most important if you want your brain back. Most people I know are to far gone down the rabbit hole if you tell them this they turn against you without even knowing it. This happened to me and when I asked my friend where he got the &quot;name&quot; he called me, he admitted to hearing it on Main Stream talk radio. He quickly took the side of the bubble heads whom accept the state ideal where Slavery is Freedom.&nbsp; Although I&#039;m not worried because we do have this alternative here which can not be denied even by the Bubble Heads once they see the light.&nbsp; &nbsp;The mass exodus of people I expect to migrate over to the .onion nexus is sure to happen soon with all the open spying by the man coming to light as of late; it&#039;s the perfect storm for facebook.onion<br />Not sure how it would work but if you build this site they will come...

				RubberDuckie<br />I agree with you don&#039;t drink alcohol. <br />And facebook.onion is a very good idea. But I dont think it will take off. Because facebook is for people how want there face&#039;s / ID all over the web. And onion is all about not revealing your ID.<br /><br />+ point for you&nbsp;

				this community is more like facebook<br /><br />you can add friends, pm people. get torchat, add them on there for some kinky instant messaging fun. It&#039;s not a one stop shop package like facebook but &quot;convenience&quot; is one of the cruxes of society and one of the reasons people have bought into all current bullshit.<br /><br />Why doesn&#039;t EVERY American question the &quot;war on terror&quot;, I mean how many places have they invaded trying to find &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; and &quot;nukes&quot;. They killed Saddam, they killed Bin Lader, both were pretty much dying when that happened. Wikileaks shows a WHOLE different story of choppers shooting up journalists etc. <br /><br />WHY doesn&#039;t the American public question this last Decade in American History? Hey it&#039;s convenient, let these things sort themselves out. AS LONG AS THE SAND NIGGERS DON&#039;T COME BACK HERE ALL THE 9/11 TRUTH &quot;CONSPIRATORS&quot; ARE LOONEYS AND OF COURSE HEADs OF NATIONAL SECURITY HAVE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS GONE &quot;MISSING&quot; FROM THE OFFICIAL BUDGET WHICH WARRANTS NO FURTHER INVESTIGATION EITHER CAUSE ITS INCONVENIENT AND WASTES MORE MONEY! OH AND FUCK THE YANKS AND THEIR GUNS, THEY MAKE ALL THE SHOOTOUTS HAPPEN....OR IS IT THE GAMES....OR IS IT THE TV SHOWS.....OR IS IT THE AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS.....ARGH ALL OF THE ABOVE FOR CONVENIENCE CAUSE IM TOO LAZy TO GET OFF MY FAT ASS TO FIND OUT<br /><br />I reckon everyone stuffing their faces in Maccas everyday should watch this documentary called Food Inc. Then the hippies should watch the Union Weed documentary. Then they should watch the birth of LSD documentary. Then they need to research the millitary industrial complex<br /><br />Interesting though.....probably a lot don&#039;t know. Are you guys aware that a Hospital is a Military Industrial Complex? That&#039;s why through your parents consent they make an IDENTITY for you. And where are you born? A Ward. You are a Ward of the State! Indebted to them since birth, they create your legal fiction at birth. You&#039;re pretty much &quot;owned&quot; since birth if you &quot;follow the rules&quot;. I can say it here, might get some criticism but I know people out there will want to find out for themselves and look into it. Go to the American/UK/Australian streets and say that........*loony person death stares from all corners*

				What is known as the mainstream media, major news channels and stations are ultimately owned by 6 major corporations.&nbsp; Do they control the content of what people see?&nbsp; If they have an agenda would they use the media outlets to deceive the people?&nbsp; Any idea how many people just believe the news? Millions are deceived.

				Well, to confront the issue of conspiracy and the notion how the media intentionally emphasizes and distracts from certain issues in attempt for control, I don&#039;t entirely agree. Although all I can do is speculate, I legitimately think these people are simply too incompetent to realize the trivial detours they make around what most of us would consider more significant matters. In addition to that, I think that on some sick level, most viewers actually enjoy the hype of what the mainstream media has to offer. I assume most of you are members of social networking sites, and I had no idea about all the shenanigans surrounding this trayvon zimmerman until I saw dozens of people posting about it, meanwhile supplementing their personal, mainly uneducated, opinions on the matter. People eat that drama up and love to give their input. Which perhaps Im doing right now. I do think there are both good and bad in people, in ourselves as well; so i believe there are wrong doers as well as people who are simply doing their job, without regard for what they are promoting in this country. I once compared the news to school gossip, after this realization I began questioning everything, and I am now at the point where I really dont believe anything in life unless I see what I consider valid proof. And even my valid approval could be incorrect. For example, did they ever teach you that your tongue had several different areas of taste? sweet in the front, bitter in the back, salty on the sides or whatever.. Everyone I know was taught this in school. Years later, this turned out to be completely false. There are many other examples of this, such as &quot;we only use 10% of our brain&quot; and you can do your own research if you are really interested. In conclusion, I dont think the media is entirely intentionally evil, but they are easily the most influential form of communication in the world. And when I say media, I dont just mean news, although thats what I was originally focusing on. Movies, music, advertisements, all of that, influences society greatly. Ok Im pretty yakked out hopefully someone will appreciate this. Good morning
