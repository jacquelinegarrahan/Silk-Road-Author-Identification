				So I was wondering if anyone would be able to chime in on any research done/being done in this kinda field. Ive seen a few thigns in docos about each one being used illegally by psychologists to treat patients, but havent seen anything about a combination. Ive found on light doses of LSD, it is a great way to still remain mostly &quot;with it&quot; and can use the drug to access deep parts of the subconcious and the mind itself. <br /><br />Now, with MDMA Ive noticed a similar thing, but not to such a deep level where suppressed memories come to light, but with MDMA my gf and I seem to be able to talk about issue openly, without regret or without judgement, and in turn it helps us move on from these things. Now, I think it would be amazing to see some studies done, into using one psychological session using light doses of LSD to bring sub concious experiences and emotiosn to the surface, and following that up witha&nbsp; subsequent session of MDMA (spaced out accordingly however medically advised) to then return to the issues raised during the LSD experience and work on getting past them and confronting them without fear.<br /><br />Is anything like this being done? You all think Im in a dreamworld? Would appreciate some opinions.<br /><br />S

				I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s been done/it&#039;s being used by some psycho...,<br />but as you wrote yourself: those practices are (for now in most countries) illegal,<br />thus it&#039;ll be very hard to find good, solid information about the therapeutic use of both products (in combination or one after the other).<br />I would suggest you try to dig into the info that is left from the period where it was still legal to use those products for therapeutic reasons. <br />Fadiman might have some info on it (has lots of info about LSD, maybe also in combo with MDMA). <br />Other authors from those days will probably provide you some info... <br />I&#039;d love to know what you find out!<br />Good luck

				This idea is all but far-fetched.<br /><br />Shamans in all traditions of the world have been using psychedelics for easier contact with &quot;the spirit world&quot; - which definitely includes therapeutic use.<br />Ayahuasca,Teonacatl,Peyote all known to be classic psychedelics, I guess we can safely put LSD into this category<br />Soma is unconfirmed - does anyone know what it is? i don&#039;t buy into the fly agaric theory here.<br />In Siberia the shamans use fly agarics, perhaps for the reason psilo shrooms don&#039;t grow there?<br /><br />The catharsis of a &quot;bad trip&quot; is also well-known <br /><br />There are actually a few modern-style psychotherapists in Switzerland who have got a licence to do sessions with psychedelics and MDMA.<br />I saw a video on youtube about this a few months ago, will update once I stumble upon it.<br />There were some references also on the &quot;psychedelic conference&quot; in switzerland.<br /><br />Perhaps there&#039;s more info in old threads on this very forum, too - I am interested !<br />

				I&#039;ve got some good news for you. Research on these matters is not completely dead, thanks to the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS):<br />http://www.maps.org/<br /><br />On this page, they discuss psychiatric use of LSD:<br />http://www.maps.org/research/psilo-lsd/<br /><br />On this page, MDMA:<br />http://www.maps.org/research/mdma/
