				yeah weed for sure. like somebody said, second place would be hard to judge, either heroin, coke or phets.<br /><br />edit: actually i&#039;m gonna go for heroin coz it is so much higher value. a gram of pure heroin is worth $300+ compared to just $10/20 for a gram of weed. so it probably far exceeds cannabis on market value.

				I&#039;m a little surprised. I think it&#039;s important to note that all the numbers mentioned are estimates (or guesses). I would guess the cocaine trade is far more than $130 billion annually, but I have no idea.

Why would your guess trump the UNs estimate, which is presumably based on good evidence and statistics?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For instance, the fairground game where you have to guess the number of sweets in a jar. A guess is just that, whereas an estimate might involve counting the number of sweets in height of jar, and the number in a layer, and multiplying. The estimate is likely to be much more accurate.

				thing is, with coke versus molly, that coke is a more-ish substance, highly addictive etc. molly isn&#039;t really, you can&#039;t roll too many times without serious side effects. with coke, you can just keep going. i suppose that&#039;s half it&#039;s appeal.

				&nbsp; I&#039;m pretty sure if you lump amphetamines and cathinones together, just the stimulant forms, not the psychedelic ones, the market is bigger than cocaine, because there are only maybe 1.5 billion people in the world who can afford cocaine, only about 100 million of which choose to do so, where amphetamine use in Asia, the middle East and Africa would be more than 200 million users.&nbsp; This could be changing as more markets see cocaine being a viable alternative with a rise in standards of living.&nbsp; These are from textbooks I have read, and UN reports, so it could be less.&nbsp; Cannabis is a low-value high-use drug as well, extremely under-reported, maybe 700 million to 1 billion users(the book says 150mil) it could surpass amps and coke, although I suspect the amphetamine market is being splintered by the RC trade, so its apples and oranges.&nbsp; Opiates, having so many legal channels, are relatively low-value, as the entire world&#039;s heroin market is only a few thousand metric tonnes, and production can be decentralized.

				yeah but bear in mind, of the potential 100 million western users, they&#039;re paying upwards of $60-100 a gram for, very often, highly adulterated cocaine. this is probably 50x more than an asian amphetamine user would pay for a gram of some locally produced substance.<br />the market cap is the case in point here, overall actual fiat $ turnover per annum.
