				I can&#039;t imaging to work all my life. I mean, dont get me wrong, I&#039;m a libertarian and wants nobody else to pay for my bills, but when think of working all my life in a crappy corporation or stuff like that i could throw up. Working 40h a week... where&#039;s place to live your life. I see no work to really fulfil myself yet. Right now I&#039;m studying economics an I&#039;m on the way the become just such a lemming like everybody else. I mean, we all have just this one fucking life and my goal is just to have the most fun i can and really be myself. I think that if this fucking system would end and we would have true capitalism we all could deal most of the time with really being ourselves. Human progress would be, and actually somehow allready is, so high, smart people just would have to work a little of their time.<br />How do you deal with all that work vs. life thing???<br /><br />Most people around me are just such idiot who don&#039;t see whats really going on in the world. I&#039;m kinda sick of this situation. <br />Don&#039;t get me wrong again, actually I have a pretty big circle of friends who i really like, but those are all not on my intellectual level and are pretty superficial.

				I know exactly what you mean.<br /><br />That&#039;s why I plan to live forever, that way I have all the time in the universe to learn, explore, and do whatever the fuck I want. Accordingly, I&#039;m going to be spending my time until then trying to become immortal, so I&#039;m going into biomedical engineering. <br /><br />I have a dream where I get a whole world (either this one or another one) to myself and can build a human civilization without any of the huge fuckups we&#039;ve had. <br /><br />The concept of only having so many years and spending a large chunk of them doing stuff that has no intrinsic value or purpose makes me uncomfortable. I don&#039;t like the thought of ending, let alone ending with such a worthless life.

				I like the way both you guys think. Cause im on the same level, and its really really really hard for people to think like this.&nbsp; Everyone else honestly just is completely fine with working 40+ hours a week for life? honestly I hate that thought.&nbsp; I wish we were back in the time in which our only work for the day were the essentials we needed to gather and provide for a community to live.&nbsp; thats all we need our world in the future is going to have no natural resources anymore and at what cost? so we have the greatest technology yeah cool what good is it if we cant live in a healthy world and were destroying civilizations? people who do drugs get it.... coincidence? i think not

				Stay with the positive thoughts, and try to shed the negative ones as often as possible. Like cleaning a cache. Sounds like a lot of youthful dreamers here, and you can turn dreams into realities in many ways. <br /><br />Don&#039;t lose hope!<br /><br />If you need to take a job to keep yourself or family alive and productive, so be it. Even if it&#039;s shoveling shit against the tide! Do it! Don&#039;t let the job define you. YOU define where you want to be in say 5, 10 , 20 years. Then you have a vision. Then you have hope.<br /><br />I did the rock n roll all night+party every day scene in my 20&#039;s, and for some reason was able to survive in an unsuccessful punk/metal band, yet had lots of fun, though eventually economics and human nature got the better of us. Late 20&#039;s started the 9-5, I&#039;ll settle down deal. Used what little I knew about sound and power (electrician) to secure a decent job with a major utility company. Turns out, I was in a &quot;union&quot; shop, and really didn&#039;t know what I&#039;d gotten myself into. Their way of thinking goes against the way I was brought up to think, of every man for himself, and an honest days pay for an honest days work. <br /><br />I soon became aware that I was compromising my own set of rules of right and wrong, with basic things such as honesty, integrity. This Union was sucking the company dry, and now it started to make sense why customers bills were so high! Then to see the upper level management pig like behavior, of such lush opulence and luxurious living. It really made me physically and mentally ill. Nothing against people earning tons of money, I say, you own a company that provides a service? People want that service and will pay you handsomely? Go for it brother! Good for you! <br /><br />Being raised in middle class America in the 70&#039;s-90&#039;s I was accustomed to taking my place in the &#039;rat race&#039;. <br /><br />As time wore on, I really became miserable. I&#039;d attained the highest technical position, but was constantly having to lie, or do less, all to &quot;slow down&quot; to the Union thugs ideas. I liked getting my work done, and getting out of there. None of this &quot;Union break time&quot; bullshit.&nbsp; A common joke was, &quot;Looks like a union job! - How do you know? - One guy doing all the work, and 5 other guys standing there watching him&quot; - Was funny at one time, but had become almost a daily reality. I was offered management positions, but felt I&#039;d really have to sell my soul. Years of watching my own managers kissing the asses of &quot;next in line&quot; up the corporate ladder. - No thanks, not for me. <br /><br />Eventually I snapped. The stress of it all got to me I guess. Somewhere down the line, I&#039;d compromised my principles. I now live on a pension. It&#039;s not much, but I get by, with many creature comforts to be grateful for. I&#039;m happy just to sit and play my guitar. Nothing fancy for me. Leave me alone, I&#039;ll leave you alone, basically. <br /><br />I&#039;m not all there, and I realize this. I hope I helped somebody with this little tale of mine. Not so sure where I went wrong. Reading this back, it looks like, had I been better educated about Unions, and the &quot;trade off&quot; for personal responsibility vs. gang mentality, I never would have taken that job. Had I gone into my own business? I&#039;d be getting hosed by the Socialists that have taken over. I believe in having a safety net for those who slip through the cracks, but this shit is a way of life for some people. Why get up in the morning and try, if the Gov&#039;t will mail you a check with enough money to live on?<br /><br />This dependent class that&#039;s growing exponentially monthly, yearly, is disgusting to me. <br /><br />Well you get my point. Some of you. <br /><br />Good Luck, don&#039;t make the same mistakes I did. <br /><br />Don&#039;t compromise your principles. Assuming you have principles. <br /><br />Don&#039;t allow yourself to be labelled by &#039;them&#039;. You are an individual. Responsible for your own actions. Honest days work for an honest days pay.<br /><br />Do unto others as you&#039;d have done unto you. (not sure of the proper way to say that).<br /><br />Live life to the fullest! - Even if you&#039;re taking a menial job, for now. Take time out to enjoy life. Keep your vision of where you want to go, or be. <br /><br />That&#039;s the best I can pass down to my younger brother (and sisters). <br /><br />Hang in there. Look around you. See what&#039;s getting done, + who&#039;s doing it. There&#039;s money to be made even in the worst economy. <br /><br />- Geez I hope this Road gets going again. - All this mental shit pouring out of my brain. Sorry for the long post. It was like therapy for me- ;)<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />Chip

				@ Chip - You&#039;re pretty together man, for a guy that thinks he&#039;s not. You&#039;re not the crazy one, it sounds like all the assholes in this world became too much for you! I get that shit man! <br /><br />I did that union shit for a while, and you are 100% right about the way. Positive thinking is the way to go. <br /><br />That was a good story, I read the whole thing. It didn&#039;t seem long, cause it was interesting. <br /><br />I see you sitting outside by a tree, playing your guitar, smoking a joint, with a cowboy hat on!

				Travel a lot. Don&#039;t get stuck in one place. Treat life as an adventure and your work as a means to an end. <br /><br />Work on becoming an expert on economics, law, literature etc and learn as many useful skills as possible. You will be able to do any job, anywhere.<br /><br />The U.S. is going on a downhill path. With zero percent interest rates messing with people&#039;s time preferences, it shouldn&#039;t be surprising that depression is becoming so wide spread. <br /><br />

				OP - I know what you mean. I would love to just drop out of &#039;normal&#039; society just now, but can&#039;t as I have a partner who is disabled and dependent on me. Luckily I have fallen on my feet a little; I work an office job, but do things with computers I enjoy about 50% of the time, it&#039;s a small office with only 2-3 people in it at a time (no office politics), I get to choose the music we listen to, and my boss is laid-back and does more coke than I do! In fact, when I had to take a detour when in a big city due to sniffer dogs in the distance (I jumped on a bus) I was just straight-up with him about the weed in my handbag and he was cool with it!<br /><br />Still, working my straight job doing dumb shit that doesn&#039;t really matter gets me down - I could be contributing so much more! ATM I&#039;m planning on getting out of the game in a few ways, so hopefully it won&#039;t be for more than a year or two more. In the mean time knowing that I&#039;m doing it all for the love of my life is enough ^_^

				OP - Agreed 100%.<br /><br />&quot;Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage&quot;<br /><br />SO many people work all week, to drink all weekend to cope with working all week to pay for drinking all weekend to cope with....<br /><br />I never really joined the game. I have been lucky and then some. I have traveled, worked in many alternative places, and had a good life so far. I would like more stability as I get older but at the end of the day I feel quite free.<br /><br />I don&#039;t need much, a dry place to rest my head, some clothes and some food. If you can be happy in your own skin, and not tie yourself down to the rat race you can survive alongside it.<br /><br />Shit, look at all the dealers here on SR, making a life for themselves completely without society. Not sure about the karma of dealing Heroin for a living but each to their own. The karma of buying Heroin everyday isn&#039;t much better I&#039;ll wager.<br /><br />&nbsp;If you tie yourself to a thing or a person, you will have to compromise and too much compromise will leave you tied to your wages and running the rat race.<br /><br />

				David Nobody and a couple of others posting along the similar lines:<br /><br />I see that the system already&nbsp; has you by the balls. You talk about living forever, bio-medicine and shit like that. Are you for real? That&#039;s what the powers that be want you to believe - that old age and death are diseases for which we need to find the cure, and yes of course it will happen by 2045 as the transhumanists say. <br /><br />You cannot have life without death. <br /><br />As for working regular jobs. I agree that most jobs these days, at least office jobs are a joke - people sit on their assess jerking off on some niche internet porn or surf facebook. If you want examples on how to live your life look at how some of the greatest philosophers and artists of the last couple of centuries lived their lives:<br /><br />Wittgenstein - the father of analytic philosophy and modern linguistics, spent his 30s working as a public school teacher. During WW II he quit his job as a Professor at Cambridge and worked as a hospital porter. In his final years he was a gardener.<br /><br />Chopin - one of the greatest composers and piano virtuosos in the history, if not THE greatest. Supported himself by giving piano lessons to rich people&#039;s kids. He died broke. <br /><br />You see where I am going and there are numerous examples like the above ones.<br /><br />As one wise person pointed out in his reply to the main post - it is not the job that defines you. If you don&#039;t have anything to live for - you are already dead, a walking zombie. <br /><br />Don&#039;t let the system try to trick you young man. This life is not about acquiring various gizmos and material things, or green coloured papers. <br /><br />Peace,

				ITT: Forgotten the Face of your Father<br /><br />Unless you are tilling your own garden and creating a sustainable living situation for you, personally and/or family then you will have to work. If you have loved ones that depend on you to provide, then you need to act like a fucking man and work. <br /><br />If you want to sit on your ass and not get up in the morning and expect to have all the necessities of life such as your clothes, shelter, food, water delivered to you while you get high, play guitar and philosophize about The Man, The System, The Grind, The Sheep - Then you are expecting someone with more integrity and determination to produce these for you. This person is probably Brown/Yellow and works for 14 hours a day doing back-breaking labor to provide for a better future for their family. Seeing as you have a computer, are in college and have the cognitive skills to access this website, they would probably be fine with just a small % of how great your life is compared to their own. <br /><br />If you are white, male, educated and able to sleep every night with a full stomach then just shut the fuck up about the soul crushing grind of working. The sense of entitlement in this whole thread is disgusting. <br /><br />Part of being a man is doing shit you don&#039;t want to do. Deal with it, just don&#039;t settle for it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

If you have loved ones that depend on you to provide, then you need to act like a fucking man and work. <br /><br />If you want to sit on your ass and not get up in the morning and expect to have all the necessities of life such as your clothes, shelter, food, water delivered to you while you get high, play guitar and philosophize about The Man, The System, The Grind, The Sheep - Then you are expecting someone with more integrity and determination to produce these for you. This person is probably Brown/Yellow and works for 14 hours a day doing back-breaking labor to provide for a better future for their family. Seeing as you have a computer, are in college and have the cognitive skills to access this website, they would probably be fine with just a small % of how great your life is compared to their own. <br /><br />If you are white, male, educated and able to sleep every night with a full stomach then just shut the fuck up about the soul crushing grind of working. The sense of entitlement in this whole thread is disgusting. <br /><br />Part of being a man is doing shit you don&#039;t want to do. Deal with it, just don&#039;t settle for it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I see your point, but to me this is defeatist. If everybody deals with the hand their given, then there will never be progress. You have to identify what you don&#039;t like about your situation, and move to change that. Yes you have to work unless you want to be a welfare state scumbag or indeed, a troubled artist, but you don&#039;t necessarily have to do something you hate. <br /><br />Best advice I can give (if its relevant or not, i dont know..) - Don&#039;t think too much about your interpretation of what your parents want you to do. Keep it in mind - i mean, lets not piss anyone off if we don&#039;t have to - but if you can do something you like, with the prospect of eventually being able to make ends meet AND being happy - maybe they&#039;ll respect you more for that. Who wouldn&#039;t. <br /><br />Don&#039;t be afraid to change direction - its way better to do it now than when you&#039;re 50. <br /><br />&quot;Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible&quot; <br />Frank Zappa&nbsp; 8)

				Accepting that you have to work (Although I DID point out you can grow your own food and provide whatever amenities you need...) is not something I would quantify as a defeatist attitude. I see it as a humbling experience that gives a person perspective and some fucking empathy for those who were not as privileged to have access to higher education and better standards of living.<br /><br />From my own conclusions there are two intuitive options for picking a career path. First, thank whatever power you see fit that you are even in a position to have a choice. Then decide what is more important. Having a career which is justified by the end (Money, stability, retirement, assets) or having a career that is justified in the act (Travel, learning, teaching, playing, fulfillment).<br /><br />One could spend their entire youth preparing for a peaceful death<br />One could enjoy their youth and end up with a harder death with less regrets<br /><br />If you can have both - you&#039;ve won<br />

				How about a little advice from some one who has been there and is old enough to know how it works and still young enough to tell the truth&nbsp; :o<br /><br />There are 1000&#039;s of ways to live and not everyone is cut out for all of them. You and only you can decide how you want to live the key is to set your path, set your goals, and work to be free.<br /><br />You can go the ho hum route of a 9 to 5 office job (Which in my life has never been 9 to 5, more 7am to 7pm plus weekends) get a mortgage, get a car and car loan, jump in with the living beyond your means crowd and rack up credit card debt so deep you will work only to pay the interest.<br /><br />Or you can blaze a different path! This path could be as simple as finding something you enjoy doing and work at making it your job or as complex as choosing the way your want to live and only working to live.<br /><br />I know a man that does computer work, he worked hard saving every penny to buy a 40&#039; sail boat and now sails around anywhere he wants. Picking up computer work on the islands when he needs a little cash. Turns out there is a lot of computer work for the cruse lines out on the islands of the world and they will rubber stamp a work visa for IT people out there.<br /><br />Or, you could simply live cheep. Where I am you can find land for as little as $800 and in some areas you can build a &quot;tiny house&quot; or a small cabin with out any code issues. Many times costing less than $2k for the house. Then work at whatever you want as there is no rent.<br /><br />You could follow Abby Hoffman&#039;s book titled &quot;Steal this book&quot; (Does that give away my age?) and live free with a flexible moral code.<br /><br />It is all up to you, and there is the rub. You are young and the world is out there waiting for you to find your way. What ever you decided you should start by asking the simple questions &quot;Where do I want to be in 5 years? How about 10 years?&quot; Answer those two questions and you can begin to plan how to get there.<br />There is no right or wrong answer, only answers to how you want to live.

				Ima young buck (early 20s) after workin for a year and a half and seeing people In there 60s workin for under $10 an hour, I pretty much gave up hope on life and quit..... It seems like the goverment forces people to live a certain way, get a minumum wage job, work for 10 years to see a $3 raise, save up 10 more years, buy a house at 40, retire at 70. I can&#039;t seem to get past this so until I see a better way selling dope to pay bills has worked out great! 1 day I hope to have saved enough to start a few legal businesses. But God damn It&#039;s fuckin depressing to think about being 60 and makin $10 an hour!

				When you see the current leaders in the US, breaking law after law, what incentive is there really to &quot;do the right thing&quot;?<br />&nbsp;<br />I used to want to know all the news, and was a political junkie, but with this current batch, and the stenographers in the media posing as reporters, there really is no actual &#039;real news&#039;. <br /><br />I read the Wall St Journal once in a while, that&#039;s it. Catch the news breaks on radio during The Savage Nation. (only guy still not afraid to call it like it is)<br /><br />The more I find out, the more drugs I want to take. It seems the bad guys are succeeding in the takeover of the US. Every year the electorate becomes dumber and dumber. People like to go along with the slime balls in poplular culture, all towing the same party line. <br /><br />So I no longer recognize ANY US law.&nbsp; - I&#039;m aware of them, enough to keep myself out of jail, but I do things I never thought I&#039;d do nowadays. <br /><br />Nothing immoral. I buy a firearm almost every month. No papers, no registration. Why would I want them to know I have them? So they can confiscate them? - Why has Janet Napolitano been buying up millions of rounds of hollow-point ammunition? They&#039;re not even legal in warfare per the Geneva Convention. So what use could Big Sis + the girls have for that? - Who would be wearing Kevlar vests, that they may one day have to &quot;take out&quot;<br /><br />The police? Their own military? <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me started.<br /><br />I&#039;m saving and prepping. <br /><br />That includes drugs. Keep selling, just be careful.

				Can I get some perspectives from people who sell drugs for a living and don&#039;t work a normal job at all?&nbsp; Do you get tired of it all?&nbsp; Do you plan on doing it as &#039;work&#039; for as long as you can?

You and only you can decide how you want to live the key is to set your path, set your goals, and work to be free.<br /><br />You can go the ho hum route of a 9 to 5 office job (Which in my life has never been 9 to 5, more 7am to 7pm plus weekends) get a mortgage, get a car and car loan, jump in with the living beyond your means crowd and rack up credit card debt so deep you will work only to pay the interest.<br /><br />Or you can blaze a different path! This path could be as simple as finding something you enjoy doing and work at making it your job or as complex as choosing the way your want to live and only working to live.<br /><br />I know a man that does computer work, he worked hard saving every penny to buy a 40&#039; sail boat and now sails around anywhere he wants. Picking up computer work on the islands when he needs a little cash. Turns out there is a lot of computer work for the cruse lines out on the islands of the world and they will rubber stamp a work visa for IT people out there.<br /><br />Or, you could simply live cheep. Where I am you can find land for as little as $800 and in some areas you can build a &quot;tiny house&quot; or a small cabin with out any code issues. Many times costing less than $2k for the house. Then work at whatever you want as there is no rent.<br /><br />You could follow Abby Hoffman&#039;s book titled &quot;Steal this book&quot; (Does that give away my age?) and live free with a flexible moral code.<br /><br />It is all up to you, and there is the rub. You are young and the world is out there waiting for you to find your way. What ever you decided you should start by asking the simple questions &quot;Where do I want to be in 5 years? How about 10 years?&quot; Answer those two questions and you can begin to plan how to get there.<br />There is no right or wrong answer, only answers to how you want to live.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I envy the prices of land where ever you live. In Australia you couldn&#039;t even get land in the middle of fucking nowhere for $20,000.<br />I have enjoyed reading everyone&#039;s stories on here.<br /><br />Personally, it is my dream to live somewhere where you do not need to work a full-time job just to get by (house, food, clothes). I would prefer to work 20 hours a week and have plenty of free time to spend with family and friends rather than 40 hours per week and having luxuries that aren&#039;t needed.<br /><br />However, here you really need to work full-time just to support yourself (and family). Everything is insanely expensive in Australia.
