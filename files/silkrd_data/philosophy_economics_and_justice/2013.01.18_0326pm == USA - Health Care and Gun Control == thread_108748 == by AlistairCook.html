				So, without exposing my prejudices I will ask those of you from the US<br /><br />1) Should any person be able to own a gun<br />2) Do you believe in universal health care.<br /><br />Ive got a lot more questions but ... lets just start with those ones.

				Define &quot;Universal Healthcare&quot; for starters. <br /><br />Do you mean &quot;Free&quot; healthcare?<br /><br />State run healthcare? <br /><br />Cuban style healthcare?<br /><br />None of the above? <br /><br />Universal is one of those feelgood buzzwords that really is overused. <br /><br />If you mean &quot;free&quot; (which Obamacare isn&#039;t) - who pays for it??<br /><br />As you can already tell, I&#039;m not for it. - Let&#039;s leave gun control on the back burner for now. Or another thread. <br /><br />Maybe there should be a &quot;Open up a can of worms&quot; section on here! LoL! <br /><br />PS - I do enjoy lively (civilized) debate.

				1)<br />&quot;In a nation of 311 million people, the odds of being killed by a rifle is about one homicide per million people, which is far less than the odds of being murdered by a blunt object. But we don’t hear the media arguing about regulating hammers and clubs. Again, when 99.7% of registered gun owners are law-abiding, gun control is not about guns, it’s about control.&quot; I believe any person should be able to control a gun unless you have a history of violence or are severely mentally handicapped. I personally do not own a gun, but I believe that it is my right should i choose to. It is written in our constitution, that if the government should begin to fail or stop working, it is our responsibility to fix it. That is pretty much impossible these days and definitely will be impossible if our guns are taken from us. <br />I do believe that a lot of things need to change, for example there are only 2500 ATF agents in the country, these agents are responsible for Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and other things. They are supposed to run an inventory on gun shops at least once a year but can only get to each shop once every 20 years because of the lack of manpower. A lot of guns can go missing in 20 years if you have a crooked dealer.....It is also not against the law to sell to someone who may be under the influence of drugs, including alcohol. <br /><br />----Something to think about. I find it harder and harder to trust our government everyday<br />Take a look at this video. it is a rough preliminary conspiracy documentary, but some of the stuff in here has been confirmed by news agencies since. Apparently it was a hoax to get the public behind Obamas gun control plan.<br />----http://www.youtube.com/verify_controversy?next_url=/watch%3Fv%3DWx9GxXYKx_8%26sns%3Dfb<br /><br />*takes off foil hat<br />2)<br />I believe that healthcare is a universal right, and it should be supplied by the government. I do not think that it is right for the US right now, hopefully someday.<br />

				A more timely argument for the 2nd amendment of the US constitution, is the FLU!<br /><br />The flu kills more people every year in the US than guns do. Yet our &quot;trustworthy&quot; government, in a scam with pig pharma pushes the vaccine. - Just helped my ex-wife to the hospital with the flu. The place looked like a scene out of the movie &quot;Outbreak&quot;! - As the tyrant in the White House, never one to let a crisis go to waste, uses a school shooting to pursue his master plan of disarming us.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oh BTW - she had the flu shot. - I never get one, based on my knowledge of nutrition and disease. I felt it coming on this morning, and took 2 grams of Vitamin C (crystalline powder in juice) every hour, until intestinal distress started, then titrated down. - After a great meal of broiled Swordfish, spinach, and brown rice. I feel healthy as a race horse. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Looking back over many communist takeovers by tyrants, Hitler, Castro, Chaves, Mao. - One thread is common. - The promise of Universal Healthcare, and the disarming of it&#039;s citizenry. <br /><br />Just my opinion based on what little I&#039;ve learned.

				I&#039;m for getting people the help they need but of course you can&#039;t force doctors to help people. Unfortunately we live in a monetary system and people need to get paid, so someone has to pay the doctors. I&#039;d much rather my tax dollars being spent on that than on all these illegal invasions. I think we could do that.<br /><br />If someone wants to own a gun, I&#039;m not going to stop them and I don&#039;t think the government should either especially considering how the government spends so much money to arm itself. The government just wants to protect it&#039;s own power and so they create laws to do that. Why should the police be allowed to own guns but not the average citizen? Seems highly unfair to me.<br /><br /><br />

				&nbsp;Im back from cricket training and here to put&nbsp; my 2cents worth:<br /><br />I guess we all see this through our own cultural prism, or should I say prison ... I have only ever lived in a countries where if I need to go to hospital, see a doctor or have ongoing medical treatment I know I will not be bankrupted for the &#039;privelige&#039;. I dont really comprehend a world where this might not be true. In fact it scares me that anyone might think (sorry lips) that eating some spinach and brown rice is all the vaccination you need and will save you from a brown man in the whitehouse. <br /><br />As far as guns, I grew up around them because of the place where I lived but they are now much more strictly controlled. Guns as a tool of trade I can understand. Guns in a shooting club I can understand. Guns because aforementioned brown man is going to reign down armageddon ... me no un-der-stand-ee. Lets face it if armageddon did happen and we needed to overthrow the government I am pretty sure we could storm a bastille somewhere and grab some. <br /><br /><br />Some nuanced answers in here which gives me hope for the broader SR community.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Guns - In the US, there are roughly the same number of drunk-driving related deaths each year as there are gun-related homicides. So an equivalent argument might be that we should a) outlaw high-proof alcohol, and b) require that beer not be sold in quantities larger than six packs. Sound foolish? Not to prohibitionists, and we know how well that worked out. <br /><br />The only way you&#039;ll get my Bud is from my cold dead hand.

				Health Care could be partially free, but not the way society is setup now. If our government wasn&#039;t stealing from us and if private banks weren&#039;t allowed to rack up as much debt as they want and enslaving us in the process we could.<br /><br />Like how the Army will buy contracts for war jeeps, they are pretty much the same thing as a domestic 20K Jeep but they sell them to Uncle Sam for 1/4 million a piece. No one calls this fraud or embezzlement but it is.&nbsp; KBR builds prison camps and MP quarters while their parent company Halliburton drills for oil. If we could stop this kind of shit there would be enough money for health care.<br /><br />This is just one example of the many ways they straight up steal money, but if we could stop the looting there would be money for real social services. I think we could subsidize for people that couldn&#039;t afford health insurance. We should be better to each other.<br /><br />As far as weapons. If you let the government start telling you what you can arm yourself with, you will end up with a rape whistle and a rosary. They don&#039;t give two twat tampons about your ass, they just want absolute power and sheep that will follow them unquestioned.<br /><br />&nbsp; The government can&#039;t do anything right, they lie, cheat, steal, and kill. These are the people who want to tell you what kind of guns you can have? These fucking hypocrites, control freaks want to tell you what&#039;s right from wrong? No. Fuck that. From my cold dead hands.<br /><br />The government has the power to be a good force in the world but right now they&#039;re freedom hating cum stains.<br /><br />I think as technology advances, motherfuckers will be fabricating energy weapons on their 3d-printers. Or even cooler, on their replicators. Let&#039;s see them regulate that. God I&#039;d drown a school bus full of toddlers for a light saber!

				Its good to ponder how it could be, how it should be, and how it is.&nbsp; Bottom line, the one with the control wins.&nbsp; Control is power and if you have the control then you also have the money as well.<br />Whether its guns, healthcare, or anything else, governments have their agendas and its usually not in the best interests of the people.&nbsp; Free countries?&nbsp; Another myth.

				The very term &#039;gun control&#039; says it all.&nbsp; Thats the major agenda on governments list of things to do, control.&nbsp; I think one of the things is too is that when someone is in charge(on top)then there&#039;s only one direction to go after that(down), thats what they fear, losing control and going down.&nbsp; Thats why they try to censor and outlaw free speech, control guns or anything else having to do with true freedom.&nbsp; My message to government today is the middle finger.

When they try to take our guns they will be chewed up, swallowed and shitted out the ass of the American people just like the fucking Red Coats were!

This is not something to take lightly. Criminals always say give us your gun like England and Australia have done. That was dumb as shit! Now you guys are slaves and have to do what you are told!

If that person refuses to move though, then you have to shoot them to flex that illusory power or you lose it. Shooting them makes them into a martyr. Eventually a mob trumps a gun. People follow great leaders and great ideas.

They&#039;re well aware how much that would bother Americans. They would just ban the legal sale of them from gun stores or shows. That would mean a bonanza for anyone owning one right now as their asset would skyrocket.<br /><br />As far as military, historically a government&#039;s military has served the dual purpose of protecting (and plundering) outside threats or targets and protecting government and leadership from internal threats and to control the masses. So for instance if it&#039;s a perceived threat like revolutionaries gunning for leadership to take over government and install anarchy via militant libertarianism, then I see no conflict for military to get involved. When the military decides it has had enough of current leadership or that current leadership has become a liability you end up with a coup d&#039;etat (e.g. Pakistan, still run by military junta in spite of civilian leadership) or a revolution like in Egypt last year.<br /><br />Fortunately in the US we have a 200 year history and tradition of military chiefs being subservient to civilian leadership. There&#039;s no reason for military to overthrow civilian government when every 4 years there are processes by which heads of state can and do change, especially if unpopular they will be defeated at the polls.

				We must have gun control to prevent people from shooting the state agents coming to collect the debt to the socialized healthcare system! <br /><br />from a moral standpoint health care is not something that should be provided by society by force. Nobody has the right to point a gun at you and tell you to give your money to some sick person. That said, it is good for society if people voluntarily give money to provide for the health of humanity. Single people have donated billions of dollars to healthcare, Bill Gates immediately comes to mind. Having universal health care for everybody is a goal that we should strive towards, but it should absolutely not be paid for by slaves.

In the big government socialized democracies of Europe health care is viewed by many as a universal right that government has a responsibility to guarantee all citizenry. Not just health care either. Rights to pensions and child care are seen in some of these countries as universal rights too.<br /><br />In the US we tend to view health care as a commodity that involves costs and have a much narrower view of what the government should provide for its citizens. <br /><br />Then of course there&#039;s the militant libertarian view where health care should be strictly privatized medicine, government shouldn&#039;t even exist much less be a guarantor of anything, and &quot;rights&quot; are determined by whose property you are on. :)

You end up getting drugs made available due to political reasons, through interest groups lobbying for their particular cause. Then you&#039;ve got the health boards which create the &#039;post-code lottery&#039; of which drugs are made available to you, and on top of that the various quasi-governmental agencies and institutes regulating, appraising and approving drugs. It&#039;s just a big mess. Even the best of central planners cannot make the right decisions.

				Gun control and healthcare, two issues that may never get fully resolved.&nbsp; There are, however, a couple good sources on the dark web for guns.&nbsp; I&#039;d say get some and we can control our own guns, we don&#039;t need the governments permission, fuck em.

				<br /><br />Te primary function of governments is to protect citizens from harm and ensure that they remain healthy.<br /><br />The US government lets everyone shoot each other and supports a medical system that ensures that the USA is behind Libya and Turkey in the World Health Organisation league tables.<br /><br />The only reason poor Americans aren&#039;t rioting in the streets is because:<br /><br />a) They are, in the main, too obese and therefore don&#039;t have the energy<br /><br />b) They have been subject to right wing propaganda for so long that they have actually been indoctrinated into thinking that the &#039;socialist&#039; policies aimed at spreading wealth more fairly are something to be feared<br /><br />c) Unlike most democratic governments that live in fear of their citizens, Americans are frightened of, and deeply mistrust,&nbsp; their own government<br /><br />Indeed, some Americans have become so nihilistic and scared that they have literally retreated into the mountains with their guns, supplies and conspiracy theories.<br /><br />There is only one conspiracy that Americans need to fear and that is the &#039;lie&#039; that is American freedom and democracy. <br /><br />Come on American brothers and sisters. Time to get ANGRY!!
