				Spend a few hundred and fill up baggies with 0.5gm of cannabis in each.<br /><br />Staple them all to a little cardboard stand with a spiel on the health benefits of the plant.<br /><br />In the middle of the night, visit a few neighbourhoods (both conservative and liberal) and place them at various spots. The table at the cafe. On top of the vending machine at the train station. At the local post office, library or community centre.<br /><br />How would people react? Would people take any?<br /><br />Do you then take it a step further and list an anonymous email address for people to email back a thank you with a short description of how much they enjoyed the cannabis?<br /><br />I&#039;m tempted to try this.

				Someone would steal the whole stand.<br /><br />Once I found a £5 note in the coin tray of a public phone box. It had a note with &quot;Spread a little love and happiness&quot; written on it. So I bought my train ticket home with it and gave the £2 change to a homeless beggar. I was going through a tough time in my life back then, and that little random act of kindness gave me hope that their are people in this world that care more about others than they do about money. I would have loved to have found that person so I could tell them how, between me (at that time I was so down on my luck) and that beggar, their generosity couldn&#039;t have had more of an impact.<br /><br />So, I would say go through with you random act of kindness, you may just need to work on the details. But you could have a greater impact than you think, you may just never find out about it...

				I personally wouldn&#039;t take anything, for fear of being apprehended by a team of DEA agents who had been staking out the stand. It is a nice thought though (no sarcasm). Maybe try handing out edibles to homeless people? Or real food, it really would be up to you

				IMO- there are much kinder things that can be done without the need to gift any materialistic items.... it would be much more random and much kinder if you were to sit down with a homeless man and talked with him, asked him for insight, share some of your own, etc... this not only would be kind and probably make the man feel much more confident in his being, but i would imagine it could be incredibly beneficial to your own mental state! Try picking up a hitch hiker, ive been one before and trust me it means waaaaaaaaay more to someone that a stranger would gladly assist in your journey then if you were to receive a bag of weed or even money... much &lt;3

				It is a noble idea to sit and converse with a homeless person and in my experience some tend to have an outsider perspective that can be quite insightful however I recommend you choose your potential new friend with some reproach. <br />&nbsp;I ounce got in step with a &quot; homeless&quot; person who seemed to have that mild lunatic fringe quality that can lend itself to some interesting discussion. We bonded over a boosted bottle of wine (my compliments) and dug in for some philosophical talk. <br />&nbsp;What I was sharing was something to the affect of, god is something that resides in yourself as your own intuition and can be known. Well thats about the time he kind of freaked out and and started yelling &quot;YOU DONT KNOW GOD MAN!!) and started to make a move on me. Unfortunately the only appropriate response I could think of was to bounce the bottle of his head and get out of there. It did make a nice ringing sound though.

				I&#039;m a believer in micro finance and thus charities that are established to facilitate this get most of my attention. I&#039;m middle class if we need to get financially relative, so the few thousand I give out each year is fairly insignificant to me but huge to other entrepreneurial spirits out there in the less developed world. I don&#039;t give homeless people coins because there are better uses of my money for the &quot;greater good&quot;.<br /><br />The purpose of my exercise is not to boost the material wellbeing of others. It is to do my part in contributing to the story that Silk Road is trying to tell. This idea of personal liberty and a quiet, confident belief that we can be responsible for exploring our own consciousness. People can often live in a daze like state but these sorts of things can be brought into focus fairly sharply by dangling something in front of people when they don&#039;t expect it.<br /><br />
