				Hello travelers .. so good to find SR since I haven&#039;t been around a close group of friends that trip in a long time.. life has spread us away but the Road here unites us all<br /><br />I see a lot of talk of ego-death with LSD..&nbsp; that isn&#039;t really true.&nbsp; &nbsp;What you are seeing is the removal of your environmental personality.&nbsp; Your instinctual personality stays and is re-enforced.&nbsp; Most people have a crafted ego though from their environmental experiences so when they say ego-death, that is what&#039;s really happening.&nbsp; You take a vacation from any false ego you created from attaching to your scene, or environment<br /><br />For those of us who never let go of independent thought, and only relate oneself to their instinctual persona, we gain strong waves of validation of ourselves as we get to relax from shielding the environment from influencing our actions and beliefs.&nbsp; Our egos actually show a high level of confidence in this state..<br /><br />hope this allows more people to gain insight into their true self and to &#039;bring back&#039; themselves after their trip is over and engage life with it more and more

				I think the same way, I have always believed many people are who they are because of the reflection they see when they interact with others..its that reflection that makes people do or say things that they feel they need to do to fit in to this world .Its only when we can remove all those layers, can we see who we are...The farther away you are from yourself the bigger the ego loss.. Sometimes it takes many trips to crack that shell.&nbsp; <br /><br />But in either event ego loss is ego loss...crafted or not...when you are well grounded, having ego loss is like reminding yourself that you are not the center.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;

				All I can say is that I&#039;ve experienced a complete abandonment of Ego when I had too much (20 hits)&nbsp; of Acid. I was gone, there was nothing in control anymore. When I lost my ego, I couldn&#039;t see; I thought I was blind. At once I was experiencing another reality, one without decisions just reactions (which I wasn&#039;t completely aware of). The blindness turned into constantly shifting synesthesia.&nbsp; I was aware of my surrounding but seeing through sound, hearing through smell and then that would change -I&#039;d see through touch, or my thoughts were strong smells. It&#039;s very hard to describe and there was a period where I blacked out and I have no memory. When I started coming back to reality I found that I destroyed my apartment, and I thought that God was punishing me and I was in hell.<br /><br />It&#039;s not completely without benefit.&nbsp; View &quot;Journey of the Wounded Healer&quot; by Alex Grey.

				I went to a very good psychiatrist after that.&nbsp; There is a saturation point with LSD. A point at which you can not go any further. Twenty hits was well beyond that point. It&#039;s possible to build up a tolerance, slowly. The case with my Ego Death was not one of those instances. I took 20 hits at once (after buying a sheet) and the amount I did previously to that day was 1 hit the weekend before. <br /><br />The ego that died was the ego that did those 20 hits. Basically, I was trying to show off my toughness to a crowd of people. &quot;See, I can do this.&quot; That kid is dead. My life has been completely altered by what happened on that day. I really can&#039;t say anymore because I don&#039;t want some DEA agent to figure out who I am.<br /><br />Some people call it a &#039;bad trip&#039;. That is not really what happened. It was a mediocre trip but I took way too much. <br /><br />Nothing would have changed my mind before I put those tabs on my tongue. I was full of reckless fun. However, if you do proceed, just be cautious. Have some sober friends ready to hold you down, for instance.

				Before I joined SR I didn&#039;t know about terms such as ego death and breaking through.<br />I had tried LSD before but it was more about partying and so. After some orders I made I realized that lsd isn&#039;t about partying but something deeper. Although I haven&#039;t ever tried more than 200ug of LSD I have never had such feelings of ego deaths. I don&#039;t know what will happen if I take stronger doses but hopefully in the future I will try. <br /><br />The last 2 months I have been experimenting with DMT. Since money is not an option, I can&#039;t buy a GVG pipe and therefore I use the machine method. I have done almost 1-1,5g and still not achieved this so called break through. Almost all tries are full of visuals and uncontrollable thoughts. My best experience was one day when I did DMT after 6 hours I had taken a 140ug LSD tab. That was something strong! It was not any kind of ego death but only a deep understanding of what was important for myself this period. If anyone is interested you can read my report here:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=179972.msg1409935#msg1409935<br /><br />I wont lie, but terms such as ego death and break through had got my attention for a while and really tried hard to experience those. In the end, I have come to the conclusion that the more you try to achieve these terms the more impossible is to experience them. Psychedelics are mind altering substances and when you try to force so deep emotions usually you fail. Finally psychedelics should be used when you are in a state of calmness and awareness and not when you really trying to achieve such deep terms. Meditation always helps.<br /><br />At least that is what I have understand from my experiences. <br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz

				Greetings Adamiz<br /><br />As I said in the first post, not everyone will get an ego death.. it depends on how your main ego is constructed.&nbsp; If it has anything to do with exterior/environmental constructs, you may very well experience ego-death as that is removed and you are left with a self identity that has been neglected<br /><br />If you feel a bit empowered and assured on LSD, then your main ego is based on your instinctual personality or &#039;pure state&#039;.&nbsp; All the chains around you are tossed to the side during your trip, but not your ego since it isn&#039;t attached to those chains<br /><br />As for DMT breakthrough, I think it will call you when you are ready.&nbsp; I haven&#039;t broken thru either but I have gain strong messages bith times I have dosed.. and once was on LSD too which is really the way to go I believe<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I never understood what ego death is suppose to mean. I heard a term called &quot;Ozeanische Selbstauflösung&quot; a couple years ago, the first word kind of gives me some insight when I think about the ocean and the water. So you are not able to distinguish from you and the outside world with the feeling that everything that exists is one, would that be a valid description?<br /><br />People seem to love it generally, I read may posts here saying it was a good experience for them. I&#039;m super scared I have to say. I had my first LSD experience about 2-3 weeks ago with heavy candy flipping and at the end I had about 400µg which I can hardly believe, maybe it was the super heavy combinations with MDMA and absurd amounts of cannabis that suppressed the LSD a lot or I wasted it a bit by only taking 1/4 or 1/2 of a blotter at once and then waiting for ... hours before taking more, I don&#039;t know.<br />This does not mean it was bad, oh no it wasn&#039;t, it was the most monumental, warm, safe, seemingly infinitely beautiful, paradox and magical thing I ever had the luck to experience.<br /><br />Also this is about as imaginable as things like the outside of the universe or the inside of a black hole for the human mind, at least for mine. I guess it is one of these things you have to experience to understand them. But that is nothing new when it comes to psychedelics. ;)

I would think that LSD is safer even tho it lasts so much longer. I kind of get it that the short effect duration makes people say it&#039;s safer than [insert substance here]. But on the other hand if it is so uber intense and has these extreme time misconceptions while on it than I don&#039;t think it is more safe than other psychedelics.<br /><br />Maybe someday I&#039;ll find out by myself.

				Without any actual scientific knowledge, I would say yes. I think it is safer than LSD. Although LSD has nothing so dangerous, it is as well one safe substance. But still, I believe DMT is 99% safe. The 1% is for the mental shock of the astonishment you might have :)<br /><br />Still, I don&#039;t have anything to prove my words. My opinion is based on what I have read and what other experienced psychedelic users around here say.<br /><br />Let&#039;s hope somebody can enlighten us on this matter.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Adamiz

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personally, &quot;Ego Death&quot; never really meant anything until I tried psilocybin for the 3rd or 4th time, ate about 6gm of cubes, and even though I had tripped on LSD many times, even put into a trance state, and lost all trace of ego, the &#039;ego death&#039; from shrooms was something I was not prepared for, much more profound in nature.&nbsp; The self ceased to exist as an object, I felt very, very, alone, so much that I questioned my own existence and whether the event was even happening, during a 3 block walk to some steps where I sat, alone in the universe.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the angry mob of&nbsp; people who had threatened my friend, which catapulted me into this state, and in my hasty escape, I found ego death in the in-between of a very safe place, a courtyard in an apt. building where we knew everyone, out onto the cold streets alone.&nbsp; &nbsp;I returned to find a beer and drink it, swatted away a camcorder, and told my friend that I was &quot;Tired of contemplating my existence, and getting drunk.&quot;&nbsp; This was when I lost it, not during the 600ug solo acid trip, not in the trance, and certainly not through any other experience up until that point.

				Most of my experience with high dose states of mind comes from DMT rather than LSD.&nbsp; So my experience may differ quite a bit from your own Bluto.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think the experience itself can be described because when you&#039;re that high on psychedelics you can&#039;t form words or associate concepts appropriately.&nbsp; Your sense of me and not me breaks down into monism.&nbsp; I&#039;m not even sure ego death is the right word as it implies the experience is without your ego when, for me at least, it&#039;s more like your ego has been gently dissolved (or violently if I&#039;m not letting go) into the fabric of everything.<br /><br />Why I think this is so profound is because it allows people to see that when all of their ideas, thoughts, and concepts about things are gone there&#039;s still something there.&nbsp; What this means is..&nbsp; well it has as many different meanings as their are people on the planet and everyone is going to see it differently.&nbsp; Which is why I find the topic kinda silly.&nbsp; Not because I don&#039;t see Waterwalker&#039;s perspective but because he dismisses all other perspectives as misconceptions.

				lsd is most certainly capable of ego dissolution. it just takes a much higher dose than with tryptamines. low to common doses of lsd tend to make your ego very permeable, without dissolving it. if you truly believe you cannot experience ego death on lsd, then you haven&#039;t done a large enough dose. :P

				So, is an ego death a positive or negative experience? I&#039;ve heard some people say that it was an enjoyable experience for them, while others say that it was sad, or even terrifying. I don&#039;t believe that I have experienced this phenomena yet, even though one time I took 600 micrograms of LSD by mistake and freaked the hell out. I still knew who I was, even though i was like babbling incoherently to my friend.

				Ego death, in my opinion, is a state of profound relaxation were the lines between you and not you blur.&nbsp; There&#039;s no sense of danger because there&#039;s nothing outside of yourself to threaten you and there&#039;s really no you to be threatened.&nbsp; Just one giant universal orgy of awesomeness.<br /><br />On the other hand, and again this is just my opinion, most people are wired into a survival trip as Hunter S. Thompson would say.&nbsp; We&#039;re literally wired to constantly be alert, on the look out for danger, constantly analyzing rather all the &#039;not-mes&#039; are a threat to us.&nbsp; Letting our guard down so completely can be terrifying.&nbsp; Because it feels like surrendering to death and really you are.&nbsp; You&#039;re surrendering to the experience and allowing whatever happens to happen.<br /><br />This is why set and setting are so important.&nbsp; The person needs to be in a mind set and environment that they can get really comfortable, let go, and relax.<br /><br />Now all of that said I imagine a high enough dose could force ego death on someone.&nbsp; In which case you&#039;d probably have a flux of terrifying vs. relaxed states as your consciousness flirts with letting go which could be very frightening when you have no idea who you are, where you are, etc. etc. because you&#039;re entire universe has been over run by fractals.&nbsp; For some this flux state feels like dying (white light experiences, life flashing before their eyes, etc. etc.).&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand the first time I really let go was the first time I smoked DMT because it was so intense I had to just let go and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Another way of thinking about it is like a roller coaster.&nbsp; You strap in for the ride and once you&#039;re on the ride there&#039;s really no getting off.&nbsp; You can either let go and have a good time or spend the length of the trip fighting the experience and wishing it was over.&nbsp; The higher the dose the bigger the roller coaster and the more terrifying it will be for some but the more amazing it will be for others.&nbsp; It&#039;s all a matter of your willingness to let go.<br /><br />Anyway that&#039;s my experiences with it.

				&nbsp; Let us not forget that ego loss =/= extreme depersonalization.&nbsp; &nbsp;I think you can have depersonalization, it is certainly an element of ego loss, in that you are separated from your construct-laden self, but depersonalization is a dissociative disorder, however temporary, and on its own does not particularly lead to the kind of profound experience of oneness with the universe that we are talking about here.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even know how many times I&#039;ve experienced true ego-loss, maybe 20 times, out of ~120 trips(I lost count a long, long time ago.)&nbsp; A few times I got so depersonalized that I had serious problems relating to anything, let alone the universe.&nbsp; Just a bit of food for thought.&nbsp; <br />

				Interesting thread.<br /><br />As my name states; I am a &quot;crazy&quot; person. A psychological outlier, my experiences are abby normal to say the least. This applies to psychedelics, interpersonal relations, watching a sunset, and simply thinking about what to have for lunch. <br /><br />For some people an acid induced &quot;ego death&quot; is a very bad thing. Rather than the parts of themselves reintegrating into a (better) person they fly off into the either or end up in a jumble on the floor... and stay that way. Hell, there are people that shouldn&#039;t smoke pot. And yes; for some people it can be a wonderful and transformative experience.<br /><br />I&#039;m closer to the OPs description than to the &quot;ego death&quot; model. But I can see where the wording came across as a bit condescending. Although no more so than the &quot;no ego death = you are a small dose light weight&quot; crowd. There is a much greater variety in mental OS and architecture than most people think. <br /><br />Krazy(s)<br /><br /><br />

				Yes this thread was created to shine a light, not degrade.&nbsp; But many thin skin people exist who get offended unless you approach with a list of hand holding disclaimers. That&#039;s all I will say about the dust up here.<br /><br />With the current circumstances of SR, normally I wouldn&#039;t bother logging in at all anymore, but this thread deserves what I promised Bluto.&nbsp; And I see the others have chimed in to bring this back on course.<br /><br />Here we go, hope you are ready....thanks for the recent comments, they mean a lot. Save them, and express them...<br /><br /><br />Ever have a book for years, decades and never open it?&nbsp; And you don&#039;t open it until it is time in your life to finally read what it has to say to you.&nbsp; Last week this happened to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;A book published back in the early 70&#039;s.&nbsp; The second Seth book.&nbsp; The cover used to freak me out with the distorted picture of the author Jane on it.&nbsp; But I always kept it.&nbsp; Seth was channeled by her, and her husband wrote everything down.<br /><br />There is one chapter about multi dimension personalities and it nails it completely.&nbsp; As I said, I just read it last week..&nbsp; Years ago I would never of made sense of what it wrote, but after reading what Bluto wrote, I was ready to understand it.&nbsp; please, everyone in this thread go get it.&nbsp; I will try to summarize, but currently I am not near the book...<br /><br /><br />Action is what is.&nbsp; Being conscious of it creates the impressions. Time only means something to the impressions in environments that include time as a construct; one example is our physical universe.<br /><br />Ego is just an impression to the reactions your action have in the physical.&nbsp; You have a personality layer underneath that which is tied to your conscience.&nbsp; That is the personality I have mentioned in the OP.&nbsp; It is still your identity but without the binding of the memories that your ego layer holds onto. In knows of them, but knows they all can be changed.&nbsp; In fact the past can be re-experienced and &#039;changed&#039; just as your future circumstances can change course in this layer.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another layer of personality is deeper; and this is where Bluto and others that feel complete meltdown of self have experienced.&nbsp; Here I believe the &#039;machine elves&#039; is the best expression of.&nbsp; Where you see and create entire realities not of this world or any rules at all.&nbsp; It is pure action onto action, etc <br /><br />Again, please read the text, not just my foggy summary of it.<br /><br />But it does show the difference of what my first post mentioned.&nbsp; That losing your top level is not the real dissolve.&nbsp; If you lose the top layer, and free yourself to your middle layer, you can feel stronger, more &#039;attached&#039; about your true self.<br /><br />But if you do go full Bluto as I coined earlier, you will lose touch with yourself and swim in uncharted waters.. as he did well to explain as best as anyone.&nbsp; I have yet to go that far and one day I will walk there<br /><br /><br />If this last layer is what Jhancock meant earlier, then he should of offered it instead of looking to derail the thread.. I see he contributed recently, thanks for that.<br /><br />be safe all, and remember, we can sail anywhere..
