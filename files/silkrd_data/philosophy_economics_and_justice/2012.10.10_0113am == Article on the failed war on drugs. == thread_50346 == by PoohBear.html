				It&#039;s funny how history repeats itself.&nbsp; We fought that war (US Revolution) for the same reason we fight this war ( on drugs).&nbsp; Because it was felt and some still feel they the right to control others.&nbsp; No matter the tyrant whether actual, an institution,&nbsp; or philosophical the people will always rise up.&nbsp;

				Well I admit, I&#039;ve never really been to Britain so I&#039;m going to take your word for how the courts handle drug offenders because as you said, I only understand them on paper. I want to make it clear I am in no way pro-america and those overly ignorant patriots bother me just as much as they bother you.<br /><br />As far as our foreign policy goes, your government tags along with everything we do and justifies Americas actions as well. We take the fall for most of the bullshit (because we pretty much start it) but your country benefits off our bullshit and happily engages in it. As far as taxes go I was under the impression that your government taxes its citizens way higher than ours and even the poor fall into a higher tax bracket. <br /><br />Honestly, I realize I&#039;m probably fighting a losing battle because the only country I can really talk about is the US, I&#039;ve been to most of Europe but that doesn&#039;t mean I &quot;get&quot; there political system.

				StExo no offense, but are you actually from the UK?&nbsp; You&#039;re stating there are no radials or fanatics in the UK.&nbsp; Where do think the skinhead movement started? albeit it wasn&#039;t aligned with neo-nazism at the beginning, but the evolution can be traced to London.&nbsp; What about the violence between Protestants and Catholics?

				I would disagree, seeing as how Israel was established by GB, fast forward to today and GB is as involved in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Egypt, Iran and East Africa as any of the other first world nations. The only reason they are there, oil, natural resources and control. <br /><br />GB is not blameless sorry, though I will say, the kommunist states of amerika are the new kid on the imperial block. ;) <br />&nbsp;;)

The violence you talk of is in Ireland (Not N.Ireland, just Ireland) and is not part of GB or our policies. IRA is also barely in our scope but that stems from the previous argument also and N.Ireland seem to be happy where they are and Ireland is happy where they are, it&#039;s the in between causing the trouble who are old fashioned Irish guys still bitter about the whole situation, exactly like the Falklands and Argentina.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t understand what you meant by the following statement. Particularly the first half of the sentence. <br />&quot; Lets face it, most of what you&#039;ve said traces back to the UK because most of the US population stems from here&quot; <br /><br />For the sake of clarification the mainland USA was formed from British, French, Spanish, and Mexican Territories.&nbsp; It would be correct to state that the majority of the population are &quot;white&quot;, but this is just a general term that means they are of white European descent. To state that most of the US population stems from the UK would be incorrect.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />As far as the statement, &quot; The violence you talk of is in Ireland (Not N.Ireland, just Ireland)&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The Troubles refers to approximately three decades of violence between elements of Northern Ireland&#039;s nationalist community (who mainly self-identified as Irish and/or Roman Catholic) and its unionist community (who mainly self-identified as British and/or Protestant). Use of the term &quot;the Troubles&quot; has been raised at Northern Ireland Assembly level, as some considered this period of conflict to have been a war.[18][19][20][21][22] The conflict was the result of discrimination against the Nationalist/Catholic minority by the Unionist/Protestant majority[23] and the question of Northern Ireland&#039;s status within the United Kingdom.[24][25] The violence was characterised by the armed campaigns of Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups.&quot;<br /><br />*Wikipedia
