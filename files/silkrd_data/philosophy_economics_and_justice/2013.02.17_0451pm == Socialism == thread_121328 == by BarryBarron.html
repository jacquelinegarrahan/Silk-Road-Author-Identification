				I&#039;ve seen several people claim that socialism is misrepresented, that opponents do not understand what they are arguing against.<br />Here is an opportunity for you &#039;comrades&#039; to clarify some misconceptions.<br /><br />Two points I want to start with:<br />Do you accept the labour theory of value?<br />How does a socialist economy overcome the problem of a lack of price signals as generated in the free market through the interaction of market actors?

We can discuss all three issues separately if you wish but I honestly think it&#039;s quite clear from my OP that&nbsp; I&#039;m talking about &quot;socialism, comrades, the labour theory of value, and a socialist economy&quot;&nbsp; not a mixed economy. As I say I&#039;m happy to discuss that though.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121328.msg835198#msg835198">Quote from: Joey Terrifying on February 18, 2013, 02:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the question is not whether or not socialism is &quot;good,&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now, I never used the word &quot;good&quot; - so I don&#039;t know why you are putting it in quotation marks&nbsp; ???<br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121328.msg835198#msg835198">Quote from: Joey Terrifying on February 18, 2013, 02:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the question is in which circumstances and to what extent should it be implemented.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Brilliant question. I would broaden it to: What are our goals and what is the best way to achieve them.<br /><br />Let&#039;s take your public schools example. You think this is a circumstance in which a socialist policy should be implemented&nbsp; because it is the best way to achieve our goals. <br />Well I have to ask what are your goals for education and why is a socialist policy the best way to achieve them? <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121328.msg835198#msg835198">Quote from: Joey Terrifying on February 18, 2013, 02:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">but whether you like it or not, socialism is an integral part of western society.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well by integral you must mean that socialism is necessary for western society to function. I don&#039;t actually disagree with that. Socialism is an integral part of the way today&#039;s society functions. You say it is necessary for the good parts of western society. I say it&#039;s responsible for the bad parts.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121328.msg835198#msg835198">Quote from: Joey Terrifying on February 18, 2013, 02:27 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nice cliche.

				i think socialism is misunderstood yes.<br />it&#039;s culture and public attitudes. if they were to implement any progressive socialist welfare policies in the uk, the daily mail would go mental about scroungers. that&#039;s pretty much all they think of; unemployment benefits, housing, immigrants and scamming disability. people being able to live for free.. they don&#039;t think about the fact that there&#039;s universal access to healthcare, education, leisure facilities and the govt topping up wages of those on low incomes with tax credits because technically the minimum wage doesn&#039;t provide enough to live on.<br />i&#039;m not a socialist. i&#039;m a neo libertarian capitalist if you want a label. i do think the welfare system provides good safety net to those who need it. i&#039;m pretty open minded and not an expert. i also think capitalism is pretty flawed too but really what&#039;s perfect?

				I don&#039;t want to defend all aspects of socialism. Pure socialism is a utopian fantasy, which has been tested in various practical implementations (communism f.ex) many times, with varying degrees of success (lets be honest, it has never really been successful). But it works wonders on stuff like crimerates. Economically is difficult to compete with the free market. When politics becomes a game of generating revenue, capitalism wins, hands down. The problem is the capitalistic delusion, that fulfilling your materialistic desires, is somehow a key component in living a happy life.

				as a huuuuge simplification; capitalism is more about generating capital for individuals or businesses whereas socialism is more ensuring every member of a society is taken care of. kind of the opposite.
