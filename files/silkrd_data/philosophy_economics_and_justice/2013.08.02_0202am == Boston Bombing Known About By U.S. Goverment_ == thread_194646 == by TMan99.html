				Am I the only one here who believes that the Goverment knew about the Boston Bombings before they happened? <br /><br />With the massive survalince the Goverment HAD to know about this being planned, I believe that they did know weeks/months before hand but let it happen for feardom to spread and so they can control us even more by using the we need to stop terrorisim excuse.<br /><br />The american goverment does not give a shit about its people, all they want is more control. They decided it would be in their best interest to allow the the bombings to go on so they can put more laws in place in the future to fuck over the american people using terrorisim as an excuse.<br /><br />Maybe I am late on board, but who else believes this?

				go read some more infowars... I mean yeah the gov&#039;t is a bunch of corrupt scum, but what would they get out of letting a bombing happen? If they really knew about it beforehand they would have arrested them and then proclaimed how great the NSA is that it would allow them to capture would be terrorists.. but you know fuck logic

				I disagree 100%<br /><br />The goverment had tons to gain and did not loose anything. If they were to stop them before the bombings happened it would just show up on the local news about how these guys were going to make a bombing and nothing more would come out of it.<br /><br />Fear has come from the bombing and this gives the goverment so much more power, as people will be more inclined to let the goverment tread on them now and do what they want to &quot;protect&quot; them.

				I&#039;m not sure about the Boston bombings because I haven&#039;t read much about it, but it wouldn&#039;t surprise me.<br />I think they definitely planned the September 11, 2001 attacks though.<br />As soon as it happened, it was all over the TV and radio, etc non-stop for days and they immediately blames Al-Queda.<br />They had obviously planned to blame them.<br /><br />The Government has too many secrets. Everything should be transparent, but what has surfaced already is probably not even the tip of the iceberg.

				As pathetic and deplorable as govt scum are, like someone else said they have nothing to gain from letting a bombing take place. As much as those goons love a &#039;manhunt&#039;, probably cause most of em are closet case homos, I refuse to believe that they let it happen. <br /><br />In reading about it it became clear that there were sufficient warning signs that one of the bombers had become radicalized, the feds failed to act on it properly. Are they incompetent assholes? Most likely. Are they really so evil that they would let it happen though, I dont think so.

				All computer data and telephonecalls are stored.<br /><br />Then is filtered by software that looks for certain words.<br /><br />Then all the phoneconversations are screened again from hdd1 to hdd 2 and sexyalconversations etc are left out.<br /><br />From hdd 2 it&#039;s is going to one of the 22.000 people who listen to the recorded conversations.<br /><br />If the conversations are not in English but in a language that is not even spoken by 100.000 people, then it can take some time.<br />The NSA is in need of people who do understand very rare languageses, so they can screen quicker.<br /><br />33 free days and about 200.000 dollar a year. You can say what you want, but it is a nice salary<br /><br />So ontopic yes they knew. Only to be to late. They will know everything afterwards. Before it happens the NSA has to rely on software that does recognize the upcoming attack.<br /><br />If an attack is changed in sex, the software might have put the priority wrong.<br /><br />When are we going to have sex or when are we going to have a &quot;&quot;bombblast&quot;&quot; makes a big difference for voicesoftwarerecognitionsystems. Even when the software sees it as probably dangerous the human at the end of the screeningsproces could be fooled.<br /><br />We use a t-shirt when we mean cocain and cd&#039;s if it is heroin.<br />As long as the otherone on the other end of the line knows what I mean, it&#039;s fine.<br /><br />Yep I told to bring 1 t-shirt and 2 cd&#039;s, so what?<br />The NSA has to know what I mean by a cd or a t-shirt, otherwise this info is useless.<br /><br />The fact you will read anything they know, doesn&#039;t mean that the L.E.agency&#039;s could have reacted in time to prevent the terror attack.

				This isn&#039;t really a plot that I would say they MUST have known about. The two brothers could have very easily planned this all in person, never talking about it over the phone or internet. The information to build the devices could have been gotten over Tor. Even if they used google to get the info on the clearnet, it would not be a dead giveaway as to the actual plan. Especially not the time and place.<br /><br />The government is watching the internet and the phones, but they are not omnipotent.

				I suppose they could have got away with it if it was planned perfectly, which it could have been since one of them fell off the map for 6 months and must have been taught a lot by the fucked up radical muslims.<br /><br />They still would have only said things in person to eachother and not browse the internet about bomb making, etc. <br /><br />They didn&#039;t seem the swiffest, but obviously I don&#039;t know. One of them posted radical videos of muslims, fell off the grid, had his parents deported, did not work and had more money than someone who had been on welfare for years should have, was on welfare for numerous years without a job and not a citizen yet, etc.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know all the details and I may be wrong on some, but it just seems to me that with the massive survalince that goes on there is litte way this guy could get away with what he did.<br /><br />I believe the goverment only works for themselves and not for there people, and that a domestic bombing that would put fear into the citizens about terrorisim would be a big gain for the goverment. They would be able to preach about what happened, we are not safe anymore on the streets, in are own houses, you have to put trust in us goverment to survey more to stop this from happening. <br /><br />I am also one that believes soon the goverment will be putting cameras in peoples houses and this newer generation will allow it as trust in the goverment now a days is very high. People believe, and are happy with the fact, that the goverments job is to wipe your ass for you and protect you from yourself. These ideas were more etched into peoples heads with a bombing like this, they are more likely to trust the goverment with freedoms they should not be trusting them with, in order to &quot;protect them&quot;<br /><br />I think that through the war on drugs and all the rest of this shit that we can agree that the goverment does not give a shit about there citizens, they only want to enslave them for their own benefit and fuck them over in a cage while they bring in massive profits. People say they hope and there is no way that the goverment is this sick, but has it not already been shown that they are? How much more will it take to show that they only give a shit about themselves?<br /><br />It makes me sick and I pray that it does not continue.

				No one in the government needs to go to such great lengths, or put themselves at great risk like that in order to gain the peoples trust. While most US citizens have little faith or trust in govt officials, they are still remarkably complacent and easily manipulated already. The people can be manipulated in a number of other ways, non violent ways, by elected officials and they are. <br />This whole 9/11 as an inside job and boston bombing conspiracy theory is just plain stupid. Yes government officials are corrupt, but they have way too much to lose by carrying out or planning or allowing attacks to happen to their own people. <br />The evidence against the boston marathon bombers is very solid, right down to the video footage of them planting the bombs and then walking away. And as much as I think LE gets a hard on for a good old fashioned manhunt, like the hired goons they are, they have nothing to gain by plotting this kind of thing. People should be careful when grouping together all govt officials and talking about the government like its one living breathing entity. Its comprised of many different people, who are all striving to get what they want to get done. Whether its good or bad, these are individuals we are talking about, individuals who make mistakes and are by no means perfect. I for one have little faith in the US govt at the moment, but this kind of talk is just plain ignorance. When I think of all the irresponsible things our govt does it makes me sick to my stomach as well, but have some faith in humanity if ya can, we are slowly but surely making progress IMO.

The foremost one is, all known evidence suggests that the towers have been knocked down by controlled demolition: towers crumbling together at almost free fall speed, molten steel on the ground being removed very fast instead of leaving it there for inspection. The crash of the airplanes was a mere spectacle for the gullible public. You will find more information on the net.<br /><br />The real conspiracy theory is the official version- that one Bin Laden and his Al Quaeda group did it. (and Bin Laden&#039;s death at sea was probably faked, as well)<br /><br />False flag operations have happened a few times in history, to justify war or stricter laws.<br /><br />And yes, J.F. Kennedy was killed for political reasons, maybe even Lady Diana.<br /><br />None of these incidents were even planned very carefully, nor did they even try very hard to cover up their footprints. They simply tell a lie over and over again till it&#039;s accepted by the general public as &quot;truth&quot; and history.<br /><br />EDIT: It&#039;s kind of easy to tell, why such an attack has been performed. <br />Just watch which political actions are taken during the months following the &quot;cataclysmic event&quot;.

Big secrets are protected by public incredulity.&quot;<br />-Marshall McLuhan, 1972<br /><br />&quot;All this was inspired by the principle— which is quite true in itself — that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously.&quot;<br />-Hitler, Mein Kampf

				probably going to get negative karma for this, but I feel like conspiracy theories are, in general, the result of humans coping with all the terrible things happening in the world.

The reasons why conspiracy theories like this are clearly false are both obvious and quite elementary, but you might be amazed at how hard it is for us (a.ka. you) to notice this.

				It comes down to people beleving what they are told and to go out and do the research themselves.<br /><br />When it came to 9/11 I didn&#039;t listen to the Bin Laden Al Quadea bullshit, I dug into the evidence myself, that is all there is to do. If the evidence supported the event being a terrorist attack from an outside source like Al Quadea, I would have agreed. It did not, anyone who was able to block out the general public and dig through the evidence would be able to see this and make thier own opinion.<br /><br />When it came to the Boston Bombings I did the same exact thing, I didn&#039;t think right when it happened that the goverment knew about it or that they did not, I looked through what was available and came up with my own opinion. Why and how did it take the LE 3 days to get video of the suspects? After the video came out their were numerous calls within minutes saying these are who the guys are, go get them. They never went after the suspects. It was not until the kids shot a cop. which at that point was thought to be unrelated to the police and they responded.<br /><br />I do not believe a thing I am told and I never will, nor will I ever be 100% sure of anything, ever. It was stupid for me to say &quot;HAD&quot; to know, there is no 100% in anything so I take that back. <br /><br />The only thing that is crazy is to listen to what the goverment says and believe any of their bullshit, we all know by know they lie a large majority of the time so it is up to us to come up with out own opinions.

Why and how did it take the LE 3 days to get video of the suspects? After the video came out their were numerous calls within minutes saying these are who the guys are, go get them. They never went after the suspects. It was not until the kids shot a cop. which at that point was thought to be unrelated to the police and they responded.<br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Really? You&#039;re confused as to why it took 3 days for law enforcement to get videos of the suspects? Combing through hours of footage from thousands of low-resolution cameras, having no idea what to look for specifically besides suspicious looking people carrying backpacks or suitcases? There were thousands of people standing and walking around the finish line of the marathon for hours. Once they spot their suspect(s) dozens of agencies need to communicate and deliberate with each other to make absolutely certain that the people they are suspecting are actually likely to be the real perpetrators. Law enforcement =/= The New York Post. Even before they released the suspect video, they were receiving hundreds of calls from people claiming to know or have information on who did it? How do you sift through the bullshit? It takes time.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really find conspiracy theories to be personally offensive. Not really. But I think it is offensive to criticize and belittle the law enforcement officers and government officials who worked tirelessly and put their lives on the line to catch those responsible for the bombing and prevent them from repeating it. <br /><br />We&#039;re all anti-LE here to a certain degree; you have to be to get involved with SR. But it&#039;s important to remember that so many of those LEOs save lives, protect the innocent and put the dangerous and violent behind bars. They still deserve our respect.

If they had the &#039;smoking gun&#039; I believe they would show it.&nbsp; How is watching a couple of guys place their backpacks on the ground distressing?&nbsp; What is more distressing is seeing people laying in pools of blood with legs missing, but that&#039;s all over the internet!<br /><br />For the most part I&#039;m with TMan99.&nbsp; There are a large number of inconsistencies to the official Boston narrative, and the story put out by the government has changed multiple times.&nbsp; While I don&#039;t claim to know what happened, and I&#039;m not offering any firm theories,&nbsp; I agree that what government officials say cannot be trusted.<br /><br />For me, the most ridiculous part of the Boston bombing story was when they put out the pictures of the suspects and asked the public for help identifying them!&nbsp; &nbsp;At the time this seemed reasonable but then we later learn that the brothers were already on the FBI&#039;s radar (and CIA I believe), and the Feds had visited their homes multiple times AND interviewed them!&nbsp; &nbsp;Are we expected to believe that when they identified surveillance pictures of their prime suspects, that the local FBI/CIA field office were not shown these before they were released to the media?&nbsp; Surely the local authorities and Feds would look at the pictures and somebody would&#039;ve said &quot;that&#039;s the Tsarnaev brothers. We&#039;ve got a file on them FOR SUSPECTED TERRORIST LINKS, so lets pick them up for questioning.&quot;&nbsp; Why did that not happen??&nbsp; It&#039;s inconceivable that this would be missed by multiple government agencies.&nbsp; If they knew who these guys were why would they put the photos out to the media causing the suspects to flee?&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps (as some have suggested) they were looking for an excuse to run a &#039;live city lock-down drill&#039;...<br /><br />Meanwhile, the brothers are hanging around in Boston, business as usual, not fleeing the scene of the crime, because presumably they don&#039;t realise they&#039;re suspects... until their photos are released.&nbsp; This then caused them to panic (whether innocent or guilty) and go on the run, and then the whole police state lockdown of Boston ensued.&nbsp; &nbsp;The extensive video footage of military style police in armored vehicles violently performing house to house searches is horrific to watch.&nbsp; <br /><br />If the brothers really were planning to hit NYC in a second bombing (as is widely reported by government officials via the mainstream media), would they not have skipped town in the immediate aftermath?&nbsp; &nbsp;For me there are far more questions than answers.

				p.s.&nbsp; At the very least, the government are out to capitalize on these attacks, and raise the specter of terror and fear, and they do this effectively via their manipulation of the mainstream media. I don&#039;t think anyone <br />would argue this point.&nbsp; After all, the Pentagon / Military Industrial complex need to make the most of events like these to help promote their phony &#039;War on Terror&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Worst case scenario, this was some kind of false flag attack.&nbsp; When I say this I&#039;m not saying &#039;the government did it&#039; as is often the accusation against anyone appearing to be a &#039;conspiracy theorist&#039;.&nbsp; To say &#039;the government&#039; did it implies, the whole government right up to the White House knew about this and planned it.&nbsp; I agree this is somewhat far-fetched.&nbsp; &nbsp;More likely, events such as this, if perpetrated by members of a US agency, would only involve a handful of people, and each person may only know their specific role, and not the wider plot. Of course this is speculation in the case of a specific case such as Boston, but military and intelligence specialists have gone on record saying that certain operations are run using this compartmentalized approach.<br /><br />My position is to question everything.&nbsp; Given the sheer number of lies we&#039;re fed by our governments (via the media), it would be insane not to!<br /><br />Right.... got side-tracked there.&nbsp; I came on to shop for psychedelics, not discuss the intricacies of the Boston bombing!&nbsp; x
