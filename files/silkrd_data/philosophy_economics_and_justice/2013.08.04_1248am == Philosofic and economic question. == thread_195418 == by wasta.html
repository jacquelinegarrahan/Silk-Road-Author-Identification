				I do not see a single question here. Neither Philosophic nor economic. Also before practicing philosophy or economics, study up on spelling and grammar.<br /><br />

But go to China for 9 days and see how much you can remember. Or from Morocco to Irak to learn Arabic. 9 days, and see how you do .<br /><br />I live on the continent of Europe , so I read Le Monde and Le Figaro and Der Spiegel. No National Geohorrific for my eyes.<br />English is a waste of time. I am going for Chinese. Translate 4 pages of English language into Chinese and you end up with just one page. Every word is just one or two caracters. I am not going to invest more time in English, this has to do.<br />Like Latin, That&#039;s the way where the English language will go. Even in the U.S.A. they will speak Spanish , very soon.<br />Duh!

				So rather than coming out here and ranting about it in broken English, why not set up shop and make a fortune?

The cost of doing all that means that you sell the 2c-b tab that cost you $1.10 to make for $10 or even $20.

				In finance we call the amount of money expected on return of a risky investment over the return of a risk-free investment, the risk premium. In drug dealing I use the same term, but give it a new definition. The risk premium is the amount of money you charge over and above the price if the item were legal. It costs money for people to risk their freedom.
