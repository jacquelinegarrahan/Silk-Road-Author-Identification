				Here is the official poll for Movie Night, which by the way will be taking place on Friday August 16th. <br /><br />There were so many nominations that I couldn&#039;t include them all, so if you don&#039;t see your nomination in here I&#039;m sorry, but I had to prune the list a bit. I wanted to keep it under 20, but I had to expand it to 25 choices just because there were so many great movies nominated! I tried to weed out the ones that were too incompatible or unrelated to the book clubs theme, and did lot&#039;s of research to make sure that I included every choice that had some good connection with the book club focus and libertarianism in one way or another. <br /><br />We will run this poll until Thursday, the day before Movie Night, and I am considering methods to narrow down the list further as voting goes along. If by Tues or Wed we see a clear top 5 favorites, or something like that, I will remove the rest and make a new poll to narrow down the favorite among those. If you guys have any suggestions for a better way to narrow the list down some, I&#039;m all ears. <br /><br />Anyway, please pick the movie you think would be best in line with our book clubs theme, and more importantly the movie that you think will foster the best discussions and debates about the ideals our book club was created to foster amongst the community. All in all, I think this experience has given us all a lot of movies to add to our &quot;must watch&quot; list! To all those who decided to watch a movie that they saw on this list or the nomination thread and thought it was worthy of discussion itself, I strongly urge you, in fact I beg you, PLEASE start a thread about that movie and encourage discussion about it.&nbsp; :)

				Great list! I&#039;ve seen most of these flicks and I don&#039;t remember disliking a single one. I voted for Waking Life. I feel that there are two categories of people in regards to this film:<br />1.)&nbsp; Those who have never seen it<br />2.)&nbsp; Those who have seen it and are completely fanatical about it.<br />I have yet to meet a single person that dislikes the movie.<br /><br />I think Waking Life should be the flick for Movie Night, those who have never seen it will enjoy the philosophical, existential, spiritual, and occasional political discussions that take place throughout the movie, not to mention the lucid dreaming aspect. I&#039;ve actually shown this movie to a group of five people under the influence of large amounts of LSD, and four of the five told me that watching the movie was life-changing. Obviously, this is very easy to say when psychedelics are involved, but I was told similar statements, such as, &quot;I had multiple epiphanies throughout the duration of the flick!&quot; from multiple other people whom I&#039;d introduced the film over the course of the years since the release. Richard Linklater is phenomenal in his animated films (some of his other projects, I don&#039;t much care for).<br /><br />But yes, Waking Life - the philosophical, existential, consciousness in general, political, and lucid dreaming themes throughout the movie, plus the wild animation from something like 30 different illustrators/animators(? Can&#039;t quite remember how many exactly...) will blow the minds of anyone new to the the movie. And for anyone who HAS seen it, I doubt they&#039;d be upset about watching it again - in fact, I try to watch it a few times a year myself! And most people who have seen the film are nuts about turning others onto the movie.<br /><br />That&#039;s my two cents (more like two paragraphs hardy har har)<br /><br />*Note: At the end of Waking Life, Linklater is in the movie, if memory serves, he is the fellow playing the pinball machine. There are many other cameos by miscellaneous actors, philosophers and existentialists, and a cameo from Mr. Alex Jones as well.<br /><br /><br />OH - Just an idea: Maybe there could be multiple films for movie night - multiple polls for movies with different themes! Like this:<br /><br />Philisophical/Existential Films:<br />Waking Life<br />Another Movie Here<br /><br />Spiritual/Existential Films:<br />I Heart Huckabees (Not on current poll, but check it out if you&#039;ve not seen it!)<br />Fierce Grace (The documentary about Ram Dass after his stroke. Not on current poll, but check it out if you&#039;ve not seen it!)<br /><br />Political Films:<br />For Liberty: How the Ron Paul Revolution Watered the Withered Tree of Liberty<br />America: Freedom to Fascism (Not on current poll, but check it out if you&#039;ve not seen it! Phenom doc.)<br /><br />Fight-the-System Films:<br />Fight Club<br />Zeitgeist<br /><br />Drug-Related Films:<br />City of God<br />Super High Me<br />Traffic<br /><br />Classics:<br />Brazil<br />Dr. Strangelove<br /><br />New(ish) Movies:<br />Atlas Shrugged II<br /><br />Just an idea :)

				what time (east coast U.S time) does movie night start, and how does it work? Do we all go to a separate site and watch the movie, while doing an instant message type chatroom thing? Also, my vote goes toward Waking Life as well. Scanner Darkly is also a very good movie, but IMO very depressing. If Waking Life wins, save your L for movie night hehe

				1984 fits the book club&#039;s topic perfectly but it would also show our support for men like Snowden and our stance on government transparency, the erosion of civil liberties, our right to privacy, and the terrifying amount of power and control now wielded by the government. I know I am not the only one far more terrified by my own government than by any extremist or jihadist. Assuming none of this power is being abused right now(Obtained only by massive oversight and eventual declassification of ALL NSA investigations being done along with no warrant-less surveillance) the day will come when we will regret sacrificing our rights in exchange for security, assuming of course that it isn&#039;t being abused now. &quot;Power is not a means: it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.&quot; <br /><br />A few people mentioned Fear and Loathing in the old thread so next time movie night rolls around I&#039;ll try and get Where the Buffalo Roam and The Rum Diary added to the list.<br /><br />[edited for bad spelling on the titles]

				I&#039;m actually surprised to see Brazil up there. It&#039;s one of my favorites (I pretty much like anything Gilliam does). So I&#039;m going to have to vote there.. I know it won&#039;t count for anything but what the heck. There are some truly great movies on this list. If anyone hasn&#039;t seen Brazil, and doesn&#039;t mind watching movies that mind-fuck you and make you go WTF? then give it a shot. It&#039;s really a great flick.
