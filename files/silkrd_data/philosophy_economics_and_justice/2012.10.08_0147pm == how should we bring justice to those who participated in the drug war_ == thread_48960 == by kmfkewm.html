				Some people think that we will win the war on drugs when drugs are legalized. But this does not sit well with me. Why is it a win when we are free to do what we should have never been restricted from doing in the first place? In the meantime, there will be people who made fortunes off of our oppression continuing to live happily. We will have people on our side who have spent decades of their lives in prisons for bullshit, they will have a government pension after retiring from fucking us over. Clearly it seems that even if drugs are legalized, we will not be winners, we will be more free but we will have lost enormous amounts while they will have gained enormous amounts by enslaving us. I believe that it stands to reason that if we accept that there could be a world where drugs are legalized, that we must then ask ourselves what to do to the people who oppressed us when drugs were illegal? If I take an innocent person off the street and throw them into a basement for a year, I am a pretty bad criminal right? Well if drugs are legalized, then if I take a drug user and put them in a basement for a year I am a pretty bad criminal for doing this right? Well what about the people who behave in this way while drugs are wrongfully illegal? Some justice must be brought to them, and I wonder how we can best go about this in a libertarian society.

				I personally would suggest mass executions of everyone in the DEA, jail time and heavy fines to non-drug-focused law enforcement will vary somewhat though. It just isn&#039;t feasible to kill everyone who has done anything related to drug law enforcement, but the ringleaders should be taken care of harshly. I really don&#039;t know the best way to hold them accountable for what they have done, but clearly just letting them live unbothered is not just.

				When has this logic ever applied to anything made legal in society?<br /><br />Slavery?

				Additionally, in a just society, the penalties they face would be equal to the penalties they would face if they engaged in these highly criminal activities without the benefit of being agents of the state. So the real question is, what should the sum penalty be for conspiracy, kidnapping and armed robbery? Obviously they must be held in cages for a very long amount of time if they are not to be killed, but who pays the bill for this imprisonment? I believe the cleanest solution is to simply execute them, certainly we should not be any more inconvenienced by them than we already have been?

				There isn&#039;t really a way to fight back proportionately without involving collateral damage. <br /><br />However if you shame them in the same way the Nazis were shamed after WWII, then you can return any discussion of a return to the Drug War a taboo subject. That&#039;s a kind of revenge.<br /><br />Morality aside, your idea is completely impractical. You were advocating mailbombs once. It doesn&#039;t make sense because if you start a violent assault you have to take it all the way. That doesn&#039;t mean killing DEA agents. It means you&#039;ll also be forced to kill anybody who steps in to defend them, you&#039;ll have to adopt a preemptive strike ideology.<br /><br />Put simply; the entire US government and a fair amount of the population would get dragged into such a mess if you began a violent campaign against the DEA. So it is Total War or nothing.<br /><br />I think you are overestimating the advantages of hard power over soft power. Our biggest ally is soft power, is good PR, is cultural influence. If you turn into Rambo, you throw all that away and you&#039;ll lose with close to 100% certainty, since the other government agencies aren&#039;t exactly going to stand by while you proceed.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are personally threatened with violence, then you have to respond in kind or you&#039;ll die. But that&#039;s a different situation to the one you&#039;re talking about, you&#039;re talking about an ideological war.<br /><br />For DEA agents to be shamed within their communities, to be castigated, to be despised until they die, that is enough. That is already beginning. Many conservative Christians hate what the DEA has turned into when they used to traditionally be stalwart supporters. At best many other parts of high society consider them a joke with bad taste. Otherwise we&#039;ll take an eye for an eye and leave the world blind.<br /><br />I realize this may seem feeble when you&#039;re sitting comfortable in a chair while former associates/friends are behind bars, missing their families and civilian life. But I&#039;m struggling to see a superior alternative. It seems better to me to put your energies into coming up with ways of spreading information that will enable the market to run rings around the DEA. To take it to the next level. There&#039;s dozens of useful projects, like PGP Club, like Jameslink&#039;s recent Pi idea, and so on, that productively can change things for the better. I mean they are fighting on our turf now, and they know it. It doesn&#039;t matter how many &quot;elite teams&quot; they dream up. They&#039;re completely outnumbered. This is a good place to fight the Drug War, even if you don&#039;t participate in taking any drugs yourself, many of SR&#039;s strongest supporters aren&#039;t necessarily even people who actively take illegal substances, but people who have simply had enough with this bullshit war and support the free choice of others.

				Whoa, just hold on a minute. Values change all the time in society, I don&#039;t think you can hold people responsible for doing what what was widely believed to be the &#039;right&#039; thing to do at that time and place. <br /><br />In 1660 in New England there were witch hunts and innocents died. <br />Previous to the 1970&#039;s in North America homosexuality was illegal (most states or provinces) <br />Currently there are people in prison for drug related offenses, but secret police didn&#039;t put them there, we all know the risk we take when we cross the line.<br /><br />Now-a-days Wicca is an acceptable belief/religion<br />People of the same sex can legally get married in many places<br />I believe it&#039;s only a matter of time until drug reform absolves those in prison<br /><br />Because you and I believe we are are more enlightened than the current status quo doesn&#039;t mean we should reign down righteous hell-fire when values come around to our way of thinking. Simply accept that times have changed and be thankful.

				I&#039;m with StExo and libertyseller - don&#039;t do anything to them.<br /><br />As a libertarian I would not oppose people seeking reparations, as long as it is only based on proven damage and individual liability. But personally, I would not pursue it, and I would urge forgiveness in others. After all, there&#039;s nothing worse we can do to them than what they would do to themselves. We will have won, beat &#039;em fair and square despite all their cheating.

				Right and wrong are subjective. Right now, society at large believe that drugs are bad. DEA is acting because they were told to by the government. The representatives in government are voted in by citizens like yourself (I&#039;m assuming here). So in the end, it&#039;s your responsibility to ensure that you educate people so as to vote in representatives that would accurately represent you.<br /><br />Also, how is the idea of mass DEA killings make you any better than any of the other petty dictatorships of the past? They killed scores of people for being complicit in things they deemed horrible or acting against what they thought was right. Killing people will do nothing other than ferment the fires of conflict.

Unless your life is directly threatened by them, dont kill em.

				In your &quot;libertarian&quot; society, you would have us prosecute former members of the DEA for carrying a different set of ideals than us, and fighting for that set of ideals. Although their actions may be misguided, I seriously doubt any of them actually think of what they are doing as oppressive. By doing something like that, not only would we be sinking to their level, we would take it further and torture/murder/publicly humiliate them.<br />Please understand that everyone has different concepts of right and wrong. What separates us from them is that we believe in non-aggression; as long as one&#039;s actions do not infringe upon the rights of others, they should be free to do whatever they want.<br /><br />Resentment is understandable, but the &quot;libertarian&quot; society you are envisioning really isn&#039;t a libertarian society. It would actually be the same thing we have now, just much more violent and oppressive, and we would be the tyrants. <br />Keep in mind that we are not terrorists or barbarians, we are revolutionaries :)<br /><br />-schmuck

The people who ran concentration camps in Nazi Germany enforced the law. Following orders has never been recognized as a valid excuse for committing crimes. This holds true for the Nazis who were tried with war crimes and it holds true for DEA agents. Following orders does not absolve them of responsibility. They choose to have the job they have. Nobody has forced them. Additionally, I do not recognize the laws of the state. You think as a statist if you think that there is any we involved with recognizing the law. I recognize right and wrong, not the law. If you think that following the law is all that matters then you must have been against the Nazis being tried for war crimes right? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I assume you&#039;re not a lazy ass and you have a job, pay taxes etc. Shall we try you for sponsoring terrorism?

For sponsoring terrorism, you&#039;re equally as guilty as those who commit it, so you should too be put to death.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Should someone who is extorted for money by the mafia be tried for sponsoring criminals?

The German society hated the Jews and their extermination was completely lawful. What about all of the other armies that have committed war crimes that were acceptable in the eyes of their societies? The list is enormous. Following your logic, people should not be held accountable for genocide if enough of their people supported the mass murder of innocents.

Yes, secret police have put hundreds of thousands of people in jail for drug crimes. What do you think undercover agents are?

				Seriously anyone who thinks that the DEA and other drug law enforcement agents don&#039;t deserve punishment is not really an anarchist or libertarian. You are not anarchists because you believe that acting as an agent of the state makes someone immune to being tried for state sanctioned crimes, and you are not a libertarian because you think that we do not have a right to punish people who have committed serious crimes against us simply because you see our own actions as criminal due to the state saying they are.

The difference is that the act of molesting a child infringes on other human&#039;s rights. Same thing as genocide, same thing as prosecuting drug users, and the same thing as exterminating anyone who has ever been a part of any law enforcement agency.<br /><br />I agree with you, the actions of the DEA are repugnant (to me), and their actions in a free society would be unacceptable. However, by wiping them out for their sins afterwards, you are judging a very large group of people, and you don&#039;t necessarily have the right to. If you were to do so, you would be setting a very dangerous precedent. Why don&#039;t we go wipe out all the muslims because of the 9/11 attacks? How about the entire African American population because they make up something like 40% of all welfare recipients?<br />It&#039;s the same reason why they don&#039;t have the&nbsp; right to judge drug users, and prosecute them based on their own beliefs.<br /><br />Honestly, the holocaust you are envisioning would be perfectly acceptable by history&#039;s standards. Revolutions are almost always followed by brutality against the oppressors, by the oppressed. But really, I don&#039;t see any progress in that, just years and years of pent up resentment being released. <br />Better to just let them go as a courtesy, a gesture of good faith. If the crimes are repeated, then go ahead and punish them as you will. I, for one will not object :)<br /><br />&quot;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind&quot;

				The issue is that however unjust, the DEA works within the confines of the law. One could say go and re-elect better politicians, change the laws, however a moral person would respect freedom of choice enough to refuse joining drug enforcement in the first place. I would like to see jail/prison time and loss of pension for drug warriors, giving them a taste of what they so readily wish on innocent people. With non-violent offenders not clogging up the correctional system there would be surplus money available for the returning of drug forfeitures to victims. <br />Returning to my first sentence though, it is more realistic that drug warriors would be simply be ostracized by their communities. By the time drugs, or at least pot are legal, so many people will have been victimized by the law that as they sit on their porch smoking a spliff and their ex-DEA neighbor drives by, they&#039;ll be thinking &quot;How could you have done that for a living?!&quot;

				For myself it is easy, <br /><br />1. Are the actions taken done with malice <br />2. Are the actions taken to support the current &quot;law&quot; and what many people believe to be right<br />3. Do the actions taken cause direct harm to another human<br />4. Do the actions taken have follow the non aggression principle <br /><br /><br />By using this very simple approach, child molesters are evil pricks and were I to catch one in the act I would execute them on the spot. It also means that if I witnessed a group of pigs or their federal hog buddies beating someone to death in front of me I would be morally obligated to act to defend that person. And before anyone gets on their high and mighty horse, I have acted in the past, and will again in the future if necessary. <br /><br />Those calling for the deaths of DEA officers, are individuals without any real experience in this. Killing is not easy, even if you could, why would you, other than that they wore a badge, what reason have you. Would you contract it to others? And if this is the case, than you are no better than they. A contracted murder is the same as what they do, contracted enforcement of laws we disagree with. <br /><br />Morality is more than emotional feelings. Use your heads if you have any ability to left.

There is an argument that can be made for malice being used to increase a criminals punishment, but the lack of malice is not an excuse for crime. Many people think that child molestation is right. Does that excuse those who commit the crime? Of course not. It doesn&#039;t matter how many people think something is right. Additionally, see my above reply for my thoughts on the law. As for three and four (the only points I agree with in regards to the assessment of criminality), drug enforcement agents are guilty of actions which fall under both (causing direct harm to innocents, not following the non-aggression principle). <br /><br /><br /><br />

The difference is that the act of molesting a child infringes on other human&#039;s rights. Same thing as genocide, same thing as prosecuting drug users, and the same thing as exterminating anyone who has ever been a part of any law enforcement agency.<br /><br />I agree with you, the actions of the DEA are repugnant (to me), and their actions in a free society would be unacceptable. However, by wiping them out for their sins afterwards, you are judging a very large group of people, and you don&#039;t necessarily have the right to. If you were to do so, you would be setting a very dangerous precedent. Why don&#039;t we go wipe out all the muslims because of the 9/11 attacks? How about the entire African American population because they make up something like 40% of all welfare recipients?<br />It&#039;s the same reason why they don&#039;t have the&nbsp; right to judge drug users, and prosecute them based on their own beliefs.<br /><br />Honestly, the holocaust you are envisioning would be perfectly acceptable by history&#039;s standards. Revolutions are almost always followed by brutality against the oppressors, by the oppressed. But really, I don&#039;t see any progress in that, just years and years of pent up resentment being released. <br />Better to just let them go as a courtesy, a gesture of good faith. If the crimes are repeated, then go ahead and punish them as you will. I, for one will not object :)<br /><br />&quot;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I&#039;m just leaving this here for reference because it seems like parts of my post were selectively modified or omitted....<br /><br />In the following post I use subjective terms such as &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;immoral.&quot; The use of these words is through my own sense of morality I have personally developed. I do not expect anyone to share these beliefs, and if they don&#039;t, I will not thing any less of them, much less prosecute/wipe them out for it.<br /><br />Maybe my argument has been unclear, but it is my belief that the evils of the DEA are not the evils of the individual. These people were not born violent, oppressive agents with the sole intent of prosecuting anyone who chose a different lifestyle choice than their own. Their actions and attitude have been the result of years of mental conditioning through fearmongering, anti-drug campaigns and sentiments, and constant exposure to propaganda. They themselves are not inherently immoral like the child molester you often like to compare everything to. The child molester makes a calm, often premeditated decision to violate a person&#039;s rights to their own body, fed by their own desire for gratification and control. And you are wrong about them thinking they are &quot;bad.&quot; I would be very surprised to find any child molester who believed that society was perfectly okay with what he was doing. That is what separates the DEA agent from the child molester. Morality is relative. Without the reinforcement or discouragement of those around us, there would be no such thing as a &quot;moral standard.&quot; The DEA agent, with all the lies that have been spoon-fed to him over the years, has no choice other than to believe that you (the drug user) are a genuine threat to society, and that you must be stopped.&nbsp; The real evil is the falsified, bigoted view society at large has on the drug using community. When this changes, I can guarantee you the only violent criminals left related to drug use will be you running around with your like minded mob, butchering former DEA agents. Or you could just not, under this society, the DEA and all related agencies would dissolve overnight, and anyone who continued their crimes after that would be prosecuted just like the common murderer, the common thief, or, like you said, the common child molester.<br /><br />By wiping them out, you are assuming the moral authority to judge a large group of people, something I don&#039;t feel like arguing again, as I already posted something on this in another thread:<br /><br />&quot;To the prophets spreading their truths to the rest of us,<br />Your perceptions are distorted by hatred and fanaticism.<br />You reject your government for it&#039;s intolerance and arbitrary judgement, yet your arguments are driven by the same sentiments.<br />Your mindset has been responsible for an extraordinary amount death and suffering over the course of history.<br />Not only do you refuse to accept any truths besides your own, you attempt to force these truths down the throats of a resisting population.<br />What is the source of your newly acquired divinity? Did your god come down to earth and speak with you? Did he appear in front of you in a vision and show you the way? Or have you been receiving otherworldly messages in your sleep?<br />Seriously, just leave everyone else the fuck alone.<br />Until people stop assuming the right to play god, there will be no real end to the violence and oppression.<br /><br />That goes for both kinds of zealots; LE and the self appointed crusaders for humanity who want to wipe them out.&quot;<br /><br /><br />History has told us that before you introduce violence and force, your problems seem to solve them in a much more simple, more elegant fashion.<br /><br />-schmuck

This is what happens in the most backwards places of the world. <br /><br />If everyone believed that it was &quot;us against them&quot; and condoned violence to achieve their goals, then what&#039;s to stop every dissatisfied wing-nut from going on a killing rampage. One of the things about living in a healthy democracy is that you can&#039;t always get your way BUT if you see a clear injustice you can always speak out against it, organize politically and fight for change. Although this takes effort and conviction, you have the opportunity and ability to do this without risking your life or others. Your welcome.&nbsp; We&#039;ve seen this peaceful method work over and over again and again.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying all is well with the current status quo, but I am saying that I don&#039;t know of a better system that allows average citizens to fight for what they believe in. I know this isn&#039;t as exciting as shouting &quot;Hang &#039;em high&quot; but get some perspective brother.

				&quot;Justice&quot; doesn&#039;t exist; it&#039;s revenge in a nice dress. No matter how deserved, if they are no longer a threat to others, you have no right to do anything but make them social outcasts. Which, I would most definitely do, for the same reasons I refuse to befriend or do business with any past or present public employee or receiver of redistribution benefits.

LE is a simple-minded blunt instrument. We control them, they do what we tell them to do. They don&#039;t&nbsp; need to be killed, anymore than the vacuum cleaner doesn&#039;t need to be shot to turn it off. You simply flip a switch.

I don&#039;t say this to be mean, I say it because it needs to be called out.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like LE what or who do you propose take over the job of keeping order?

				I think your getting ahead of yourself, i think we need to concentrate on ending the war before we decide what to do with the other side. <br />Given the current stance from the governments in the western world this goal is a long way off and realistically has no end, like other bullshit wars being fought there really will be no winner, just arms dealers with big fat sky rockets thinking up more and more ingenious ways to kill as many people as possible with minimum effort, for them there&#039;s no profit in peace.<br /><br /><br />

Not in all the states, but a lot of them. Look to see if there&#039;s dispensary near you. My country followed your country&#039;s lead! Nobody voted for this to happen, but social attitudes change over time and governments of western democracies usually recognize this. <br /><br />In British Columbia possession of weed for personal use is not a criminal offense for anyone, regardless of a person&#039;s medical condition. I think you may get a ticket. Not sure.<br />In my own city there are clubs you can go where, if you bring your own stuff, you can put it in a vaporizer and watch stand-up comedy (The VaporRoom Anybody?? - talk about fun, laughed so hard my cheeks hurt) LE could care less.<br /><br />I suppose if went up to a cop and blew my weed smoke in his face he may arrest me for public disorder (along the same lines as &#039;drunk and disorderly&#039;) But I wouldn&#039;t do any real jail time.<br /><br />The point is in the past drugs frightened people and we all know fear is a good motivator to persecute. These days I don&#039;t know anyone who hasn&#039;t smoked a spliff at least once at some time. We&#039;re better educated about the facts. The last 3 President of the US all admit to having tried various drugs (although I think one of them said he didn&#039;t inhale&nbsp; ;D) <br /><br />This is just the start brother. I work in agriculture and a lot of growers of &quot;legitimate&quot; crops have contingency plans for experimental marijuana cultivation if/when it becomes possible to grow and sell on an open market. These aren&#039;t shady GrowOps, but legitimate businessmen who don&#039;t view it as a &#039;sin&#039;. South American governments are openly talking legalizing even harder drugs like cocaine and opiates because they know it&#039;s an un-winnable battle. <br /><br />I see the war on drugs ending or grinding down with no help from revolutionaries who take up violence. If anything, we users should now step up to the plate and show that we can be decent dependable citizens, not half-cocked Rambos looking for punishment and death.&nbsp;

We will have people on our side who have spent decades of their lives in prisons for bullshit, they will have a government pension after retiring from fucking us over.

If I take an innocent person off the street and throw them into a basement for a year, I am a pretty bad criminal right? Well if drugs are legalized, then if I take a drug user and put them in a basement for a year I am a pretty bad criminal for doing this right?

				+ 1 to Stoned Emo for actually doing some research before posting, even though your quote was only partial - I&#039;ll include the rest the best parts in CAPS:<br /><br /><br />&quot; ... A particularly contentious aspect of the bill was the proposed enhancement of powers given to government authorities to monitor online communications, BUT THIS PROPOSAL WAS ABANDONED AFTER AN ONLINE PETITION OPPOSING THOSE MEASURES GARNERED OVER 70,000 SIGNATURES<br />&nbsp;<br />The bill is causing much controversy. While the Canadian Police Association said the bill would work towards keeping communities more safe, it added it was concerned about the cost.[5] THE QUEBEC GOVERNMENT SAID IT WOULD REFUSE TO PAY FOR THE BILL, CALLING IT A SHORT-TERM BAND-AID SOLUTION. THE ONTARIO GOVERNMENT WOULD ALSO REFUSE TOP PAY.&nbsp; Texan conservatives Judge John Creuzot, Republican Representative Jerry Madden, and Marc Levin also spoke out against the bill; according to Madden, &quot;It&#039;s a very expensive thing to build new prisons and, if you build them, I guarantee you they will come. They&#039;ll be filled, OK? Because people will send them there.&quot;[7]<br /><br /><br />- 1 to Stoned Emo for attributing my quote to Mr. Nicolson.

				NewsThump.com is a spoof site. Kind of along the lines of The onion - go ahead google it.<br /><br />That article that StonedEmo sited is actually really funny, check this quote:<br /><br />&quot;... She said, “You only have to watch the opening credits of Grange Hill to see the kind of terrifying hallucinations that some drugs can induce,” she claimed.<br />“One second they are sat having what they think is a great time, they next they are being attacked by a flying sausage.”<br />“It may start off with marijuana, but all the evidence that I’ve made up suggests it will inevitably lead to other things like sniffing crack.”...&quot; <br /><br />...&nbsp; flying sausage attack and &quot;sniffing crack&quot; WTF ?! ?<br />Grange Hill was a TV show in the UK.&nbsp; Don&#039;t worry Emo - I don&#039;t think the people of the UK would take any of that shite seriously (unlike you, and you call ME retarded!). Unless they smoked a joint and actually were attacked by a flying sausage. Not sure how often that happens in the UK though so ..&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The other huffingtonpost post article refers to Romney&#039;s opposition to pot. Gee I&#039;m shocked - A republican nominee who has to court his socially conservative support base.&nbsp; ::) .<br /><br />I&#039;ll go on record here and say that in the next few years (5- 10) you&#039;ll probably see a lot of loosening up on soft drug laws all over the world.<br />

				Ahh, I love this thread, if only because it lets me see into the minds of people I don&#039;t agree with. <br /><br />I gotta ask some of you though, how did you get so jaded and violence oriented? I guess I could understand if you did time in a penitentiary based on bogus drug charges, or have family that has. Although I&#039;m not American, I understand that there are a disproportionate number of US citizens in jail for drug related offenses. That would piss me off too, but to wish death on people ... <br /><br />I just don&#039;t understand why death sentences would be acceptable as punishment. I&#039;ve lived in places where life is cheap, I&#039;ve known people to be put to death because they were on the wrong side of a political argument. Believe me when I say that these are not places you want to live. You have to be a simple-minded person without an opinion of any kind to live there, otherwise your life may be at some kind of risk, whether it&#039;s legally sanctioned or not.<br /><br />I dunno, it just seems like when people start talking about justice and death, they have no real idea about the words that they speak, there doesn&#039;t seem to be a true understanding of any lessons learned in our collective human experience. Either that or it just sounds cool and glamorous to get stoned and shout out about death. I honestly don&#039;t know what the difference is in some peoples minds.

				Do you enlightened pacifists think that a man who rapes and murders a three year old should be given a death sentence? Or does your same outlook of pacifism and forgiveness also apply to him? Do you think he deserves any punishment at all, perhaps a life sentence if not death? The reason I can feel fine in calling for death of DEA agents is because I recognize that they are violent career criminals. They are guilty of millions of kidnappings, many thousand homicides, millions of armed robberies, home invasions, terrorism and more. Such people must be brought to justice , just as a man who rapes and murders a child must be. Death is a fitting punishment for their crimes, but even if we are so pacifistic as to think no man is worthy of being killed, we must at least keep these wild beasts in cages until the day they die of natural causes. To think otherwise means one of two things; either you would not wish justice upon anyone who commits murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, home invasion and terrorism OR you excuse the behavior or those who commit these crimes so long as they are acting in the name of the state. I imagine that the second option holds true for you, and thus you are statists and indeed are enemies to Anarchy. I wonder why would a statist come and obtain the services of an anarchist enterprise?

Just curious) That&#039;s a lot of labels to throw around. <br />I don&#039;t really consider myself a pacifist simply because I don&#039;t agree with the death penalty. I don&#039;t know what a statist is (but if you want to offer a definition I might just be), and I&#039;m certainly not an anarchist as I do believe in some kind state structure. <br /><br />Personally I kind of flip-flop on the death penalty. Those rapists of 3 yr olds you talk about - yeah, if anyone is a candidate for the ultimate punishment it&#039;s those guys, but only because there really is no cure for that kind of sexual deviancy. Those guys are just born evil. I don&#039;t see how you can seriously compare a child rapist to a DEA agent though. It seems a bit of a stretch and quite extreme.<br /><br />Your point about statists (I assume statists are non-anarchists?? ) coming here to SR for drugs is interesting. Your right, I couldn&#039;t go to a government sponsored drug emporium and pick my poison (although state sanctioned marijuana dispensaries do exist for medical reasons, sadly I don&#039;t qualify&nbsp; :&#039;( ) But here&#039;s the thing - I don&#039;t completely agree with everything that any one person, government or idea has to say. There is no such thing as perfection. I would go through life hating almost everything for it&#039;s faults if I believed that somewhere, just around the next corner maybe, was a perfect system that I could 100% agree with. The idea of &quot;Government&quot; is at best just a means to help us organize for the betterment of all - roads, schools, hospitals and infrastructure. At worst it&#039;s a method of suppressive control by a few people over many and I can understand your anger at big government organization that seems to know no bounds. <br /><br />Simply put, no one owns me. I participate in the system not because I blindly agree with everything my government does, but because if I don&#039;t they will get away with whatever they can take. It&#039;s far from perfect (very very far) and you can poke a zillion holes in it, but I just don&#039;t know of any other method of order that allows for the voice of &#039;Joe Average&#039; to be heard. Do you?

				Pretty interesting and actually scary vision of revolution. First we get DEA and other goverment &#039;opressors&#039; then who? Anyone who disagrees with us doing drugs? Your parents, priests?<br />As Nietzsche wrote: &#039;He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you.&#039;<br /><br />History is full of examples how revolutions like that end, how oppressed become oppressors. <br />Yet there were couple of notable examples which tried not to allow for it. Like english 1495 treason act, which was made to protect people who fought on the loosing side but according to the law(in short and not really true). Or Chinese revolutions 1911 and later where emperor wasn&#039;t killed but allowed to live with common folk(both didn&#039;t end well) where one of the revolutionists said to Europeans &#039;not every revolution has to be bathed in blood&#039;. And we should rather look up to these people than to Robespierre.<br />And as far as I know in most western countries you can&#039;t punish someone after the law changes for something that he did according to the earlier law(unless it is genocide or homicide).<br /><br />I&#039;m from post communistic country, where more than half of population belonged to a party, worked as secret police or worked with secret police. Most of them did so just to get along without problems or fear, some of them because they actually believed in the system. And here comes 90s when communism goes down the shitter and we have to do something with all these people who helped to oppress others. There were couple of ways to do it(Germany and Czech Republic did it pretty well) my country chose the worst way(mostly due to heads of opposition being secret service themselves) so now the people who were in power are still in power and in the end not even people who gave orders to shoot at protestors were held responsible. Yet the question was/is who, how and why should we punish for oppression when more than half of the people in the country were responsible for it.<br />I&#039;d think to get the heads of it and the most vicious of their pawns giving the rest opportunity to redeem themselves instead of going on a killing spree.<br /><br />Anyways funny thing is that someone here claims that SR is being anarchist, with escrow, moderation, ratings etc. it is far from being an anarchy. Most organized crime(as in going against the law not morally/philosophically crime) is far from being an anarchy.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">only the individual is natural!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Actually humans are social animals, and are prone to create groups, so individuals are not natural. <br />I&#039;d even go to the extremes and say that individualism is responsible for crimes against humanity, because an individual doesn&#039;t feel connection with other humans thus he can easily manipulate them, kill them etc. without guilt.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Freedom cannot exist partially, it either is or it is not. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Your freedom ends where my freedom begins.

All we can ask for from any form of government is that our voices are HEARD, not agreed with and obeyed unequivocally. I don&#039;t think any healthy society should give all the decision-making over to one guy or even one group of guys.<br /><br />More to your 4th question though - How is my voice heard - First I talk to my local political reps and let them know what&#039;s important to me. I can also organize my own special interest group and lobby city hall, or any level of gov. for my requests. I can start my own publications and distribute them wherever, and to whomever wants to read them. Ultimately I could run for office if I was so motivated (yes, I become a politician but it&#039;s better than simply killing guys you don&#039;t like lest they decide they don&#039;t like you and then we all kill each other). All of these avenues are open to anyone. <br /><br />Taxes are a bitch, but how else are roads gonna get built?<br /><br />I disagree with your last statement about freedom being an &quot;all or nothing&quot; thing. As Spiderman knows - with freedom comes responsibility. If my neighbor decides he wants to drive his car on the opposite side of the road, he might cause a lot of damage. We have to tell him that he is not free to do this and that he must submit to laws requiring cars to operate in unison. <br /><br />So, there&#039;s me defending some semblance of government. <br />What&#039;s your idea of a better societal system?

I get it bro. That kind of logic is sound.<br /><br />BUT - in the meantime, who&#039;s gonna build a practical transportation system of roads and infrastructure? Who will setup reliable schools nationwide? For God&#039;s sake man - who will subsidize my electrical bill ??!!<br />A series of loose knit entrepreneurs who believe in nothing other than making a profit - OR - some kind or elected representative from my neighborhood ( HINT - you get a say in what happens with one of those choices.) <br /><br />Now don&#039;t get me wrong - I&#039;m not for everything being government run, in my mind the ONLY things government should be involved in are roads, education, hospitals, a judiciary and a BASIC welfare safely net so that those of us who don&#039;t succeed will not starve.<br />In other words - only things that work for the clear benefit of us all, everything else should be left to private industry to sort out.<br /><br />In my world, we&#039;re not afraid of our government because we control it; we keep it in check constantly by participating in the communities where we live, making sure that our opinions are expressed by the freedoms we are guaranteed, and we really are guaranteed them! Publish any opinion you want in any media outlet and you will never get arrested for it (as long as your not preaching hate, death and destruction Duhh !!) <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Community involvement is good- federal government is bad. In the usa private contractors build the roads paid by public funds that have been greatly inflated/ this means that they take an average of 20,000 from each working adult in the usa annually (more or less including all types of taxation) <br /><br />if a small community wanted a road or three or four and paid 20,000 apiece (size of community has 12,000 working adults) that seems a bit much- get the point? <br /><br />Besides in the usa the infrastructure is collapsing, shit we have worse communications than iraq does after 8 years of war. <br /><br />Who will build the roads, get a damn shovel . Go back to trains (they worked well) ;)

Some site members (kmfkewm im speakin&#039; to you bro) believe that these LE agents shouldn&#039;t just be fired - they should be tried and executed as criminals themselves. But the thing is that what they are doing is totally legal within the definitions we allow ourselves right now. We could split hairs on how a constitution is interpreted but whatever the outcome of that debate, a case could be made for justifying what is happening. <br /><br />It&#039;s up to us, people on the vanguard of social enlightenment to convince the rest of society that drug usage is NOT criminal and should not be interpreted as a punishable offense. We can do this inside of the current system, there is room for flexibility regardless of what you think of Obama or Romney (a side show of epic proportions). Politicians are our puppets. Just promise them a million votes and they will do and say whatever you what them to. The trick is getting that million votes. If you are under the age of 30 politicians don&#039;t give a shit about you. You know why - because you don&#039;t vote. If you&#039;re over 65 politicians will cater to your every concern and fear because you ALL vote. Don&#039;t even think of touching medicare or social security. If politicians saw the value in voters under the age of 30 you can bet your sweet ass we&#039;d be smokin&#039; pot in designated clubs and dispensaries would open up to the public.<br /><br />My point is that our politicians are a reflection of us, more specifically, of who vote and demand to be heard.

				I also agree. I used to be someone who was so angry I thought about something similar. Here&#039;s the thing. Not only are you outgunned, but you are no doubt on their radar now. They have Billions of dollars at their disposal and you have probably very little. Also, you would only be stooping to their level by demanding that you are right in murdering said people. They are wrong to abuse us addicts, as such they do from time to time. But rounding them up and killing them is not the answer. For one, they are people too, and people make mistakes. And for another thing, that is no sort of solution. The whole reason we are angry at the agency, those of us who are, is because they are responsible for so much death with their failed policies and abuse of power. More death is never the answer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I like other people&#039;s responses. I think it is especially important that we stay organized and educated, and dont stoop to their level. We are people, not goons, and dont let the mistreatment kill you. Just wait twenty years until they are no longer in existence, hopefully, or get organized and do something to put a stop to their behavior. That is your best option. A holocaust is foolish and you no doubt have not thought that through. -Thedopestjunkie

				Lots of statists in this thread. &quot;It is okay to punish kidnappers, armed robbers and murderers, but if they have acted in the name of the state it is wrong to punish them and our duty to convince them that we are good people and do not deserve to be kidnapped, robbed and murdered. In the mean time we must allow them to abuse us because they are just people looking to provide for their families!&quot;<br /><br />you all make me sick to my stomach and it is glaringly obvious that none of you law enforcement apologists have actually felt the consequences of the war on drugs in any more than an abstract sense. Maybe when you have friends doing life sentences over drugs, or have done some hard years in prison yourself, you will stop looking for every opportunity to suck off a cop that you can find. They are the ones who have treated human life as something that is worthless, they are the ones who must now experience the repercussions of that. Having a badge is not an excuse for violent crime. Period. There is not an excuse for what they do. It is injustice to not punish them. Really to think otherwise is just proof of your statist indoctrination.

				Please forgive me for just skimming trough the thread, here is my opinion:<br /><br />Lining the whole DEA up and blow their brains out doesnt seem like a good idea to me, even though emotionally I would love to just as much as you kmfkewm. <br /><br />Studies have show that showing forgiveness instead of endless punishment works out better in the long term. This has been show by all the repayment Germany had to make after WW1 which led to WW2. Now we have Greece which has its citizens extorted to pay for the debts of previous governments there which will lead to WW3 most likely. <br /><br />If we will punish all of those now involved in the war of drugs to paying reparations, jail or death, no matter how much they deserve it, we will never stop fighting with them. Ayways, the question was of how we should bring them to justice, and I only have said (typed) just now how we shouldnt do it. In my opinion we should do only something symbolic. Thumbprint the head of the DEA live on TV by force, not allow him/her to buy alcohol/smokes for a month and then ask how it feels etc.<br /><br />How the fuck would we accomplish this though? I think that to make the war on drugs stop we first need to focus on taking the religious aspect out of governments in order to enable them to have a more pragmatic view of things instead of doing things because some rich lobbyist group who have a imaginary friend wants them to do it.

				I already answered your questions. Everything will be privatized. The court that tries the DEA agents and the agency that enforces the sentences against them will be privately funded and volunteered by people who they have wronged. The roads will be managed by private companies. Everything will be private, including the defense agencies. There would not even be a drug war if it were not for government. Do you think that the average person will voluntarily donate money towards fighting the war on drugs? Of course not, because it really doesn&#039;t matter to Joe Blow if his neighbor smokes pot or sniffs coke, so long as his neighbor does not hurt him. He will care more about funding people to protect him from theft than he will care to fund an agency that hunts down people and confiscates their drugs and locks them up. The only way the drug enforcement agencies can exist is via one stealing profits from drug dealers and two being funded by tax dollars. Cut off the tax dollars and then they are private agencies that need to sustain themselves on stealing valuables from drug dealers. Thus they are an organized gang that specializes in armed robbery, kidnappings and similar. To protect from this band of criminals us drug users will need to fund private defense agencies. As I already pointed out, silk road is an example of such a defense agency. It uses a purely defensive methodology in order to enable us in obtaining drugs whilst avoiding the armed criminal gangs. In the future, I hope for there to be more sophisticated agencies that not only protect us as SR does but also brings the armed criminal gang members to justice on an individual level. Break into someones home and arrest them for a drug charge? Wow, hopefully you avoid the Drug User Protection Agency which is paid to hunt you down and put a bullet between your eyes. Perhaps you will only get some prison time, but the point is you become a target for acting as a criminal. If I go to prison for a drug crime, I will be happy when the drug user protection agency executes those directly responsible as well as busts me out of prison :). I will not be saying &quot;Dear police you really goofed up and should let me out because I love you and know you are just confused about things, because really I am a nice person and good citizen I swear!&quot;.

				Who is going to attack to average Joe? Average people will organize together to protect themselves. Why would you not protect your neighbor in return for him protecting&nbsp; you? Why would you not both pool your money towards a shared neighborhood defense fund and hire a security agency to protect you? There already is tribe warfare, don&#039;t you know about the crips and the bloods and the CIA and the FSB and the police and the Zetas? There is tribe warfare going on already, and for the most part the average citizen is left out of it. Where they are not left out is in their forced funding of some organizations such as the DEA and local police. They have no choice but to pay these extortionists. Of course the Mafia in particular and many other tribes will also participate in protection rackets, but not to the extent done by the government gangs. The government already has people indoctrinated into thinking they should give them money, and they have a huge and sophisticated collections agency. So in your world there is tribe warfare, and the majority of people pick the rules of operation for the well established police tribes, in return for funding them (which is actually EXTORTED from them). Make that funding voluntary and you will find the DEA has a big gaping hole in funding where peoples extorted tax dollars used to be. Most people just do not give a shit&nbsp; enough about drugs that they would voluntarily fund the DEA, even if they are against drugs they are not going to be so eager to separate with their money if they are not forced to. The DEA will then fund itself by robbing drug dealers, as they already do but it will become even more important if people are not forced to fund them via taxes. But these drug dealers are making money selling drugs as well, and it is in their best interests to hire a protection agency. This protection agency is NOT concerned with what the average person does, but it is concerned with treating DEA agents as kidnappers and robbers. A war between these tribes must happen, and already it is happening but you take the perspective of the government agencies NOT being warring tribes but rather enforcers of laws and that is where you are making your mistake. You also put far too much confidence in the concept of democracy, democracy does not work in a world where large majorities of people are susceptible to brainwashing in various degrees.

				We must treat the drug enforcement of today as we will treat the kidnappers of drug users in the years when drugs are legalized, to do otherwise is to claim that following orders and enforcing unjust laws is excusable and that law and orders trumps what is morally right. Law will never dictate morality, and people should be held to account for what is just not what is legal or illegal. Saying that following the law excuses DEA agents of kidnapping is analogous to saying that the Nazi war criminals should have been excused on account of just following orders. War crimes courts have already established that this is not a legitimate excuse, and it is rather scary that some people seem to want to imply that it is.

If you want defense from being robbed it will be in your best interests to purchase this service from a private company that can offer it. If you do not want &quot;defense&quot; from drug users smoking marijuana, then you will not pay for this from the security agency or obtain services from such a security agency. In the society of today, you must get security from a selection of approved agencies. They protect you in a uniform fashion, and you fund all of this. If you don&#039;t support the war in the Middle East it doesn&#039;t matter you are still going to fund it (ie: you are funding the agencies that are fighting a war there). This is the exact opposite of voluntaryism and it is the exact opposite of a free market. Of course we have atrocities like the war on drugs, we are forced to fund it! That money goes somewhere, it goes into the paychecks of the DEA agents and it makes the private owners of prisons very rich. There doesn&#039;t need to be a reason for the war on drugs other than the fact that it makes them rich, and the propaganda makes it seem like what they do is okay and for a good cause so they will take that paycheck. In a free world you would not be forced to pay for your own oppression and you are free to pay for your own defense from what you see as oppression. How could anyone not want that? <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Sounds like the significant portion of your income you save in taxes would now go towards paying these &quot;security agencies&quot; to defend your neighborhood. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes some amount of the money you save from not being forced to pay a wide variety of government security and &quot;security&quot; agencies would need to be spent on private security agencies to replace them, provided you want to have the same level of security. Of course when you stop funding agencies that bust drug users and agencies that forcibly extort money from you, the total cost of defense will automatically be cheaper. Additionally private services are very frequently proven as being more efficient and effective than government provided services, just look at the difference in education provided by a privates schools versus public schools. And private schools would be more affordable for people if they were not forced into funding a public school system. And for people who still couldn&#039;t afford private schooling, there will be plenty of public school opportunities offered by various religious charities and especially internet classrooms. Likewise, private defense agencies will be more efficient and more effective than government run defense agencies. So in addition to saving money, you can put the money you saved towards more effectively and efficiently protecting yourself at a lower price!&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And there would be nothing preventing the private security agency you hire from being abusive, corrupt, or incompetent on levels much more intolerable than your current government.

But I recognize that there are trade offs in a representative democracy since not everyone is going to agree with me hence my tax dollars aren’t always going to be spent on things I agree with. You don’t seem to recognize that in your “free world” you’re going to inevitably run into the same issues. There would still exist a state, be it on a much smaller scale like your neighborhood. There would still be public goods in your neighborhood-state, like common defense, where you’ll disagree with your neighbor on how much needs to be spent and what it should be spent on. If he doesn’t agree with your budget idea and “opts out” on principle of voluntaryism what are you going to do? Force him to pay for something he doesn’t want, but will get as a residual benefit anyway because the rest of you will? But then you’d be doing precisely what you decry the government is doing.<br /><br />Within the system, I have no reason not to believe that once a critical mass of the populace comes to recognize the futility of the WoD that the laws will change ... as they did for prohibition. And again, saying your belief you’re being forced to pay for it in contravention of a free market is just not true. You can move to a country that doesn’t spend tax dollars on wars in the Middle East or has decriminalized drug use.

I’m also surprised to see your use of private vs public education as proof of private sector superiority when that canard was debunked six years ago in a landmark study that found no appreciable differences.

The history of private states (monarchies,feudalism,despotism,oligarchies) and private law (slavery,mafias,warlordism,fiefdoms) shows you what your “free market” would look like in the absence a jointly owned, strong, and centralized state. No reason for private security agencies to compete for your business when they can just collude with the others on where to divide up their territorial monopolies, and then FORCE you to use their business. If they can’t agree they’ll go to war over who gets to enslave you. But to think they’re going to get into a nice and orderly “free market” price war to compete for the chance to sell you their protection services? Pfffft ... dude. <br /><br />That only happens now because there’s a government backed legal framework that deters them from forcing their services on you.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The worst case scenario you predict is exactly what we have right now, you are forced to provide funding to colluding government agencies via their mafiaesque defense rackets.

I find your idealistic blind faith here so over the top for a minute there I thought you were clowning me. In several thousand years of recorded history there has never once been an even temporarily successful libertarian anarchy.&nbsp; Yet here you are not only saying it’s possible in spite of a total lack of evidence,&nbsp; but that only in the “worst case scenario” or IOW, the libertarian anarchic dystopian nightmare, things would look no different than what we have now. Seriously dude? I kind of hope you were high when you said.<br /><br />What we have now is not mob rule and to suggest that it is is just ludicrous. The essence of mob rule is arbitrary and unchecked force in complete disregard of individual rights. Our form of government, however imperfect, was designed to protect individual liberty from mob rule. We have access to levers of government to demand accountability as a check on abuses of power. Wackmanblu has already covered a lot of how to do this but you speak like we live in a totalitarian state when we don’t. So when you say there’s “very little” that prevents government from arbitrarily raising taxes I’m sorry but that’s just ignorant. There are a confluence of democratic forces that prevent a tax hike that starts with WE THE PUBLIC DON’T WANT TO BE FUCKING TAXED MORE. It’s why the highest income tax rates have dropped from a peak of 92% in 1953 (which sounds a lot closer to your “worst case scenario” of “enormous protection fees”) to the 35% it is right now. Politicians know that tax hikes are anathema to getting and staying elected and raising them comes at great political cost and is not a decision made lightly. There’s also got to be consensus passed among a majority of our elected reps in two houses of congress where it’s debated there and the public sphere before it can even be signed into law by the prez so to say that “very little” stops them from raising taxes is just ignorant to how our democratic system of government works. Laws were made hard to pass for a reason and that’s to protect against mob rule. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why do you not call the people using their public militias to wreack havoc warlords?

There’s a difference between private and public remember? But with no legal framework backed by the force of government the CEO of a private security agency might as well be a warlord because there are no commercial laws to govern him. The DEA is not a band of gun waving robbers. They are an agency of government that is controlled by we the people. It continues to exist because the majority condones and sees value in its existence even if you or I do not ... and their ability to coerce is still regulated by our laws. A band of home invading robbers and kidnappers are not controlled by anyone but are instead laws onto themselves.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> You have been totally conditioned to the point that you see the governments behavior through a distortion, but when you remove the title government you see any organized defense as necessarily being what the government already is and without the distortion! </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what our government is and how it works. If we lived in a totalitarian state governed essentially by mob rule I could see your point, that a law enforcement agency that kicks in your door and takes your drugs and throws you in jail are nothing more than paramilitary thugs and thieves.&nbsp; But we don’t. We live in a representative democracy of a constitutional republic and are therefore responsible for governing ourselves. Government behavior (guided by the laws on the books) is a reflection of our values as a society. They might be a distortion because as our societal attitudes evolve it takes a while for the laws to catch up. It’s in this respect that I believe the DEA an antiquated agency and it’s just a matter of time before the majority recognizes its uselessness since we come armed with the facts and empirical evidence on our side.<br />But for you to advocate that when that day does come that DEA should just be lined up and shot is just insane. You sound like a wild eyed Marxist guerilla during the time of Pol Pot who went on to massacre 2.5 million bourgeois because they just HAD to know they were exploiting the landless proletariat through wage slavery and if they didn’t, well they needed to be made an example of anyway so future generations would know that ignorance was no excuse. So explain to me the difference between you and Pol Pot again?

I am forced to select one thus I am not in a free market where I could select none. And within the nations there is not a free market or even the option to select from various agencies, there is a single monopoly protected by the federal government, and all of us are forced to fund these agencies and receive even &quot;protections&quot; that we do not desire.

Look at things like reefer madness ,&nbsp; do you think the people who made that propaganda thought that it was honest truth? No, people who make propaganda at the highest levels understand that it is false and lies. The government lied to the people to justify imprisoning and enslaving millions of its own citizens for the profit of private interests. They have literally sold us into prison industrial slavery, and no our neighbors did not decide to do this on their own, they were conditioned into it by a group of powerful elites who would profit from our slavery. Democracy is a flawed system, the masses are too easily manipulated for it to be meaningful in the slightest. We will what end the war on drugs when people wake up from decades or centuries of propaganda and lies? And this is your victory of democracy?!

				That would mean something to me if you didn&#039;t say it on a forum that is dedicated to drug trafficking. The ostensible majority do not wish for silk road to exist,&nbsp; and it is illegal in every nation on earth, and yet you say to me over this channel that libertarian anarchy will not come to be because it is against the wishes of the majority. The free market provides this service to drug users despite the best efforts of the federal law enforcement agencies of the world. It seems to me like the people full of hot air are the statists, because they are powerless to stop the free market. Never forget that a thousand who are known can be overcome by one who is not. SR and the online drug scene are enough to show that the many who wish to oppress the few will not always succeed in doing so. Of course this implies that the many actually rationally wish to oppress the (many subsections of...) few and have not just brainwashed.&nbsp; Personally, I think&nbsp; that they (the masses) are just brainwashed though. It&#039;s just that I find it hard to imagine that so many people could be so evil, but so easy to imagine that most people are just easily frightened and stupid. I don&#039;t really blame the majority for the war on drugs, honestly I would forgive them, but I will never forgive the architects of the war on drugs, those who enforced the drug laws, or those who gained the most from our oppression, and indeed I hope that they are made to suffer for the needless suffering they have caused to so many, at least when they suffer some justice will have been done.&nbsp;

				one member of the ILF here, these views do not necessarily reflect those of all the ILF ... but ...<br /><br />this thread is fascinating.&nbsp; it&#039;s bringing up much more than actually is being stated, most importantly, it seems to me, the topic of whether or not killing falls under moral absolutism.&nbsp; if it is absolutely wrong, then it is wrong all the time, even when the person you are killing is a murderer/kidnapper/thief.&nbsp; but if we agree it is not wrong, then we can get into when it should or should not be done.&nbsp; it&#039;s also bringing up the morality of prisons.&nbsp; in the libertarian society that OP speaks of, prisons are still being used.&nbsp; i personally disagree with using prisons at all; i may actually be more of an absolutist on prison than i am on killing!&nbsp; it&#039;s bringing up the idea of what we *need* in a society.&nbsp; for example, what&#039;s the use of roads if you&#039;re always around the people you want to be around?&nbsp; the libertarians seem to be saying that roads may not be useful for everybody, so why should they have to pay for them?&nbsp; absolutely.&nbsp; on the topic of what kind of society we want, i was especially appalled by someone&#039;s comment a few pages back about North America being populated by &quot;savages,&quot; saying that if technological &quot;progress&quot; is to happen, it demands large groups of people.&nbsp; but a more important thing than people&#039;s not having Best Buys is their apparent lack of use for them.<br /><br />it seems to me that if we are fighting for freedom, if we as libertarians or anarchists or drug-users or whatever believe in freedom above all, then we cannot take away someone else&#039;s.&nbsp; so, i guess, no murder, no prison.&nbsp; the truest &quot;punishment&quot; for people who act terribly is ostracization, not by force, but by the committed focus of all the rest of the tribe who is also convinced of their terribleness.&nbsp; it&#039;s not excusing it.&nbsp; it&#039;s just not matching it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				I&#039;ve been away for awhile but it&#039;s fun to come back to this thread. Just reading the last few pages, it&#039;s apparent that there isn&#039;t really a discussion here anymore, it&#039;s just devolved into personal attacks from Stoned Emo and radical rhetoric from kmfkewm. <br /><br />I&#039;d love to discuss how an Agorist or Libertarian system would work in real life. <br />Specifically how these new constructs would work cause I just don&#039;t see nations without police or military or something resembling government. I mean maybe if we all lived in small tribes AND we all had the same thoughts and objectives in each tribe AND we all agreed to leave other tribes alone to their own constructs. I guess then maybe something like it could work .... but what happens when one tribe runs out of food or water or something and their neighboring tribe won&#039;t give it (or sell it) to them? If history shows us anything, the answer is that the 2 tribes will go to war. What then? Whoever has the best army wins I suppose. Better hope your tribe believed in funding a military.

Let them think that drugs are wrong, as soon as they do something to harm a drug user they should be punished. Many pedophiles think that having sex with young children is not wrong, and I do not think that they should be punished for their thoughts, however when they molest children we lock them up. They are not locked up for their thoughts (well, in some cases) but rather for their actions.

The majority of people do not determine what is right or wrong, right and wrong exist independently of any society.

We (the people) have the power to change any law in the US we want. It is the majority of the US population that believes drugs are wrong. We make the laws, and we expect people to enforce them.

You need to seriously look past your statist indoctrination and to the FACTS. The US government started making propaganda demonizing drug use PRIOR to any majority of citizens wanting to make drugs illegal. Only after being BOMBARDED with LIES and PROPAGANDA through the mainstream media, from politicians, etc, did people become AFRAID of drugs and drug users. That is the fucking honest truth! An elite group of RULERS created the drug war, it had NOTHING TO DO with the average citizen except they were used as fucking scared puppets. So fuck off with your talk about democracy and how THE PEOPLE have power, because if THE PEOPLE had power then THE PEOPLE would have made drugs illegal not a select group of government and corporate ELITISTS. They didn&#039;t make any change to the constitution even ! SO FUCK THE NOTION that they can AT A WHIM brainwash EVERYONE and then we are free because after DECADES when their PSYCHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS start to wear off we can slowly start to undo the DAMAGE TO US THAT THEY HAVE CAUSED. That is not fucking freedom, that is not democracy that is motherfucking PSYOP controlled totalitarianism. SO please let me know when you HEAL YOUR BROKEN MIND from the CONDITIONING THAT HAS BEEN INGRAINED INTO IT and see the fucking TRUTH OF THE MATTER. The truth that WE THE PEOPLE had no fucking say in the war on drugs, we were given nothing but lies and propaganda from the VERY FUCKING BEGINNING.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Lol at obsessing with Nazis. They really weren&#039;t that bad. Yes they locked up Jews in camps, but they didn&#039;t mass exterminate them (the only &quot;death&quot; camps were those liberated by Soviets, and the physical evidence of extermination taking place is non existant. Nothing of what was said at the Nuremburg trials regarding the use of Zyklon B to gas Jews was accurate - the testimonies and physical evidence tell two completely different stories. Not to mention that Zyklon B would&#039;ve been really shit at mass extermination, and the Germans had access to far better chemicals for that purpose.) Go learn some history about the holocaust independently. Fascinating subject. But again, it&#039;s funny how people obsess over the Nazi&#039;s but neglect to mention the Jewish Bolsheviks that ran the Soviet Union killed over ten million. Funny how that works&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Back on topic, we should be seeking restitution from those who have perpetrated the drug war, not punishment. The drug war has cost society and individuals dearly, we should work on repairing that damage instead of spilling blood/paying shitloads of money to keep this scum in a cage.

Why the fuck would they even do it if they thought it was wrong? People do not freely carry out actions that they believe to be wrong. The Nazis did not even consider the Jewish population to be humans, they literally thought that Jews had evolved from cockroaches! They thought that the Jews were evil and polluting their race and culture and that the extermination of the Jews was not only righteous but was required for the continued existence of the Aryans. They most certainly , beyond any doubt at all, thought that they were doing the morally correct thing by exterminating the Jews.

I do not believe I directly compared the DEA to Nazis, I merely compared the logic of some of the people in this thread with Nazi sympathizers, and used the Nazis as an example of how &#039;thinking you are doing the right thing&#039; is not an excuse for crimes.

				If you&#039;re saying it was right to go to war with Germany, why not the Soviets? They massacred far more than even the heavily inflated figures for holocaust deaths. You are suffering from holocaust hysteria.<br /><br />I suggest you read Mein Kampf to see what Hitler was about. I don&#039;t exactly agree with him but he had his reasons for disliking the Jews (mainly because of Bolsheviks fucking up Germany). Remember, history is always written by the victors. The losers of war will always be painted as horrific, the winners as glorious. You gotta dig deeper and get both sides of the story if you want to get an accurate picture.

It was wrong to go to war with the Nazi&#039;s&quot;, and then called me an Nazi apologist. That is fucked up.<br /><br />If you took things like, oh say context and moderation into account, you would understand that there is quite a difference between the state committing genocide against an unarmed civilian population and nations sending their soldiers to war. Neither is &quot;good&quot; but I&#039;m gonna have to say that the first example is really really wrong. If you don&#039;t understand why and can&#039;t differentiate the context between the two, then you may as well be some machine that is incapable of critical thinking. If you take any statement to it&#039;s logical extreme it will not make sense. <br />You do a that a lot. Just sayin&#039;.&nbsp; <br /><br />You claim the German people knew about the genocide as it happened - we&#039;ll just have to agree to disagree on this as I know otherwise but it&#039;s useless trying debate it when you&#039;ve got the backing of some all-knowing wikipedia link&nbsp; ::)&nbsp; (The Night of Broken Glass is hardly systematic genocide, but I suppose in your radical mindset it&#039;s the same thing). I still stand by my statement that the Nazi&#039;s knew they were doing the wrong thing - you talk like people would never knowingly do the wrong thing but they do all the time - ever heard of &quot;necessary evil&quot;? It&#039;s a common term used when people try to justify wrongdoing. The Nazi&#039;s used necessary evil to try and eradicate the Jews. They even called it exactly that and never made it public. Sure, some people may have known about it but the vast majority of German&#039;s did not. And no, the Nazi&#039;s did not literally believe that the Jews evolved from cockroaches, they were intelligent people if not somewhat evil. Nuff said on that.<br /><br />Your next claim is that the current government maintains power through fear. (assume you mean US gov.)&nbsp; I somewhat agree, but only using the mildest definition of &quot;fear&quot; - as in &quot;if you don&#039;t vote for us you could be fucked&quot; No one is storm-trooping the man in the street.&nbsp; You mention the movie Reefer Madness as propaganda and motivator of fear - I watched it a while back for entertainment. I don&#039;t believe anybody in the last 30 years really gives it any serious weight. The fact that you would site this as propaganda is a joke.<br /><br />Then you claim that the government actually controls the people through fear, lies and brainwashing and that because of this the people are too confused to and uniformed to create their own righteous rulers. One word bro - Paranoia. People can be stupid for sure, but to claim that all people everywhere are poor little brainwashed victims is just ...stupid<br />Funny that you straight face compare it to Nazi stormtroopers beating opponents - there goes your extremist thing again.<br /><br />Finally you rant about the DEA arbitrarily making drugs illegal, imprisoning people and &quot;being good friends&quot; with Congress. No No and who knows. The DEA does not decide what drugs are illegal, government does, the DEA does not imprison anyone, the judicial system does. I don&#039;t know any DEA or Congress people but I suppose it&#039;s not impossible for one or two of them to personally know and be friends with each other. But who cares, the will of the people just made weed legal in 2 states. Suck on that DEA and Congress.<br /><br /><br />

				1. The DEA has the power to emergency schedule any substance for up to 1.5 years, so yes they can arbitrarily make drugs illegal<br /><br />2. The analog act can be interpreted to make essentially any drug illegal, although at least that needs to be proven in a court<br /><br />3. DEA judges are the ones who determine what schedule a drug will be after it is permanently scheduled. Although sometimes they are overruled, for example a DEA judge originally said that MDMA had medical value but was overruled as it was made schedule one regardless of his recommendation and regardless of massive support from the medical community. <br /><br />4. You are the one who made the claim that killing people is always wrong, perhaps you should articulate yourself clearly if you don&#039;t want to be called on your shitty logic. If killing people is wrong it is wrong to kill Nazis, if it is not wrong to kill Nazis then killing people is not always wrong. Sorry, I am a very literal person and I will take what you say as you have said it, if you want to not be misunderstood I highly suggest that you learn to clearly and precisely articulate your thoughts. It is not my problem that you do not know how to clearly communicate your thoughts. <br /><br />5. Some of the Nazis did literally believe that Jews evolved from cockroaches, and they were not particularly intelligent people; indeed they were quite delusional. <br /><br />http://www.toughissues.org/handoutsnew/Nazi%20Antisemitism.htm<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Whereas [Ed.: to the Nazis] the Slavs were subhuman [Ed.: German: Untermenschen], the Jews were nonhuman. Hitler saw the Jews as a kind of anti-race, a nomadic mongrel group. Because contact with Jews would [Ed.: according to the Nazis] corrupt German blood and culture, Jews would be segregated, a segregation that led to the possibility of annihilation. In segregating the Jews, the Nazis followed the traditional Christian policy that viewed the Jew, the ‘Other’, as essentially different and somehow inherently dangerous, a danger to be avoided. In elaborating their concept of the Jews as nonhuman, the Nazis described them as parasites, viruses, or loathsome creatures from the animal and insect world (rats, cockroaches). As a parasitic force [Ed.: according to the Nazis], the Jews corroded, and would ultimately destroy, the cultures of their host nations.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To the Nazis the ‘Jewish problem’ was a problem of cosmic importance. Human survival itself depended on the fate of the 17 million Jews inhabiting the globe. Should the Jews be successful in their quest for world domination, the Nazis said, they would deny existence to all others. Human survival depended, therefore, on the victory of the forces of light (Aryans) over the forces of darkness (Jews).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; …The Nazis, then, accused the Jews of wanting to do what they, the Nazis, were out to do themselves: control the world and annihilate their enemies.

I guess we will just need to agree to disagree on if the German people knew about the mass extermination of the Jews, I guess I can take comfort in knowing that historians agree with me. <br /><br />7.

Today it is blatantly obvious propaganda, but just because today we have gotten past their brainwashing enough that we can see examples of it from decades ago, is not by any means a reason to pretend that decades ago they did not succeed in brainwashing people.

Refeer madness scared people decades ago, today we can see that it is obviously bullshit so they need to adapt to the times with new lies and propaganda. You act like refeer madness was made as a joke, and that is entirely dishonest. It was made as propaganda, it worked as propaganda, it wore off as all propaganda does and so they evolved their lies and propaganda to what we have today. LSD chromosome damage? Marijuana and impotency?! Videos of people smoking marijuana and having their brainwaves flatten (oh but those are not real brainwave reading devices it is all props!). The list of lies is so enormous that I can&#039;t even begin to start. And guess what THE PEOPLE, who you think are so powerful , were LIED TO prior to them forming their opinions on drugs. They are taught in the government schools LIES about drugs as if the lies are true facts, they are bombarded through the media with government sponsored and endorsed LIES, and it is plain as day to see that this is happening and it is plain as day to see that this has been happening for DECADES. So really it is a fucking joke for you to say that THE PEOPLE have the power and THE PEOPLE want drugs illegal and the government is a reflection of THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE are heavily indoctrinated to the point that the wishes of the people are a reflection of the governments propaganda, so saying the government is a reflection of the people is not at all the full story, the people are a reflection of the government lies and propaganda. They are not informed, they are intentionally misinformed by the government. That is what democracy turns into, it is not the will of the people it is the will of those who control the people. That is the honest truth and if you cannot see the truth that is your problem but it doesn&#039;t change reality at all.<br /><br />People are surrounded with lies and indoctrination, in schools, through the media, I SEE THESE THINGS. I am a witness to what is taking place, there is no paranoia on my part there is nothing more than observation and having an intelligent and rational mind that is capable of seeing things for what they are. There is no conspiracy in my mind other than the conspiracy my mind clearly and correctly perceives taking place in the world!<br />

				Here is a thought experiment for you. I would like you to tell me which of two groups (group A or group B) is more free. The two groups each consist of thirty people. They live in separate remote regions of the earth and are to determine the legality of the chemical substance DHMO. <br /><br />Group A is told by armed men that if they do not vote to make DHMO a controlled substance, they will be killed. Some of them are beaten severely prior to the voting taking place, as a testament to the serious nature of the anti DHMO force. They are then allowed to vote on the status of DHMO, although the anti DHMO thugs stand guard at the polling stations and they wave pistols at those going to vote telling them that they had better make the correct choice. <br /><br />Group B is not threatened physically, however leading up to the vote they are given the following pamphlets that I will quote for you soon. These pamphlets are distributed to them through their community schools, and their local television and radio stations are keen to discuss some of the mentioned points in a dramatic fashion. Some of their elected leaders, who they have always thought to trust, have also expressed their support of the ban on DHMO for the reasons given in the pamphlet. Even their religious leaders have expressed their dislike of DHMO. They are not threatened in the slightest and are free to vote as they please. Here is the pamphlet:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should I be concerned about Dihydrogen Monoxide?<br />Yes, you should be concerned about DHMO! Although the U.S. Government and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) do not classify Dihydrogen Monoxide as a toxic or carcinogenic substance (as it does with better known chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and benzene), DHMO is a constituent of many known toxic substances, diseases and disease-causing agents, environmental hazards and can even be lethal to humans in quantities as small as a thimbleful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research conducted by award-winning U.S. scientist Nathan Zohner concluded that roughly 86 percent of the population supports a ban on dihydrogen monoxide. Although his results are preliminary, Zohner believes people need to pay closer attention to the information presented to them regarding Dihydrogen Monoxide. He adds that if more people knew the truth about DHMO then studies like the one he conducted would not be necessary.<br /><br />A similar study conducted by U.S. researchers Patrick K. McCluskey and Matthew Kulick also found that nearly 90 percent of the citizens participating in their study were willing to sign a petition to support an outright ban on the use of Dihydrogen Monoxide in the United States.<br />Why haven&#039;t I heard about Dihydrogen Monoxide before?<br />Good question. Historically, the dangers of DHMO, for the most part, have been considered minor and manageable. While the more significant dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide are currently addressed by a number of agencies including FDA, FEMA and CDC, public awareness of the real and daily dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide is lower than some think it should be.<br />Critics of government often cite the fact that many politicians and others in public office do not consider Dihydrogen Monoxide to be a &quot;politically beneficial&quot; cause to get behind, and so the public suffers from a lack of reliable information on just what DHMO is and why they should be concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the blame lies with the public and society at large. Many do not take the time to understand Dihydrogen Monoxide, and what it means to their lives and the lives of their families.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the dangers of DHMO have increased as world population has increased, a fact that the raw numbers and careful research both bear out. Now more than ever, it is important to be aware of just what the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide are and how we can all reduce the risks faced by ourselves and our families.<br />What are some of the dangers associated with DHMO?<br />Each year, Dihydrogen Monoxide is a known causative component in many thousands of deaths and is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars in damage to property and the environment. Some of the known perils of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DHMO is a major component of acid rain.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Contributes to soil erosion.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Contamination of electrical systems often causes short-circuits.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Exposure decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Found in biopsies of pre-cancerous tumors and lesions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Given to vicious dogs involved in recent deadly attacks.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Often associated with killer cyclones in the U.S. Midwest and elsewhere, and in hurricanes including deadly storms in Florida, New Orleans and other areas of the southeastern U.S.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Thermal variations in DHMO are a suspected contributor to the El Nino weather effect.<br /><br />What are some uses of Dihydrogen Monoxide?<br />Despite the known dangers of DHMO, it continues to be used daily by industry, government, and even in private homes across the U.S. and worldwide. Some of the well-known uses of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as an industrial solvent and coolant,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in nuclear power plants,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by the U.S. Navy in the propulsion systems of some older vessels,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by elite athletes to improve performance,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in the production of Styrofoam,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in biological and chemical weapons manufacture,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in the development of genetically engineering crops and animals,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as a spray-on fire suppressant and retardant,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in so-called &quot;family planning&quot; or &quot;reproductive health&quot; clinics,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as a major ingredient in many home-brewed bombs,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as a byproduct of hydrocarbon combustion in furnaces and air conditioning compressor operation,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in cult rituals,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by the Church of Scientology on their members and their members&#039; families (although surprisingly, many members recently have contacted DHMO.org to vehemently deny such use),<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by both the KKK and the NAACP during rallies and marches,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by members of Congress who are under investigation for financial corruption and inappropriate IM behavior,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by&nbsp; kids who play Beyblades,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by the clientele at a number of bath houses in New York City and San Francisco,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; historically, in Hitler&#039;s death camps in Nazi Germany, and in prisons in Turkey, Serbia, Croatia, Libya, Iraq and Iran,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in World War II prison camps in Japan, and in prisons in China, for various forms of torture,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; during many recent religious and ethnic wars in the Middle East,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by many terrorist organizations including al Qaeda,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in community swimming pools to maintain chemical balance,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in day care centers, purportedly for sanitary purposes,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by software engineers, including those producing DICOM software and other DICOM software tools,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by popular computer science professors,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by the semi-divine King Bhumibol of Thailand and his many devoted young working girls in Bangkok,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by the British Chiropractic Association and the purveyors of the bogus treatments that the BCA promotes,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; by commodities giant Trafigura in their well-publicized and widely-known toxic-waste dumping activities in Ivory Coast,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in animal research laboratories, and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in pesticide production and distribution.<br /><br />What you may find surprising are some of the products and places where DHMO is used, but which for one reason or another, are not normally made part of public presentations on the dangers to the lives of our family members and friends. Among these startling uses are:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as an additive to food products, including jarred baby food and baby formula, and even in many soups, carbonated beverages and supposedly &quot;all-natural&quot; fruit juices<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in cough medicines and other liquid pharmaceuticals,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in spray-on oven cleaners,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in shampoos, shaving creams, deodorants and numerous other bathroom products,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in bathtub bubble products marketed to children,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as a preservative in grocery store fresh produce sections,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in the production of beer by all the major beer distributors,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in the coffee available at major coffee houses in the US and abroad,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; in Formula One race cars, although its use is regulated by the Formula One Racing Commission, and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; as a target of ongoing NASA planetary and stellar research.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most surprising facts recently revealed about Dihydrogen Monoxide contamination is in its use as a food and produce &quot;decontaminant.&quot; Studies have shown that even after careful washing, food and produce that has been contaminated by DHMO remains tainted by DHMO.<br />What is the link between Dihydrogen Monoxide and school violence?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent stunning revelation is that in every single instance of violence in our country&#039;s schools, including infamous shootings in high schools in Denver and Arkansas, Dihydrogen Monoxide was involved. In fact, DHMO is often very available to students of all ages within the assumed safe confines of school buildings. None of the school administrators with which we spoke could say for certain how much of the substance is in use within their very hallways.<br />How does Dihydrogen Monoxide toxicity affect kidney dialysis patients?<br />Unfortunately, DHMO overdose is not unheard of in patients undergoing dialysis treatments for kidney failure. Dihydrogen Monoxide overdose in these patients can result in congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and hypertension. In spite of the danger of accidental overdose and the inherent toxicity of DHMO in large quantities for this group, there is a portion of the dialysis treated population that continues to use DHMO on a regular basis.<br />Are there groups that oppose a ban on Dihydrogen Monoxide?<br />In spite of overwhelming evidence, there is one group in California that opposes a ban on Dihydrogen Monoxide. The Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide is a group that believes that the dangers of DHMO have been exaggerated. Members claim that Dihydrogen Monoxide, or the less emotionally charged and more chemically accurate term they advocate for it, &quot;Hydrogen Hydroxide,&quot; is beneficial, environmentally safe, benign and naturally occurring. They argue that efforts to ban DHMO are misguided.<br /><br />Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide is supported by the Scorched Earth Party, a radical and loosely-organized California-based group. Sources close to the Scorched Earth Party deny any outside funding from government, industry or pro-industry PACs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Has the press ignored this web site and the Dihydrogen Monoxide problem?<br />For the most part, the press has not reported on the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide as much as some would like. Although many private individuals have put up web sites in a major grassroots effort to spread the word, major publications have not.<br /><br />Recently, attention has been paid to the subject thanks to an incident in Aliso Viejo, California.&nbsp; This so-called Aliso Viejo Incident was widely reported in the media, although the director of DHMO.org, Dr. Tom Way, was called a &quot;prankster.&quot;&nbsp; Once the Associated Press started circulating the story, it became fact, and the valuable information being provided by the DHMO.org website was deemed to be &quot;rubbish&quot; rather than an honest and unbiased recounting of facts about a dangerous, life-endangering chemical compound.<br /><br />If you are a member of the press, you may access our online Press Kit.&nbsp; See the main page for access information.&nbsp; This resource is for members of the press only.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />Is it true that using DHMO improves athletic performance?<br />Absolutely! With the numerous allegations of amateur and professional athletes using anabolic steroids and/or blood doping to enhance performance, virtually no attention has been paid to the performance enhancing properties of Dihydrogen Monoxide. It is perhaps the sporting world&#039;s dirtiest of dirty little secrets that athletes regularly ingest large quantities of DHMO in an effort to gain a competitive edge over an opponent.<br /><br />One technique commonly used by endurance athletes in sports such as distance running and cycling is to take a large amount of DHMO immediately prior to a race. This is known within racing circles to dramatically improve performance.<br /><br />Sports-medicine physicians warn that ingesting too much Dihydrogen Monoxide can lead to complications and unwanted side-effects, but do acknowledge the link to improved performance. DHMO is not currently considered a banned substance, so post-race urine tests do not detect elevated or abnormal levels of DHMO.<br />Can using DHMO improve my marriage?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a popular myth, but one which is also actually supported by a number of scientific facts. Dihydrogen Monoxide plays an instrumental role in the centers of the brain associated with feelings of emotional attachment and love. Married couples have found that regular ingestion of DHMO can improve their marriage-related activities, while couples that never ingest DHMO often find that their marriage suffers as well. <br />What are the symptoms of accidental Dihydrogen Monoxide overdose?<br />You may not always recognize that you have been a victim of accidental DHMO overdose, so here are some signs and symptoms to look for. If you suspect Dihydrogen Monoxide overdose, or if you exhibit any of these symptoms, you should consult with your physician or medical practitioner. The data presented here is provided for informational purposes only, and should in no way be construed as medical advice of any sort.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Watch for these symptoms:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Excessive sweating<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Excessive urination<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Bloated feeling<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Nausea<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Vomiting<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Electrolyte imbalance<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Hyponatremia (serum hypotonicity)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Dangerously imbalanced levels of ECF and ICF in the blood<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Degeneration of sodium homeostasis<br /><br />A recently noted medical phenomenon involves small amounts of DHMO leaking or oozing from the corners of the eyes as a direct result of causes such as foreign particulate irritation, allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock, and sometimes severe chemical depression.<br />What is a chemical analysis of Dihydrogen Monoxide<br />Recently, German analytical chemist Christoph von Bueltzingsloewen at the Universitaet Regensburg identified what may be key reasons why the dangers of DHMO are ever present. According to von Bueltzingsloewen, the chemical separation of dihydrogenoxide from the hazardous oxygendihydride is extremely difficult. The two similar compounds curiously occur in nearly equimolar distribution wherever they are found. It is not clear how the two contribute directly to the dangers inherent in Dihydrogen Monoxide, although von Bueltzingsloewen believes that a synergetic mechanism, catalyzed by traces of hydrogenhydroxide, plays a major role. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />What can I do to minimize the risks?<br />Fortunately, there is much you can do to minimize your dangers due to Dihydrogen Monoxide exposure. First, use common sense. Whenever you are dealing with any product or food that you feel may be contaminated with DHMO, evaluate the relative danger to you and your family, and act accordingly. Keep in mind that in many instances, low-levels of Dihydrogen Monoxide contamination are not dangerous, and in fact, are virtually unavoidable. Remember, the responsibility for your safety and the safety of your family lies with you.<br /><br />Second, exercise caution when there is the potential for accidental inhalation or ingestion of DHMO. If you feel uncomfortable, remove yourself from a dangerous situation. Better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Third, don&#039;t panic. Although the dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide are very real, by exercising caution and common sense, you can rest assured knowing that you are doing everything possible to keep you and your family safe.<br />How can I find out more about Dihydrogen Monoxide?<br />We would be happy to tell you more about DHMO! Send us email at director_at_dhmo_dot_org, and we&#039;ll gladly attempt to keep you up-to-date on current developments in the study of Dihydrogen Monoxide, its uses and misuses.<br /><br />There are a number of sites on the world wide web that contain more information on DHMO and related topics. It should be noted that we do not endorse these sites, nor do we control their content or political bias. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Please tell me which of these two groups is free ?

You can say that it was still your choice, however stupid, not to choose a protection agency to protect you in a state of anarchy and therefore you chose to die at their hands.

Since you clearly have a very poor understanding of what a “free market” is this is obviously not something you know and if you look closely you’ll see I already answered what you’re arguing here. So what if there’s no nation with a working libertarian utopia? As I already said, free markets don’t provide you with an infinite set of options. You’re limited to buying what a free market produces, even if it doesn’t have ideally what you want. If you can’t find your dream home you’ll just have to settle for what’s available on the free market or you can build your own. If you can’t find your ideal country, nothing’s preventing you from buying an island out in middle of nowhere and living in a state of libertarian anarchy there. Or building a gigantic yacht/artificial island, sailing into international waters, and hoisting up a flag with a marijuana leaf on it while growing dope on your sovereign country-boat governed as a libertarian anarchy. Just like no one said building your dream home as an alternative to free market choices would be a cheap or easy endevour. You could say you don’t have the option of not spending at all on any of the options available but that would only reflect your poor understanding of a free market. If you can’t find your dream home, you can’t really opt out of spending money on a place to rent or own either since the alternative, homelessness, isn’t much of a choice any more than opting out of paying taxes and getting imprisoned is much of a choice. The point is that you do have a choice of close to 200 countries you could emigrate to. They are the product of an anarcho-capitalist free market. There is no one-world super-government dictating to sovereign countries. In this sense the market of nations is a much purer “free market” than the markets within those nations governed by those nations laws and regulations.&nbsp; Looking more closely at your comments you seem to have the idea that the “free market” should produce exactly what you want free from the costs of making market choices which is patently absurd.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Indeed, and wouldn&#039;t you rather spend your money only on the things that you agree with?

Maybe you should. It’s amazing how poorly you’ve thought this through. What about the fact that what your neighbor spends on defense directly affects your defense budget and your property value? That cohesive, common neighborhood defense could be all that separates your secure, upscale neighborhood from becoming a violent ghetto? That if your neighbors chose to pool their resources for more comprehensive security and you didn’t, then you would be a freeloader because you would get residual benefit from the pooling of resources? You seem to have put no thought into all the ramifications and logistics that the defense of your property by you alone would require. Or how horribly inefficient and astronomically costly it would be for both security agencies and homeowners alike if each hired a different agency to protect their property ... if it’s even logistically feasible since you’d need a world labor force that consisted primarily of private protective militias.&nbsp; It doesn’t sound like most people would even be able to afford anything but a cooperative, common defense even if you could pay a militia to defend your property, you’d be the exception.&nbsp; Curious how a person would need to buy all these things; food, clothing, shelter, education, medicine, sanitation, justice, police, all forms of security and insurance, even permission to use the streets (for these also would be privately owned), yet in your utopian vision everybody always has enough money and time to act as discerning buyer of all these things! Remarkable! <br />I think you’d quickly find that life would be much easier and far less expensive with proximal cooperation on some level to take advantage of distribution of labor. You wouldn’t want to spend all your time and resources on defense of your home. If you even survived the quality of your life would be shit, not to mention you would be hard pressed to afford anything else.<br />Let me also remind you that we have social safety nets in place, medicare, social security, unemployment, food stamps, welfare, so that you don’t have the weakest, or temporarily unlucky, members of society dying in the streets. If you think private charities will somehow swoop all the feeble, old, laid off, and those no longer able to care or provide for themselves away then you’re living in fantasy land. Yours is a dog eat dog world of extreme competition where ones options are work, beg, or die. How are private charities supposed to stay funded to even current levels when there’s no government incentive to give to them to provide a tax writeoff? How much you wanna bet that those affected by no social safety net would think you a lunatic for calling&nbsp; privatized anarchy “exactly what we have now”?!<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Indeed and Jews could have moved from Nazi Germany prior to the holocaust so their extermination is to be blamed only on them. They were free! You understanding of what a free market is is extremely incorrect.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />It’s amazing that anyone would use such a blindingly retarded analogy. Generally speaking, the DEA is not perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity. If you think they are, then you really need to look up what those things even mean. Second, it’s blindingly stupid because Jews had no way of knowing that the holocaust was going to happen before the holocaust happened. Many felt persecuted yes, and as a result bailed. Mass slaughter even occurred, but not to the extent of the holocaust since extermination camps weren’t built and industrialized mass slaughter didn’t begin until Hitler decided on the “final solution” to the “Jewish problem”, so to imply that Jews could predict the future holocaust so that those who died in it went to their deaths of their own volition is just asinine. I’m noticing an affinity you seem to have for very poorly thought through analogies and ideas.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Guess what, a critical mass of the population didn&#039;t give two shits about drug use until the United States federal government pushed out a bunch of propaganda and conditioned them into accepting that the war on drugs was a good thing and drugs were bad. Look at things like reefer madness , do you think the people who made that propaganda thought that it was honest truth? No, people who make propaganda at the highest levels understand that it is false and lies. The government lied to the people to justify imprisoning and enslaving millions of its own citizens for the profit of private interests. They have literally sold us into prison industrial slavery, and no our neighbors did not decide to do this on their own, they were conditioned into it by a group of powerful elites who would profit from our slavery </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Dude, the fact you’re citing Reefer Madness here as government propaganda to lie, enslave, and imprison people proves that, at least on this subject, you’re truly a fucking blithering idiot ... a fucking imbecile.&nbsp; Reefer Madness was funded by a church group in 1936 with the intent of teaching the public a “morality tale” on the dangers of marijuana use. The church group lied because they thought they knew better. It was fucking 1936!&nbsp; Think about that for a minute.&nbsp; Marijuana research and public knowledge of it was non-existent, so the church group used an alarmist approach that preyed on their own fears of the unknown to scare people into going to church and finding god in fear of the “demon weed” that created axe murderers. It was later purchased by a private maverick exploitation producer/director who re-cut it for the FOR PROFIT exploitation film circuit before it sat dormant for a couple decades until it was rediscovered and purchased in the early 70’s by the founder of NORML who began showing it at pro pot festivals where it became a hit with the mass public as a cult film BECAUSE it is such a patently ridiculous over the top JOKE. So this film was originally created and distributed by a religious group, then mass distributed by a private producer as SHOCK SATIRE on the EXPLOITATION CIRCUIT, before turning into an unintentional comedy cult film by the founder of NORML. At NO POINT was the GOVERNMENT at your so called “highest levels” involved in the production or distribution of this film. Get it?&nbsp; So even though it turns out that locking people up on marijuana charges has become very profitable for the private sector prison industrial complex,&nbsp; not only did Reefer Madness have nothing to do with the government, but in 1936 the prison industry WASN’T EVEN CLOSE TO BEING PRIVATIZED YET nor was there any way to predict prison privatization happening 50 YEARS LATER during Ronald Reagan’s push to privatize in the 1980’s that turned modern private prisons into cash cows. Dude get a grip.<br />Also can’t help but note the irony of the evils brought on by privatizing the prison industry when that’s precisely what you’re advocating in the privatizing of everything in your anarcho-libertarian utopia. Here’s an industry that I think is far better left in the public sector where it’s subject to public standards of accountability. I have far less of a problem with prison labor funding public interests and public works than I do with it lining the pockets of CCA shareholders and its board of directors. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Democracy is a flawed system, the masses are too easily manipulated for it to be meaningful in the slightest.

And this is your victory of democracy?! </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Democracy is the worst system in the world, until you compare it to all the other systems of government. There is no perfect system of government, but to suggest we go from an imperfect but far more functional than all the rest as proven by recorded history system of gov to a state of total anarchy is some seriously fucked up thinking. Over time, we’ve tended to self correct and come out alright. We&#039;ve made serious mistakes, sometimes dodging apocalypse by a combination of luck and determination. We&#039;ve allowed our government take action in barbaric ways – internment camps, Vietnam, Iraq. And as citizens, we&#039;ve stood by while injustices rolled over lives as in the war on drugs. But as a nation we tend to learn from our mistakes; we tend to correct them as best we can. Our always re-enforced self-interest and offhand sense of fairness produces a sort of lazy arc toward justice. Frustration and outrage brings wars to an end. Protest and disenchantment allow rights to expand, to not acknowledge the progress we’ve made as a country is just blind. But most importantly, there’s a system of government jointly owned by the people with checks and balances in place run by elected representatives for when we do decide to self correct and do the right thing. There is no such self correcting mechanism in a state of anarchy but absolute force subject to the whims of whoever is wielding that force.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So then they can move on to the next behavior that will be demonized and prosecuted, and the new masses will be conditioned by the new generation of propaganda and lies?!

In my vision all goods are private, so there is no need to provide public goods and thus your dubious claim that private industry can not provide them is entirely irrelevant. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>OK, let’s conduct a thought experiment based on your anarchic utopia. Why should the boundaries of your property even be recognized by anyone else? If there’s no communal cooperation of any sort with neighbors where you agree upon the rules of property delineation, then it comes down to what you’re capable of defending on your own or paying an agency to defend your territorial rights. You’ll quickly discover this is a horribly expensive and inefficient way of doing things while your neighbors will find it far more cost effective and efficent to agree on a neighborhood state where they pay a fraction of what you’re paying for common defense while agreeing on a set of common rules for property delineation. Unless you’re far wealthier, you simply won’t survive matched up against the resources of a cooperative community of those who agree on a united common defense and have no reason to recognize what you claim is your property. So if you want to live, you’re gonna have to start getting used to the concept of cooperating with your neighbor on matters of common agreement unless you want to just hope that whenever this anarchy starts you’ve horded so much wealth that you can build your own fortress.<br />Public goods the private industry on its own has never shown a willingness to pay for on its own? Roads, bridges, clean water, clean air, environmental protections. These are public goods. If you’re insisting that roads and bridges are private, then you’re inviting a whole host of problems with monopolistic price fixing. Are you really still trying to insist such a system is “exactly what we have now”? If so, I have to ask whether you’re autistic, because despite this being your stated ideology it appears you’ve never bothered to think these things through.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I have attended private and public schools in a similar socioeconomic setting, I can say that in my opinion private education is superior.

I attended both private and public schools in similar SES too and I didn’t find one clearly superior to the other although I strongly preferred the public setting free of religious indoctrination. That Time article focused on the achievement score superiority of the private Jesuit setting but failed to determine why. In retrospect I can see how the private environment was much stricter, which could have led to a better educational environment for those lacking motivation and acts as a natural filter in expelling the worst performers who would then be left for the public school system to clean up. So I can see that easily as being the cause for the difference. But I don’t see how the stricter environment was a product of it being a private, for profit enterprise. Strictness seemed to be more a byproduct of the Jesuit heritage. The DoE report found education varied widely with excellent and shitty schools among all types; private, public, charter, religious. <br />

Because when it comes down to it, it’s strictly your opinion that your libertarian anarchist worldview is the “right” one and therefore “statism” is indoctrination at all. I always find it amusing that anarcho-libertarians throw around the word “statist” as a pejorative as if the person being labeled is supposed to feel insulted if they even know what it means. I feel about as insulted as if a Marxist were to call me bourgeois. Oooooh. Really? I’m bourgeois, how horrible! Not. It’s hard to be insulted when I’m perfectly comfortable with the meaning of the label and more overwhelmed with pity for that person and the narrow, self righteous prism through which they view the world. So when you try to bring up the evils of “statist indoctrination” as comparative to religious indoctrination to someone you would deem a statist, you can’t expect that person is going to find your argument compelling or that your use of it would make you look like anything more than certifiably insane. There might be a propaganda program like DARE reflective of the broader societal values of the state that I don’t agree with. But there’s nothing that specifically makes DARE a necessary component of what you would call “statism”. <br />There are a lot of people who think you’re totally off your rocker for thinking a purely privatized society would function any better than feudalisms and despotisms of the past, and wouldn’t see any value in the anarcho indoctrination you espouse. But it wouldn’t mean anything to you if a person told you about the hypothetical evils of a private schools providing kids anarcho-indoctrination, in fact you would probably commend it. Likewise, you’re so sucked into your “I am right, everyone else is wrong” mentality that you can’t discern how preposterous you sound when deeming statist indoctrination an evil to statists.&nbsp; And your self righteous sanctimony couldn’t be more overbearing than your description of public schools “entirely funded by gun toting IRS agents extorting money from people”.&nbsp; Again, this is strictly your opinion as many people paying taxes would disagree and find your characterization obscene and recognize the many benefits of government that you don’t believe exist. <br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Religious people already force me to fund the neighborhood public school, so once again in your nightmare &#039;free market&#039; society nothing has changed except the name Government and the people in charge. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Wow.

There were a number that were charged under the more nebulous “crimes against peace” or waging “wars of aggression” that were acquitted or received some time in jail, but were NOT put to death. What you’re proposing doing to the DEA where they’re all lined up and shot with no trial to determine guilt or culpability is FAR FAR worse than what happened to the Nazis.

				This a cool hypothetical, but I have to agree with some of the others that comparing DEA agents to Nazis is pretty overboard. Would I love it if Michelle Leonhart and her cronies were all lined up in front of a firing squad? Absolutely and let me be an executioner. It irritates me to no end how that woman can sit in front of a senate hearing committee with the glazed over look in her eyes of way too many prescription opioids and argue in response to Cannabis&#039; medical value and safety compared to Heroin and Cocaine and say &quot;Umm, I believe that all illegal drugs are bad.&quot;. I&#039;d love a DEA PIG branded into each and every one of their arms and foreheads, or some tattoo stating how many people they robbed of their freedom. The greatest justice we can truly have against them is the day when our Government obeys the will of the people over its own interests and ends the drug war, because every single one of them will be scrambling to find a new job, and the 2.5 billion plus drain on our economy annually will finally cease. Plus all 50 states now have Secession petitions with thousands of signatures a piece. I&#039;d love for another Civil War, because we all know which side the DEA would take, and it&#039;d be their demise.

Let the people who want to teach lies to children fund the DARE programs and leave my money to me, I will put it toward doing things like real drug research so that we can learn more about drugs and harm reduction. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There are a lot of people who think you’re totally off your rocker for thinking a purely privatized society would function any better than feudalisms and despotisms of the past, and wouldn’t see any value in the anarcho indoctrination you espouse. But it wouldn’t mean anything to you if a person told you about the hypothetical evils of a private schools providing kids anarcho-indoctrination, in fact you would probably commend it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Indeed I would commend it and likely would voluntarily put funding into an anarcho-capitalist schooling system (I mean, I do like to learn things, I just don&#039;t like to learn bullshit, or be forced to pay for the government to indoctrinate more children to their agenda). If you would like to continue wasting your money on teaching kids propaganda, feel free to do so I will not stop you or make you fund what I want either :). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Likewise, you’re so sucked into your “I am right, everyone else is wrong” mentality that you can’t discern how preposterous you sound when deeming statist indoctrination an evil to statists.&nbsp; And your self righteous sanctimony couldn’t be more overbearing than your description of public schools “entirely funded by gun toting IRS agents extorting money from people”.&nbsp; Again, this is strictly your opinion as many people paying taxes would disagree and find your characterization obscene and recognize the many benefits of government that you don’t believe exist. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course everyone indoctrinates children to some extent, it is largely impossible to avoid. The difference is that in your system the propaganda is paid for via force and it is essentially forced onto everyone! I have no choice but to fund D.A.R.E, I have no choice but to fund the D.E.A, I don&#039;t like either of these establishments! I do not want to fund these establishments or programs! People with guns in the IRS demand that I do, if I do not they will throw me into a fucking prison. There is no analogy being made between the IRS and a band of gun waving extortionists, that is what the IRS is! Let the many people paying taxes who want to continue paying taxes continue paying them! I imagine when they are not threatened by men waving guns they will see no reason to throw their money away into programs and establishments that they don&#039;t support and that they are against! Let those who agree with me be free , and otherwise it is clear who the aggressor is and it is clear who wants to claim ownership of us. I say we own ourselves, in your world we are owned by the collective and it is bullshit. I will not accept that that is righteous as it clearly is not.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wow. You really are clueless that you do in fact get reciprocal benefit from funding education even if you or your family member aren’t attending publicly funded schools. You see, educating people benefits our entire society. It greases the skids of capitalism having an educated labor force that can build upon, rather than reinvent the wheel. You benefit living in a more enlightened and educated society even if there might be aspects, like the war on drugs, that you don’t agree with. These are the sorts of things I would expect to explain to a child with an instinctively limited, short sighted vision of the world ... not an adult.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course I know that it is better for us all if we are all educated. Perhaps I will donate charitably to a school that provides education freely. I will NOT fund such a school if they teach D.A.R.E , I will not fund such a school if they teach intelligent design either. Now I am EMPOWERED to support what I WANT instead of FORCED TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO WISH TO OPPRESS ME. See the difference? It is not that hard to understand, I am sure if you put a little bit of effort into it you can free yourself from your mental slavery. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So fucking what? I have a hard time believing you could possibly be that naive to think there aren’t differences between the virtual and real world. Your willingness to just dismiss the pervasive state of tyranny throughout the history of private states and private law is just mind boggling.&nbsp; At the same time I also can’t help but note the irony and hypocrisy in your “look where you’re typing this” comment. Yeah look. The OSI model and related tech on which the internet is based was originally developed by GOVERNMENT, more specifically the US Department of Defense, would not exist if not for government. The TOR anonymizing tech was originally developed by the US NAVY. These key technologies from which you now base your livelihood were not conceived of by private companies but by GOVERNMENT. So yeah, look at where you’re typing this.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You are naive if you cannot see how the virtual world is changing the real world. <br /><br />Although I can appreciate the irony of the fact that we are on an internet that was originally created by the US government, and that even the Tor of today (The military made the concept not the implementation) has some level of connection to the US government (not that there are not privately funded solutions from libertarians and anarchists, like I2P and Freenet), it is naive to assume that similar solutions would not have arrived through the free market (and indeed there are plenty of anarcho-libertarian&nbsp; / cryptoanarchist created technologies and networks). The US government does still give large amounts of funding to Tor, this is of course our stolen tax dollars at work. I would continue to support Tor financially even if I were not obligated to do so by the government, because I believe in what Tor stands for and I recognize that it is one of the better low latency anonymity solutions. D.E.A I would not fund because I am very against them and I hope that their field agents are lined up and executed by firing squads. <br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wow. Talk about pie in the sky. If you seriously think there’s no difference between the society you live in now and the feudalistic, monarchistic, despotistic, fiefdoms of the purely private states of the past then you are literally so far gone in your anarachic fantasia land that I honestly don’t see a redeemable pathway back for you.&nbsp; So if you say I suffer from cognitive dissonance when I’m using history as my empirical guide as to why your utopia wouldn’t work, what would that make you when you have absolutely no real world empirical model for which your utopian society has ever worked? Think about that for a while.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&quot;We have been slaves and thus we shall remain slaves&quot; . That is what you just said essentially, and unfortunately it is hard to argue against it but I see everyday that we are making progress. I see that we are protecting our people from oppressive agencies like the D.E.A. , and it gives me hope that someday we will do even better. They have trillions of dollars and paramilitary armies to enslave us, and still I have friends stacking up millions of dollars selling drugs to willing customers. Still I am using LSD even right now I am tripping balls :). Unfortunately we still take our losses, Enelysion for example is a good friend of mine who got pinched by the department of homeland security for selling drugs online. He will probably spend most of his life in prison now, I guess joot too although I didn&#039;t know him as well. Nice to know that I am forced to pay for the agencies that are locking up my innocent friends huh? That is really freedom in your broken mind. But I know that we are just getting better and better and bigger and bigger and you know what not shit is going to stop the online drug scene. And we wont always be the victims either, someday those fuckers will see that they can be touched, and I feel no pity for them when that day comes, and there will be no excuses for them when that day comes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">And it’s this where I pretty much throw up my hands at a zealot whose mind appears far gone into a bizarre and unfathomable religion that you can’t discern reality from fantasy. To claim we live in a totalitarian state is not reality. You should speak to some people who actually have lived in a totalitarian state. You should study history to learn what it’s actually like living in a totalitarian state. We don’t live in one, no matter how much you think you’re nothing more than a forced slave. I bet if you lived in a real totalitarian state you would think differently.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I live in a state that censors information and sends people who access censored information to die in prisons. I live in a state where I am forced to fund the imprisonment of my friends. I live in a state where I must hide from the police. I live in a state where my friends don&#039;t even know who they can trust because the person you thought was your best friend was an undercover DEA agent. I live in a totalitarian state, beyond any doubt in my mind. The details are all that differs when comparing my state with any other totalitarian state you can name. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Degrees of slavery huh? Why not say there are degrees of freedom instead and that slavery is only absolute?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">More pie in the sky idealism on your part. You think all security agencies would have an equal amount of power? Of course not. You think they’re all going to battle against each other and risk death when they could just collaborate, divide up the territorial pie, and violate your rights at will? And please spare me the bullshit about how that’s essentially what we have now when we have constitutional protections against arbitrary violation of our rights that private law has never shown it could duplicate because private law solely serves the owners of private law. It’s funny how you rail against constitutional democracy as being pwned by private interests and the elite and advocate instead that we dive headfirst into a system purely pwned and controlled by private interests and the elite. Talk about fucking insanity, what you’re promoting is it.&nbsp; <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thinking that we have constitutional rights is pie in the sky idealism. We are given the right to free speech and freedom of the press, and millions are in prisons for possessing the wrong pictures. We have the promise that religions will not be favored and religions are granted exceptions to the controlled substance act and can possess mescaline, dmt. We are told that we are free from slavery, what about the draft do you think the people who died in Vietnam were not mostly government slaves? <br /><br />Again I will say, your fear of anarchy appears to be that it will turn into government. Indeed a scary prospect, we should do our best to make sure this does not happen, while understanding that nothing in life is promised to anyone. <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I’ve debated a lot of anarcho-libertarians and only the most hardcore partisan zealots, usually the most ignorant, would try and claim that what we have now is mob rule. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />A purely democratic system is synonymous with mob rule. I know that U.S.A is not a pure democracy, but it is close enough to democratic that it essentially is mob rule. But when mobs rule the real rulers are those who have mastered the art of mass manipulation. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ah yes, so says the zealot lecturing anyone else about intellectual honesty? ROTFL.<br />If you can’t understand that one group has the backing of the rest of society while the other does not then I’m not going to be able to convince you otherwise. If you’re literally too dense to recognize that you do have legal and criminal recourse against the outlaw group, maybe not in recovering your drugs, but in kidnapping and destruction of your property, then what can I say? Zealotry is what it is.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The outlaw DEA has not broken the government laws, any recourse against them will need to be provided by private industry. Please let me know when a D.E.A. offensive defense agency starts up, I would love to take the funding that I am currently forced to provide to the D.E.A. and instead provide it to them. I also am strongly in favor of death penalties to those who are guilty of armed home invasions leading to kidnappings and prolonged false imprisonments. <br />

				jpinkman - In my book, you loose an awful lot of credibility in this &#039;debate&#039; given your apparent need to conduct constant personal slurs and launch into demeaning personal attacks against kmfkewm.<br />Here is a SMALL percentage of the personal attacks you have come out with....<br /><br />- You really are clueless <br />- You sound like a drama queen.<br />- It’s amazing that anyone would use such a blindingly retarded analogy<br />- Well no shit sherlock<br />- you’re literally too dense to recognize<br />- I think you’re high.<br />- I have to ask whether you’re autistic<br />- Wow. It’s really amazing to me that anyone could be this thick. <br /><br />Additionally, unlike kmfkewm you have not provided any citations/links to backup any of your asserted &#039;facts&#039;.<br />You also seem decidedly naive as well as you appear to have been biased in some respects regarding what the anarchist ideal/paradigm actually encompasses whereas kmfkewm clearly has a very good grasp on the stated ideals of democracy and capitalism.<br /><br />I&#039;m not stating that you are entirely wrong, just that you appear to be arguing with an incomplete set of understandings of the merits/failings let alone the more subtle aspects of BOTH sides of the coin..

Also where are these citations that you seem to think kmf provided as I just don&#039;t see them? If you have an issue with the factual basis of anything I said, it helps to cite specifics rather than issue vague generalities that can&#039;t be confirmed or refuted. Unless of course your whole purpose was to make unanswerable accusations rooted in the biases of your libertarian anarchist sympathies; given how nebulous your charges seems more likely. If not then it&#039;s time to step up and bring it. <br /><br />Actually I think you missed the thrust of my primary criticism. I know kmf has a good grasp of capitalism, democracy, and anarcho-capitalist ideals and principles. My critique has mostly centered on the practical application of his ideology to the real world which I don&#039;t believe he&#039;s done a good or complete job of addressing that he&#039;s actually thought through such such issues. Although to be fair, given the handicap of trying to while frying on acid this is actually quite understandable. I personally would find such an exercise revolting if similarly incapacitated.<br /><br />Anyway, if you&#039;re reading this kmfkewm I&#039;m sure you know better than to take anything said in an online debate personally, but in case you did, please don&#039;t. AFAIC, whatever said in a heated debate should stay there. Arguing ideology will be every bit as vehement and combative as arguing religion. So really, I hope it slides off you as easily as it does me. Oh, and I&#039;ve meaning to say for a while, I&#039;m really sorry you found yourself doing that while tripping balls. :) I can&#039;t think of a more unappealing way to spend my time, well actually I can, but you get the point.<br /><br />
