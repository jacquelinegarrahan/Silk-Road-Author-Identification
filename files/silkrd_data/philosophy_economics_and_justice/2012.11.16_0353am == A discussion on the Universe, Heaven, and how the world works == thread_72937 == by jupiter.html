				Through my life experiences, I&#039;ve learned a lot about how thoughts manifest into reality, and through my use of drugs (LSD, Mushrooms, MDMA and smoking pot on a daily basis since I was 14) I&#039;ve come up with one or two theories on how the universe works. Since I first started using Silk Road I very quickly realized that there are many like-minded people around the world, many of which must have their own ideas and experiences to add to this thread and teach lessons to those who haven&#039;t been &quot;enlightened&quot; for lack of a better word. I&#039;m a bit tired so I plan on coming back to this thread and adding further to my post, but I&#039;d like to start off by recommending anyone to watch &quot;The Secret&quot;, a documentary that reaffirmed a lot of the beliefs I had about life and something I assume at least a few members of this forum have seen before. The woman who wrote the book and narrates the documentary sounds corny and it eventually becomes somewhat repetitive but it&#039;s basically just a compilation of interviews with philosophical intellectuals talking about &quot;the law of attraction&quot; and the universe. <br /><br />Till I edit this, Jupiter<br /><br />

				Typtap: I love you.&nbsp; You walk the line between hocus pocus and science with such brilliance that I&#039;m not sure whether you&#039;re full of it or absolutely brilliant.&nbsp; I think both, actually.&nbsp; But regardless, I simply had to say it.&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />If I could take issue with your first point though... possibility and nothingness.&nbsp; You speak of nothingness as a thing.&nbsp; As an entity.&nbsp; &quot;nothing has to exist for anything to be possible.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;re deliberately suggesting that nothing has an actual existence or if you&#039;re forgetting that nothing is, by definition, the lack of existence.&nbsp; It&#039;s nothing.&nbsp; Not a funny kind of something that can be morphed into other forms.<br /><br />I&#039;m also not sure what you mean by possibility.&nbsp; A possibility is simply an event with a non-zero chance of occurrence; by focusing on the concept of possibility itself I think you may be tacitly ascribing properties to it that it doesn&#039;t have.&nbsp; If there is truly nothing, then nothing is possible -- yet the probability that nothing will happen and nothing will change is 100%.&nbsp; Is that a possibility?&nbsp; I don&#039;t believe so, because it isn&#039;t an event.&nbsp; I&#039;m thinking it&#039;s a misapplication of the concept of possibility.<br /><br />Either way, please, never stay silent.&nbsp; Your mind and your thoughts are a beautiful thing :)

				The space, the nothing... the space... between is what is pure consciousness that envelopes the material universe and is most certainly &quot;something&quot;.... no-thing hahaha. I think the buddhists speak of the places between the breath. Uh oh... 2cb kickin in. <br /><br /><br />Basically all is total consciousness. We are individuations of IT. I am that, you are that, and all of THIS is THAT!<br /><br />Chems can have the effect of opening us up to the All. Divinity lies within each and every being. Sorry if this is now ranty :) <br /><br />But as far as &quot;us&quot; and the &quot;god&quot; and the &quot;univverse(s).... LIFE. Always was, Always will be. And with that, consciousness. In which we are forever a part of. Or All of it... whichever we decide at each opportunity to be, create all we can imagine thus yet. <br /><br />xo
