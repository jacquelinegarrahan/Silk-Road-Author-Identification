				Come on guys, last week we had ZERO replies to the assignment.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />I know there&#039;s more of you out there who care about this stuff, please don&#039;t be afraid to spill your hearts out about how you feel! There&#039;s no reason fear deep thinking. You may end up enjoying the mental stimulation more than you ever dreamed you could.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />This weeks assignment: Begin Part III: The Right. I know most of you who don&#039;t agree with our ideas will at least agree with our criticisms of the right-wing warmongers.&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Part III begins on page 209 and we will read until the bottom of page 258. <br /><br />Again that&#039;s pages 209-258 (224-273 pdf).<br /><br />For those just joining us, the book can be downloaded for free or purchased from the following link:<br /><br />https://mises.org/document/3861/The-Left-the-Right-and-the-State<br /><br /><br />“The real choice isn’t between liberty and security;<br />it is between our security and the state’s.”<br /><br />~Doc

				Please don&#039;t be discouraged due to the lack of replies. I see these threads and want to contribute so badly but honestly I am a student and right now I&#039;m at the part of the term where my essays are piling up and I am doing readings and writing stuff that I get graded on, it consumes a lot of time and I would rather be reading this. I will read this whole chapter and get back to this thread as soon as I finish my homework. I think this forum is the most import part of the silk road.

				Agreed. Appreciate the importance of getting a discussion going, but even if things are slow at the moment it is good for us to at least have a reading list to work through alongside other things we may be studying. Will try and contribute at some point if I can.

That&#039;s awesome the book has made you at least look at market solutions in a different light! Its admirable that your still sticking around, and I really think that we&#039;ll end up reading a book with arguments that are way more objective and convincing in a intellectually provoking manner. Something that mathematically breaks down the logical pros and cons. I know doc and the rest of us really are happy to see that people are still following along.&nbsp; ;D

				Yea, I&#039;ve been hearing from folks here and there that they are following along but don&#039;t have time to post (myself included).&nbsp; We&#039;ll do a movie night or something after this section and the election to ease the pace.

				What&#039;s up, Doc?<br /><br />I must admit I was surprised by &quot;The Reality of Red State Fascism&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;d thought one could generally lump those extolling the virtues of a free market all together on the right of the political spectrum, and never gave much thought to the &quot;Authoritarian vs. Libertarian&quot; dimension.&nbsp; The Right is less homogenous than I imagined!&nbsp; However, there are still fundamentals that pull them together, the strongest of which is the shared belief in the righteousness of free markets.&nbsp; As heartening as I find it to hear as esteemed a market proponent as Lew Rockwell throwing out the word &quot;Fascism&quot; to describe Bush II&#039;s reign, I remain as sceptical as ever of the markets ability to meet the needs of humanity.<br />I nostalgically enjoyed the descriptions of Clinton as left wing (a uniquely American perspective), and as&quot;some kind of unique moral evil despoiling the White House.&quot;!&nbsp; The hyperbole of the American political class remains unmatched in history.
