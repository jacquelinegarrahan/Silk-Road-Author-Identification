				This is always great advice even when not trippin on psychedelics.&nbsp; I have been taking daily walks in the evening now when the sun begins to set and the day is cooling off.&nbsp; Walking thru the neighborhood, watching kids play and the sky above always has a profound effect on me.&nbsp; It always changes my mood to a positive one, and I come back to my residence refreshed and relaxed.&nbsp; Does anyone here take regulars walks, even if you don&#039;t have too?&nbsp; You should try it!&nbsp; I&#039;m going on one right now to get lunch, peace!&nbsp; 8)

				On that note, I&#039;ve found that taking a long walk shortly after dropping is one of the best ways to kick off a home-based psychedelic trip. The focus on the substance kicking in dissipates from the distractions of what you encounter, and the high comes in subtly until you get back inside into your surroundings and realize to what degree you are high.<br /><br />&nbsp;::)

				Trip-starting on a walk in your neighbourhood is an amazing thing. I love the feeling of connection.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a morning person but being up for sunrises is pretty great. My focus is far more on the natural aspect, the earth turning, the stars fading, the plants getting their day&#039;s first taste of light - than the human aspect (probably because most everyone is sleeping).

				I live in a rural area and I walk down to the nearest crossroad every morning. I&#039;ve done this since I was a kid.<br /><br />Totally feel what you guys are saying. Also really love watching the sun come up at like 5AM this time of year, it&#039;s incredibly beautiful to watch the world come to life.

				I walk as well, often at night. It&#039;s not a lonely feeling, it&#039;s a positive alone feeling. I have yet to trip on a walk but I definitely aim to try it.<br /><br />Correction! I once walked with a friend around his neighborhood while on a light dose of shrooms. Was a wonderful night. Again, will be trying another trip on a walk, but by myself this time.<br /><br />Bike riding is also great if you&#039;re a fan of the traveling aspect of the walk (while sober of course). I like going places I don&#039;t usually because of being on a biking trail or what have you.
