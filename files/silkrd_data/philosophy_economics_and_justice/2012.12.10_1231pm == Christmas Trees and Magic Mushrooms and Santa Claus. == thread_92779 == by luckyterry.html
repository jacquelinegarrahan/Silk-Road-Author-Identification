				I&#039;d love to hear SR member&#039;s view on the links made between the traditions of Christmas trees with presents underneath and Father Christmas being linked to Northern European pagan practices of Amanita Muscaria Shrooms rituals. I&#039;d love for this to be true. <br /><br />http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2008/09/santa-claus-magic-mushroom.html<br /><br />Or here is an excerpt from the article at the link above. <br /><br /><br />“Although most people see Christmas as a Christian holiday, most of the symbols and icons we associate with Christmas celebrations are actually derived from the shamanistic traditions of the tribal peoples of pre-Christian Northern Europe. The sacred mushroom of these people was the red and white amanita muscaria mushroom … These peoples lived in dwellings made of birch and reindeer hide, called ‘yurts.’ Somewhat similar to a teepee, the yurt&#039;s central smoke hole is often also used as an entrance. After gathering the mushrooms from under the sacred trees where they appeared, the shamans would fill their sacks and return home. Climbing down the chimney-entrances, they would share out the mushroom&#039;s gifts with those within … Santa also dresses like a mushroom gatherer. When it was time to go out and harvest the magical mushrooms, the ancient shamans would dress much like Santa, wearing red and white fur-trimmed coats and long black boots.” -Dana Larsen, “The Psychedelic Secrets of Santa Claus” Cannabis Culture, Marijuana Magazine, Dec 18th, 2003<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I haven&#039;t heard of the Pharmacratic Inquisition before but I&#039;m familiar with Jan Irvin&#039;s work and his webdite at knosticmedia.com .. He&#039;s been on the Joe Rogan podcast a few times and comes out with some fascinating theories but blimey, that man has a boring voice.. <br /><br />I heard Dennis McKenna , Terrences brother, on a show this week referring to the likely link between the early Christian cults and psychedelics. Nothing would surprise me to be honest after reading Timothy Freke&#039;s &quot;Jesus Mystery&#039;s&quot;.

				The shamans noticed the phscedilic properties of the mushrooms, but many where far to poisonous to eat. The native reinder of the area where also fond of these mushrooms, the shamans noticed the reindeer did not get sick or poisoned from these toxic potent phsycedelic mushrooms because of their ridiculously good livers. <br /><br />They would get tripped out and of course dance, prance. They looked blitzed. Thus the reindeer names I guess. And the best part is the side effect of these mushrooms made the reinder sweat and their noses would itch from being wet and warm. They would rub them against the rough tree barks and would make their noses red raw. Glowing almost ;)<br /><br />Haha the funney bit is the shamans drinking filter phsycedelic reindeer piss to trip their visonary balls off and then deciples would drink their piss for an ongoing disgusting residual effect. <br /><br />The things people do to get high haha.
