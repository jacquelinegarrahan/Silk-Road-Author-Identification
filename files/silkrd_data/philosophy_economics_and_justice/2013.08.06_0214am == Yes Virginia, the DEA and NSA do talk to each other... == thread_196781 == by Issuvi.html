				At the risk of throwing a match into a magazine during an electrical storm, I have just been made aware of the following Reuters article:<br /><br />http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805<br /><br />So, apparently the NSA is funneling information from its domestic surveillance activities to the DEA, and this is being used to initiate criminal prosecutions already.<br /><br />This is only more worrying in light of the recent news about the javascript exploit in TorBrowser.<br /><br />Breaking open the benzos, anyone?<br /><br />-Issuvi

				The government&#039;s new strategy of brainwashing what should be an absolutely outraged, riotous public:&nbsp; &quot;this is not only legal, we do this every day, and we&#039;ve been doing it for years!&quot;<br /><br />For something that was supposed to be kept a secret, to go and make a statement like that... as if make it sound like &#039;it was only a secret because no one asked&#039;, or &#039;way to go, you blew our cover, now we can&#039;t get the bad guys!&#039; ...&nbsp; clearly damage control coming from spin city.&nbsp; They employed the same bullshit when the NSA leaks began.&nbsp; And threw in a few of lies to add insult to injury.

				Let&#039;s also be very honest about their purpose. <br /><br />Their purpose is not to exonerate people. This is a a one way street.<br /><br />http://blogs.findlaw.com/strategist/2013/06/brilliant-lawyer-requests-nsa-records-for-clients-robbery-alibi.html (http://blogs.findlaw.com/strategist/2013/06/brilliant-lawyer-requests-nsa-records-for-clients-robbery-alibi.html)<br /><br />Since the NSA only provides this information to Law Enforcement when they feel it&#039;s necessary -there is no balance. <br /><br />I know that people are going to object to my idea but here it is: if they can -they will cherry pick whom they want to persecute. Stay off of their radar by not excelling at anything or alternately -by excelling too much (the Koch brothers could drink brandy out of fresh human skulls from orphaned children and the FBI wouldn&#039;t give two shits.) But run a crowdsourced meeting place for drug users and they are just itching to frame somebody.<br /><br />

				I went through a couple of articles on this. One was saying how they will take information form surveillance, that was gathered on someone illegally and use it to arrest them for something. But, since they know their initial evidence is not admissible in court, they tell the local cops to pull someone over for a broken tail light or something and then come up with PC. <br /><br />Then they search your car and, oh shit, there are drugs in there. What a lucky find.
