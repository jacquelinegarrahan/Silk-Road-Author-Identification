				Of course no big surprise.&nbsp; This is what bothers me about my fellow Americans. They need to WAKE THE FUCK UP! It&#039;s obvious America relies on the illegal drug trade - I mean, it&#039;s not like whole government agencies would be unemployed or anything....

				Very significant as it shows yet another way the war on drugs is failing. If the DEA really wanted to cripple the cartels they would have already by ending prohibition, but they and the cartels are making such a profit its ridiculous. This just shows how little the DEA actually does to combat real crime, not because they dont want to necessarily but because as soon as they bust one cartel boss or member, there will always be someone to fill that person shoes as long as prohibition exists. Thanks for the read ST6, always enjoy your posts and discussions. Love and respect to you brother!

				Strange decision, looks political. No mention of the Los Zeta&#039;s, there has been a tectonic shift in the crime landscape since Quintero was imprisoned, kidnappings and torture, would be a blessing, compared to how the Zeta&#039;s deal with their enemies. Decapitation, then the corpse&nbsp; will be hung in town on display. Mass murders, brutal killings, are the norm there now. And to think Columbia was once revered as the drug death capital, they are made to look like mormons compared to these Zeta&#039;s. Imagine the sheer terror, seized in the middle of the night, bound gagged, blindfolded. Then a piece&nbsp; of timberwood, 3inches by 2 inches is brought down on the unsuspecting, soon to be dead victim&#039;s head.&nbsp; Then they are decapitated, with a large knife, I swear there is no sound on earth like the sound of knife cutting through bone. It makes your blood curdle. And these victims are just relatives of the intended. It&#039;s a very very dangerous place now Mexico. If you dare, these video&#039;s can be seen on Bestgore.com. But view with discretion, as they leave an indelible scar on your mind.

				The federal government will never end the drug war.&nbsp; It comes down to simple bureaucratic economics.&nbsp; SPEND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT.&nbsp; Because if you dont use it you might lose it.&nbsp; Just one of the many many reasons the drug war is inherently inefficient.&nbsp; <br /><br />IT MAKES NO SENSE.&nbsp; What would the social cost be of making drugs legal?&nbsp; I have no doubt it would be less than the social costs the government burdens society with by locking people away and not allowing them to function in society and hold jobs.&nbsp; By slapping drug crimes on their record so they can not get a job even if they have their freedom (this also increases public welfare spending).&nbsp; Then think about the social costs that are burden upon the children of fathers incarcerated WHO BECAUSE THEY ARE IN JAIL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR THEIR CHILDREN.&nbsp; <br /><br />Those are just some of the many social costs of the drug war but lets not forget the easily quantified costs of fighting a war against your own people for no other reason than expressing individual liberties by consuming a PRODUCT.&nbsp; It grinds my gears knowing the uncle same is stealing my money so they can funnel it to companies like the CCA that get huge tax breaks after profiting from modern day slavery.&nbsp; Over 30 grand a year for a prisoner with over half of fed inmates incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses is just nonsensical.&nbsp; The tens of billions of dollars we spend a year enforcing these laws of morality that should not exist in a society that our forefathers founded.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ridiculous.<br /><br />Anyways sorry for the rant but will Chapo whack this guy if he starts tryin to get back in if he indeed ever get out?&nbsp; Or is he a drug lord pensioner haha.

				It is unsustainable but so is the US economy.&nbsp; Its one giant bubble that why we print so much fuckin money.&nbsp; Its the lack of sustainability in &quot;micro&quot; programs like these that add to our card-house economy and eventually someones gonna knock the table.&nbsp; I am becoming less and less a fan of the usd and a huge detractor of the euro and all this business of a centralized economy.&nbsp; It creates disincentives towards acting rationally.&nbsp; Do you thing if Michigan was a sovereign state it would aste its money on drug enforcement.&nbsp; ashit some places cant even send emergency responders to burglaries but lets pump up the federal government with money that is created by some cunt at the banks just adding numbers into a computer.&nbsp; ITS NOT REAL.&nbsp; Fiat currency has one outcome dictatorship or another form of authoritarianism.&nbsp; Rome, France and soon to be the US.&nbsp; Tocqueville would hang himself if he lived to see today&#039;s Democracy in America.
