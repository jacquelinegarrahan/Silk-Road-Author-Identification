				When you talk to people who remember the Kennedy assassination most of the time you hear &quot;I remember where I was when I heard the news&quot; and I noticed that generally people say the same thing about 9/11. I was talking about this in general the other day with someone and their point of view was that &quot;9/11 was this version of JFK assassination&quot; and I couldn&#039;t decide if I agreed. <br /><br />Discuss?&nbsp;

				I think two thing on this subject, <br />One if it was a bonified attack masterminded by bin laden and&nbsp; AL-Qaeda then you have to give them credit for pulling off one hell of an attack, tactically they out smarted the CIA, FBI, NSA and all the other abbreviations, if you remove yourself from the human tragedy element then it was a brilliant move that weakened American economics, faith and it citizens own trust in its country and terrified the entire western world, it may not have been the most subtle but they got there point across.<br /><br />Two, if the government engendered this attack to create fear, hostility and start a war then this was also another tactically genius move, what could be better than turning a whole continent against a religion, every red blooded American watching each other closely, assessing there potential threat from there neighbor,&nbsp; they got blank check for funding, arms sales shot up, bills that allowed the government unprecedented access into its citizens lives were rushed through on a tilde wave of security updates that were largely unchecked and so vague they left lots of room for interpretation.<br />If this is the case, again the goal was complete.<br /><br />*Disclaimer*<br />I in no way support the actions of ether the terrorists or the government during this time, its just my two cents, i find all attacks on civilians despicable ether through acts of terrorism or conventional warfare.

				I think they are very similar as far as impact goes. They also have huge conspiracy theories behind them with a lot of people believing there to be cover ups and government involvement.<br /><br />I do think that 9/11 had an impact that is way more widespread and serious than the Kennedy assassination. We are still over in the Middle East from the 9/11 attacks. After the attacks it didn&#039;t stop destroying lives, we have thousands of service men and women dead and wounded and even more poor Arab children and families dead and wounded.

				Lets not forget history here.&nbsp; Kennedy was just one man.&nbsp; President sure, but someone wanted him out of the way.&nbsp; As for 9/11 i cannot stand it when people accuse american agencies being responsible.<br />I dont mean any offense to americans here today but i honestly believe that the majority of the american public just cannot accept the fact that an attack that damaging and widespread occurred on their soil.<br />Even if you say to me &quot;yeah but it was an excuse to start a war on terror&quot;<br />I would say, bullshit and IRA.<br />If it was a set up or an inside job to give them the directorate to obliterate all terrorism, then why they fuck didnt the american government do something about the IRA or troubles in Norther Ireland in general the very next day.<br />The simple answers are that the IRA has american sympathisers and people who to this day send them cash and hold fund raising events for them.<br />Dont want to listen or believe me?&nbsp; Just ask the average american and they will tell you that somewhere along the line they are of Irish decent, which is probably true.<br />The point is, the american government simply wouldnt care that much about one group of peoples troubles to plan a massive attack like that on their own country.&nbsp; And, dare i say this without causing another argument, are too stupid to pull it off anyway.<br />No instead they just wanted revenge, plain and simple.&nbsp; Why most of the world cant just accept this is just fucking beyond me.<br />I hope no americans were insulted during the making of this movie !

				We aren&#039;t going to bomb the hell out of Ireland because the whole European Union would not support it and be outraged starting a war with them.<br /><br />We did know about September 11 before it happened and even knew that these hijackers were here, but didn&#039;t do anything about it. That is a fact that the government admits. The information just didn&#039;t ever link together from the CIA to FBI they say. I doubt that.<br /><br />I do think we let it happen to use as an excuse for more Federal power to be granted and have American support of doing so stripping away our liberties, but doing it in a way where the public wants them stripped away. Getting into a war to dominate the Arab world with our military presence while getting support or at least a nod from our allies too.<br /><br />This attack wasn&#039;t very secret and the CIA and FBI knew that they planned to hijack planes and run them into buildings.

				Perhaps JFK was a stepping stone to see if they (global empire?) were able to get away with 9/11? .. who knows really, so many sides of the story, so much disinformation and misinformation...but<br /><br />The fact that the buildings were hit 2/3rds of the way up... yet after fire for an hour were able to somehow crush the bottom 2/3rds into dust at almost free fall speed?&nbsp; Seems too much like a movie to me.. and that&#039;s that thing with unrealistic movies.. our perception of physics and the way the world actually works is out of wack...<br /><br />Building 7 (WTC7) is something else I look at and am like wtf.. No plane hit that building, yet it collapsed into its own footprint from fire on a couple floors..<br /><br />I have no idea what happened on Sept 11th.. but I do know that the government isn&#039;t telling us the truth about what went down.. that in itself creates mystery and rumors... and they most likely know this..

				It&#039;s definitely possible that the government was involved with or at least allowed the attacks to happen, but the conspiracy goes too far when you start nitpicking about the way in which the towers collapsed. Planes and fires DO cause towers to collapse. There are also some decent documentaries about the reasons that all three towers collapsed but people don&#039;t pay as much attention to those. Government didn&#039;t plant bombs on the towers to make sure they collapsed. We still could have invaded Iraq from the plane crashes alone without any collapse.

				I agree totally.<br />The american government doesnt NEED to be held back by all that red tape bollocks.<br />Thats why Bush AND Blair went into that country together.&nbsp; The brits couldnt do it alone because we ARE terribly british about things like that.<br />But whoever persuaded who, they both went into iraq for the oil.<br />They just needed a push or an excuse to do it.<br />I am not saying that 9/11 wasnt an atrocity, of course it was.&nbsp; But i guarantee you now that there were people in the Bush administration, even Bush himself, who couldnt give a flying fuck about the average human being.<br />For starters, Bush didnt know what the fuck to do when he got told the news at that elimentry school.<br />I wonder how much &quot;&quot;persuasion&quot; he needed to go to full scale war.<br />Sorry if it seems i am rambling, but Bush and Blair were the two biggest mistakes of the western world.<br />And hey, im a westerner.

				There&#039;s a Nova documentary called &quot;Why the towers fell&quot; and that&#039;s what it covers. The first one I ever saw was a history channel documentary called &quot;Zero hour&quot; or something, it covers a lot of interviews about 9/11 but is interspersed with segments about what caused the towers to fall. These are both available on youtube and will probably lead to others.<br />It basically comes down to the extreme damage of the crash, which also destroyed fireproofing, and the extremely hot temperature that jet fuel burns at. It wasn&#039;t just a building that caught on fire, it got hit by a fucking jet plane. These points are still arguable, but it makes enough sense to me. Most engineers and architects will tell you that the towers fell on their own without the help of a controlled demolition, and if anyone is the expert on this matter it would be them.<br />I&#039;m not arguing that the government didn&#039;t have anything to do with it, just that they didn&#039;t need to go through the risk of detonating the towers as well as crashing planes into them. And if the government was responsible for 9/11 then who cares if there were bombs involved, it&#039;s really a moot point in the scheme of things.

				not a fan of bush but incorrect. He had his IQ tested at 125+ which isnt genius but is fairly intelligent (although i agree the most powerful man in the world should be waaaaaay above average intelligence). The problem bush had was a problem with communicating that made him seem alot less intelligent then he really was. I can sympathize with this seeming ive known many people over the years with this exact same problem. If you spend abit of time and get past their exterior barrier they have up for whatever reason, you will find there alot more thoughtful and calculated then the general loudmouths who tend to take up most of the time society generates to listening.

				If you look and listen to george bush&#039;s speeches while he was governor, he was a really good and competent&nbsp; speaker. <br /><br /><br />Pre-senial dementia was thought to be the case but honestly what I conclude is he was just playing his cards the way he was told to.&nbsp; Being dumb on purpose, as to not seem deliberately evil or bad. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;
