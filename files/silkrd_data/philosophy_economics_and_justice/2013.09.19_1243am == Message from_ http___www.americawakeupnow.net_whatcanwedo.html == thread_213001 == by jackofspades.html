				SO, WHAT CAN WE DO?<br />&nbsp;<br />When confronted with the information you have just read, nearly every person utters in stunned disbelief &quot;So, what can we do?&quot;&nbsp; Followed by, &quot;We can&#039;t do anything about this.&quot;&nbsp; It may seem to be a daunting and nearly impossible task to take these issues head on.&nbsp; What the American people need not to lose sight of is, that individually we don&#039;t stand a chance.&nbsp; This will not be an army of one!&nbsp; Collectively, we are by far the VAST MAJORITY!&nbsp; This will be the mentality that we Americans are going to have to employ, in order to fight these immense problems that face our nation!<br />&nbsp;<br />Americans have been cleverly and purposely separated and divided.&nbsp; We are separated by race, religion, gender, political affiliation, sports team worship, etc.&nbsp; You name it and it&#039;s been used to separate and divide us!&nbsp; A HOUSE DIVIDED CAN NOT STAND!&nbsp; Those who control our government know human nature very well.&nbsp; When hard working Americans watch how our hard earned tax dollars are being spent on a welfare state that is out of control; the natural response is to take out our frustrations on the people receiving the hand outs!&nbsp; Now, let&#039;s all be true to ourselves, if you were offered a free lunch, would you decline it?&nbsp; We know that nothing in this world is free.&nbsp; The price we all pay for this welfare state, can not only be measured in dollars, but is truly measured in frustrated racial divisions!&nbsp; Those who rule have gotten their ways by dividing us in these manners.&nbsp; Religious division is practiced across the world by the majority of organized religions.&nbsp; How many people have died for their religious convictions throughout the millennia?&nbsp; What purpose do religious wars serve?&nbsp; None of these organized religions have produced their gods!&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with religious faith, but religious fanaticism is what those in control seek!&nbsp; Gender bending has been going on forever!&nbsp; This fight will require that all American men and women be on board!&nbsp; As far as political affiliation, we put no stock in this corrupt two party system.&nbsp; When was the last time a Republican or Democratic president truly did right by the American people?<br />&nbsp;<br />We have talked about starting a GRASSROOTS movement, maybe a new party?&nbsp; But, we fear that in the corrupted state of our union, trying to start a new party by their rules would be next to impossible.&nbsp; Those in power have crushed all newcomers without breaking a sweat!&nbsp; When you have to abide by corrupted rules, it becomes an impossible task!<br />&nbsp;<br />So you ask, what can we do?&nbsp; What we propose is to start to rally Americans across our country!&nbsp; Start chapters in each major city and spread out from there.&nbsp; We are looking to achieve critical mass!&nbsp; We need a massive majority of Americans on the same page.&nbsp; And what we mean by on the same page is that everyone needs to be educated and aware of the atrocities that have been perpetrated against our people and our country!&nbsp; The information given to you on this web page is only the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; There is much more corruption to be uncovered!&nbsp; Transformation needs to start from the top down!&nbsp; Those controlling our politicians need to be revealed and dealt with!<br />&nbsp;<br />We need to take back control of our currency immediately!&nbsp; The last time an American president did this, was when President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order #11110.&nbsp; This order sent our minting presses into a 24/7 mode printing silver certificate dollars.&nbsp; If you remember, in 1963, two and five dollar bills were being minted with a red stamp and silver certificate redemption on the bill.&nbsp; This lasted for about five months, and then President Kennedy was assassinated.&nbsp; The mints were ordered to stop printing silver certificate dollars.&nbsp; We find the assassination of this president a curious coincidence.&nbsp; President Kennedy knew that if he could flood our economy with dollars that were backed by silver, the Federal Reserve notes would be rendered useless.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve note never had any intrinsic value to it; a note backed by nothing may as well be green toilet paper!&nbsp; These elites were not going to stand down and watch America, their financial golden goose slip through their hands!&nbsp; Although Executive Order #11110 was used to try to bring down the Federal Reserve in 1963, we need to have a leader that would use his exectutive powers to once again try to take back control of our currency and implement a similar order!!!<br />&nbsp;<br />AMERICANS NEED TO STOP BEING COMPLACENT!&nbsp; Complacency is what got us into this mess to begin with!&nbsp; Even the Roman emperors knew that the only way to stay in power was to keep the masses thinking that they had everything that they needed and were happy!&nbsp; Those in control have been playing this game perfectly!&nbsp; Gandhi knew that if he could get a billion of his people moving as one, that the strangle hold of the British Empire would be broken!&nbsp; Are we Americans truly happy?&nbsp; Working like slaves to make tax payments, mortgage payments, car payments, and paying ridiculous compounded interest rates on these loans back to the corrupt banking elites!<br />&nbsp;<br />We speak to many, many fellow Americans, and the vast majority are stressed out, tired, overworked, not at all happy, and questioning the quality of their lives!<br />&nbsp;<br />WE ASK YOU, IS THIS THE TRUE AMERICAN DREAM?&nbsp; WE SAY NO, IT IS NOT!&nbsp; WE ARE TIRED OF BEING TREATED LIKE SLAVES!&nbsp; WE ARE NOT SHEEP AND WILL NO LONGER CONFORM TO THE WILL OF THESE ELITIST THUGS!<br />&nbsp;<br />WE ASK ALL WHO HAVE READ THIS TO PASS IT ON AND BY ALL MEANS, MAKE CONTACT WITH US!&nbsp; WE NEED AMERICANS TO STAND WITH US AS ONE!<br /><br /><br />Clearnet: http://www.americawakeupnow.net/thestateoftheunion.html<br /><br />

				If you think the monopoly on using voilence and force (governments) is possible to make a good thing out of just by voting on the right person who wants <br />that monopoly, then your missing the point since there can never be a normal person who wants the power of a monopoly like that.<br /><br />Its kinda like the soldiers going to war to create peace, they think that if they just kill the right people then there&nbsp; will be peace.<br /><br />And they think they can vote on the right people to create peace thru the monopoly on using force and voilence. Its a nobrainer.<br /><br /><br />A website will not do it either since most people watch tv and the onlinepeople aint even searchin for truths most of them.<br /><br />When the onlinepeople get a uncontrollable currency and a anonymous was to collect donations to send letters to the <br />tv-watchers homes, then we would have a real change since everyone would recieve a letter if that was the goal of it..<br /><br />Until then lets watch the tv-watchers believe they can vote for the right psycopaths in the democracy and that you can <br />create peace by going to war. =(

Likewise, a group of players are in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can, taking into account the decisions of the others.&quot;<br /><br />In other words, I believe the heart of the issue at hand is that governing forces in today&#039;s society are often established with the intent of either helping the individual or the group as a whole, and often end up helping nobody at all.&nbsp; Look at a lot of the disillusionment among many politicians, police, teachers, ect who got into their line of work with what probably started out as the best intentions, and now, they realize it&#039;s impossible to do any good from within a system that is supposed to serve one and all, and all too often serves only those within-if even then.&nbsp; I mean, we often look at cops, politicians, &quot;the man&quot; as some &quot;other&quot;, but in reality, they&#039;re fallible people like anyone else who get wrapped up in these really unnatural social constructs that are flat out worshiped by society.&nbsp; This starts to get further into economic theory, but I think there are a lot of potential answers in &quot;self-governance&quot; theory.&nbsp; I think that there are totally other ways we can be living with each other here that aren&#039;t popularly considered.

				I would say there are 2 kinds of peoples tho, one is parasite and one is not..<br /><br />The parasites &quot;know&quot; they only have one life and that there is no higher powers and nothing like karma, so they live their lifes collecting money to be able to consume more and more things, they are stuck in this material dimension and they believe objects are what life is all about.. Theese are the ones destroying the homeplanet that will make them die since they aint living in harmony with nature and you can never do that forever since when to much nature has been turned into piles of garbage then its game over.<br /><br />And the other smaller part of humanity knows about karma and higher powers, and that no designs can evolve from nothing since only a intelligent mind can create designs like we see in nature for example or in DNA.. And they are able to detach from all the things that destroy their homeplanet since they know what it will lead to.<br /><br />One BIg uncouncious group of humanity and one smal concious group of humanity.<br /><br />You cant say that all humans destroy nature and the homeplanet since some people know we are induvidually responsible for everything we do, some people just know that from deep inside their souls, and most people dont give a fuk since they cant make any money/slavetool by caring about their feelings and themselves enough to detch from everything that will kill the planet and themselves.<br /><br />So there is really 2 parts of humanity, you choose your own way if you wanna be a part of the destruction or the future, but big changes are already happening and it cant be stopped even if we wanted it to stop, and there will always be 2 parts of humanity, even tho we want it to be one part but it will never be.<br /><br />You cant say Im a part of the destruction of our homeplanet when I detach from everything that destroys nature, I even skipped out on getting a drivers license 10 years ago because that oil is not specially good for us al to burn, specially when all the carmanufacturers got hydrogen and electrical cars avallible for massproduction, when the world is ready.. Said BMW in their commercial of their hydrogen model. <br /><br />The world will never be ready for that until SR and BTC was used to inform everybody in the world about the existance of hydrogen and electrical cars, just because media will never tell the people about the existance of hydrogen BMW models for example.<br /><br />Im just jokin about the last part folk I know wewill not be using BTC and SR to send letters to all homes in the world telling them about the existane of hydrogencars, that would make people able to drive a car for free as long as they had seawater with them, and without destroying our homeplanet..<br /><br />We would not want to drive cars for free come on, then the poor people would not be poor anymore, we cant have that.. Let the rich be richer and the poorer become poorer, lets send some drugs using BTC and Sr.<br /><br />Peace
