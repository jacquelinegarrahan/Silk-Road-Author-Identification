				I found an article that says the US will auction off marijuana that was seized in raids that was previously legal for medical purposes in certain states.<br />This is effectively stealing! So the Government seizes cannabis because it is against federal law to sell cannabis. <br />Then when they are desperate for money, they sell the seized marijuana.<br /><br />IMO this is the height of Government abuse of power. How can they seize weed because it&#039;s illegal and then sell it to get funds desperately? <br />http://nationalreport.net/obama-auctioning-marijuana-seized-drug-raids-since-2008/

				I saw this too. It&#039;s amazing what the governement can get away with, but when will Americans stop bending over and taking it? Like seriously, ppl need to start rioting and protesting harrrdcore. Hopefully it happens soon because how THE FUCK is Obamma going to sell and illegal substance? Sure, weeds legal in certain states, but not on the national level. Technically Obama is breaking the law by even holding bud. WTF is wrong this America. <br /><br />PPl stand up! All it takes it 1 person, and hopefully ppl would follow in a revolution. We should revolt and demand a more transparent government.

				The government can and regularly does seize anything and everything related to the War on Drugs. If they can seize a house or a car and sell it then why not the actual drugs too? This is no different from the Soviet Union trading things on a state level that was forbidden by its citizens. Funny how the free market finds its way into the least likely of places. Too bad they had to take it with deadly force first in order to trade it. A perfect example of how the government can&#039;t create. It can only redistribute or destroy.

				The age old British common law principle of the presumption of innocence is also the very definition of legal. But that doesn&#039;t stop these thugs stealing from people accused and charged of nothing. You&#039;re guilty until proven innocent. And the 5th Amendment.... what&#039;s that?&nbsp; :o<br /><br />So this really has nothing to do with legality at this point. They have guns. They have &quot;authority&quot;. They take what they want. That&#039;s it.

				lol! ;D<br /><br />I never even read the article until you made your post about it being a satire. The whole site is a satire! That&#039;s some funny shit!!!<br /><br />Anyway I don&#039;t take back any of what I said. I see real news items every day that I think deserve to be in The Onion or on the National Report site. But they&#039;re not satires. They&#039;re real. I wouldn&#039;t be at all surprised if the Feds started selling weed to various state governments in the future to raise money. Sounds like a complete joke right now but oppressive government is capable of just about anything.

				There was a documentary on Netflix about police units who are not funded by local or federal governments, but only by seizures from drug related busts. It shows real examples of LE seizing houses, drugs, cars of former drug dealers and setting up their own drug ring to bust customers and local civilians (usually poor, homeless and bottom class individuals) looking for their fix.

				From what we understand... this is not a &quot;legitimate article&quot; from a &quot;valid news site/circle&quot;. We could be completely wrong and our sources could be incorrect.. but it seems to be from a not so &quot;serious&quot; news site.<br />Basically &quot;the Onion&quot; Haha.. :)<br />We wouldn&#039;t put it passed our government though.. so always be on guard.
