				Um... if everyone makes their transaction amounts with the same frequency and the same denomination: say 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 BTC, then it will be as untraceable as cash.... How can repetitive patterns of exchanges through privately owned mining operations--the same miners that are heavily involve in Tor, anonymity, and Silk Road--be sorted out for legal purposes? <br /><br />This is simply another option in a sea of probability.

				That&#039;s mostly the idea. You can only prove something in any transaction if you have proof of identity of both the sender and recipient; being able to effectively anonymously control bitcoin wallets makes them so easily evade-able at the moment. Like cash changing hands, only in the direct transaction is there any visibility, and even then it can be masked by tumblers / laundering techniques.

				If your identity is known at the exchange, then it doesn&#039;t matter what denominations you send the coins in, they can be linked to you.<br /><br />Zerocoin looks very promising, because<br /><br />1. It offers true anonymity by design, where it is possible for you to be the only person in the world who knows that 2 txns / coins are linked. Current mixing services offer security by policy, where they promise to delete the accounting details linking coins going in and coins coming out of their wallets.<br /><br />2. It will be cheap. Currently, anonymizing coins can take anywhere from 1.5% to over 10% in overhead fees. Presumably, because Zerocoin transactions are larger than normal Bitcoin transactions, miners will demand a higher fee, but it might be something like .005 BTC instead of the standard .0005 BTC. So you will be able to anonymize any amount of money for 50 cents.<br /><br />For a detailed explanation of Zerocoin, see this thread: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=152682.msg1057894#msg1057894<br />

A verified account at Mt. Gox, for example sends out a specified sum of coins to another hash address, a few times... and each time, a new and random hash is created for each new transaction... At a glance, this seems like an accounting nightmare, not worth pursuing...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: joe schmoe</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I sent them to a charity.
