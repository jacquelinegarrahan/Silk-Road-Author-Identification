				Why philosophy students do the most drugs<br /><br />Nearly 90% of them have taken drugs, a higher proportion than in any other discipline, according to a poll of 21 UK universities<br /><br /><br /><br />An Oxford philosopher this week described their drug experiences in a survey by online student newspaper the Tab. &quot;Having dinner with parents while seeing the world in monochrome and feeling supremely dizzy! I think my speech was barely coherent.&quot;<br /><br />Yawn. Other drug experiences recounted to the Tab are more entertaining. The Nottingham classicist who ran 4km home in 3D glasses while off their nut on illicit pharmaceuticals. The Oxford maths student who took MDMA, ketamine and laughing gas: &quot;I thought I was Godzilla.&quot;<br /><br />The Tab&#039;s survey of more than 5,000 students at 21 British universities reveals that 87% of philosophers polled had taken drugs, compared with 57% of medical students. Why this discrepancy? Is it because philosophy is easier than medicine and thus offers more recreational downtime? Really? Is grasping the Kantian noumenon less demanding than dissecting corpses?<br /><br />The Tab&#039;s editors, sensibly, say the survey should be taken with a pinch of salt since respondents are self-selecting. But if so, why would philosophy students be more likely to self-select than others? Is it – and this is just a theory – that relative employment prospects drive philosophers to seek solace in drugs? If so, why would a higher proportion of business administration students than lawyers claim to be drug users?<br /><br />Another theory is that philosophy – more than any other intellectual discipline (with the possible exception of a level three plumbing NVQ) – requires one to recalibrate the portals of one&#039;s consciousness in order to get one&#039;s intellectual freak on. In Thomas Nagel&#039;s superb essay What is it Like to be a Bat?, for instance, the great philosopher wrote: &quot;I want to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat. Yet if I try to imagine this, I am restricted to the resources of my own mind, and those resources are inadequate to the task.&quot;<br /><br />Nagel didn&#039;t think to take drugs to expand those resources, but other philosophers have done. William James took nitrous oxide and found, as he reported in The Varieties of Religious Experience, that it served to &quot;stimulate the mystical consciousness to an extraordinary degree&quot;. It was only then he understood Hegelian philosophy&#039;s notion of god: &quot;[T]o me the living sense of its reality only comes in the artificial mystic states of mind.&quot;<br /><br />Perhaps James&#039;s drug experimenting is inspiring today&#039;s philosophers: 45% of students polled claimed to have taken laughing gas. Or perhaps not – 68% had taken cannabis. Until a cross-referencing of which types of students favour what kind of drugs, we are lost in a world of diverting speculation.<br /><br />In ancient Greece and Rome, there was a drug called the tetrapharmakos, consisting of wax, pork fat, pitch and pine resin. Yummy. Hadrian considered it a delicacy and, possibly, commissioned a wall while under its influence. I mention it because Hellenistic philosopher Epicurus used tetrapharmakos to designate the four-part means of leading the happiest possible life. Clearly, too few of today&#039;s philosophers read Epicurus. Forget druggie hedonism, he counselled, the cure for what ails you is intellectual, not mystical: don&#039;t fear God, don&#039;t worry about death, what is good is easy to get, what is terrible is easy to endure.<br /><br />With this cure, Epicurus recommended, one might achieve ataraxia – freedom from worry and distress. Good point. But if you want to understand Hegel or know what it&#039;s like to be a bat or Godzilla, try laughing gas.<br /><br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/shortcuts/2013/may/22/why-philosophy-students-do-most-drugs

				I think philosophy demands that you explore realms that others have not explored. You ask questions others haven&#039;t asked. You look to experience things others haven&#039;t experienced. And since we are limited by how much of our brain and intellect we can use consciously, drugs are a gateway that lead to you using your brain a lot more

				So many potential answers. To the philosophy student, arguments from authority mean nothing. The nature of everything is in question. Drug use combines the tempting explore-the-universe-from-your-armchair perspective of the Rationalist, while embracing the proof-in-the-pudding demands of the Empiricist. They are the original scientists, and the only subject they can truly know is their own mind.<br /><br />I wonder if psych students come in second for similar reasons?

				I understand this is a mock article and so there really is no definite answers.<br /><br />Philosophy students are rather sensible about their drug use. They definitely have tried a higher number of drugs than other disciplines but do not necessarily abuse them more. From experience medicine, nursing and pharmacy students do alcohol way more frequently and harder than others. Philosophy do more psychedelics i.e. cannabis, shrooms and lsd. This isn&#039;t to say there isn&#039;t an overlap because a med student could hang out with a group of philosophy students, and vice versa.<br /><br />I would think philosophy/science students want to gain insight into the topics they study, i.e. the noumena &quot;things in themselves&quot; of Kant by decomposing their usual cognitive apparatus and trade it with an alternative look at the world. This is literally applying what they study in theory to the real world. Throughout history philosophers have found a lot of answers in doing drugs.<br /><br />Look at Francis Crick who discovered DNA while on acid, or Freud who developed psychoanalysis and was a coke fiend. When we devote our time to something we gain great insight into it during moments when we least expect it. Either we take drugs because we want to gain this insight, or we take drugs and it happens to be a moment of insight. <br /><br />Philosophy is by far the deepest and most through provoking science there is. It is no surprise that people turn to substances to seek solace when they discover that there is no absolute truth, or whatever. I had a friend who took a module of philosophy and he became an alcoholic for a while. Then again I have plenty of long term philosophy friends who are very sensible about their drug use and will rarely take anything other than cannabis (not even alcohol). Each to their own I suppose.

				I honestly believe it is because they tend to be the most intelligent group of any major on any campus and from everything I&#039;ve read and experienced, the more intelligent a person is, the more they seek novel experiences. I&#039;ve read numerous posts about majors broken down by average IQ and philosophy majors outranked engineers, mathematicians and physicist majors in almost every ranking I&#039;ve seen. Or, if they weren&#039;t at the top, they were very close to it.<br /><br />Interesting side note, I had a philosophy class recently and the teacher taught in Iowa for a while. He was chatting with a group of us before class once and talked about poor attendance in one particular class he taught up there. One day he asked that class why the attendance was so consistently low. He jokingly asked &quot;Where are all your classmates, smoking meth?&quot;<br /><br />He said the entire class somberly nodded, almost in unison, with one student saying very matter-of-factly &quot;Yeah.&quot;

				How about philosophers taking more drugs than others because they are more curious than other people ? <br /><br />Anyway, in my university, my fellow philosophy students do not seem to be so keen on drugs...many seem to value their brain so much that they won&#039;t even smoke a joint in fear of losing neurons.&nbsp; <br /><br />
