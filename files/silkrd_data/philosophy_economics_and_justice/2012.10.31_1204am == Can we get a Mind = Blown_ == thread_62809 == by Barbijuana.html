				Looking for some of you psychonauts to get in here and share some short little nuggets of synaptic firing that has produced a &quot;whoa fuck&quot; -- Sadly, some of these thoughts are so complex and beautiful that the creation of Language has prevented us from explaining, sharing or even conceptualizing these farts of wisdom.<br /><br />How would you describe the color Red without first creating the word Red.<br /><br />Your Brain is the only organ in the human body that named itself. <br />

				I fucking hate when I&#039;m tripping and i have this wave of insight flash over me briefly thoughts come together and all is figured out.&nbsp; Then 5 minutes later you can&#039;t even remember the thought you were having sometimes.&nbsp; This is why it&#039;s hard to capture those and bring them back.&nbsp; Have a notepad handy for truly insightful tripping.

				lol I am in the same boat when it comes to remembering ... <br /><br />Those moments when you feel that you TRULY understand what infinity is ... or you see music as a living organism ... those are a couple examples that I just really can&#039;t put into words.&nbsp; <br /><br />Loops are horrible ... I used to do a LOT of acid and when I grew shrooms I did them WAY too much also ... anyway I&#039;ve only had 1 bad trip in my life and it was after doing 7 hits of liquid ... so it starts off okay and all and then we get lost in the middle of a national forest (US) without water or flashlights or anything and start tripping our balls off ... anyway at one point I ask him what time it is (like he can actually read the moving hands on his watch, lol) and he says &quot;I think it&#039;s 10:20&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, after that a whole lot of horrible shit happens . I was sliced up by wicked looking flying knives, I fell into huge spider webs and was getting my legs eaten off, a gigantic beam of electricity was holding me to the ground constantly shocking me, clowns (I have no fear of clowns, idk why they popped up) were trying to brand me with a red hot pole, and some other various shit happens.&nbsp; Well, when things start o calm down I ask my friend &quot;what time is it&quot; and he says &quot;I think it&#039;s 10:20&quot;.&nbsp; And the loops starts again and had to have occurred at least five times.&nbsp; The loop ends with my friend and I floating looking at our sleeping bodies from above them ... we still remember the conversation we had and BOTH of us remember seeing the other from above almost like an out of body experience.<br /><br />That was the last time I did acid.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry I went off on rant there and didn&#039;t really stick to the subject, but I hope it provides some sort of entertainment :)

				I drank half a vile (roughly 50 strong hits) once and tripped hard for about 2 days or so it seemed, couldn&#039;t really keep track of time (thank goodness for good friends).&nbsp; But between that and the times I&#039;ve had much smaller doses I always have a &#039;moment of clarity&#039; as it&#039;s called during the trip.&nbsp; Everything just seems right and every thought makes sense instantaneously with the thought process that&#039;s firing off.&nbsp; I&#039;ve seen where hippies are born, man.<br /><br />Truly a beautiful thing, I appreciate those moments so much I don&#039;t even feel the need to trip anymore...but still do on occasion :)&nbsp; First post pretty much sums it up with the lack of words to describe the feeling.<br /><br />Had a couple bad ones along the way, no details on those but I just considered them the result of being insecure with my surroundings at the time and place.&nbsp; Good environments make for great trips.<br /><br />

				I took 3.5g of homegrown amazonians and some amount of purified DXM, 140+mg MDMA and inhaled nitrous throughout. At some point I was lying on my bed with a chick I liked a lot and she started telling me about how she&#039;s schizophrenic and went to rehab for meth, crack and heroin, that she was eventually going to fuck my whole world up because even though it was great now, she was going to fuck up everything. I experienced the most chest-tightening suffocating earth-shattering panic and anxiety, so much so that I thought I was dying from irregular heartrate or something similar. I just layed there listening to everything and I pretty much peaked on the drugs and fear/anxiety, so much so that everything washed over me with euphoria and I didn&#039;t care.<br /><br />That relationship ended horribly, but it was a good experience.

				The only thing I can share in comparison to that is...<br /><br />The very first time I tried 2ce was was a Sunday in Summer. We were at a friends house and me, my brother and my cousin had flights booked to Turkey via Abu Dhabi. We had about 6 hours before we had to go to the air port and we decided to take some acid followed by a couple of dosages of 2ce a bit later. <br /><br />What then proceeded was insanity. Navigating through the international airport and through customs to board an Arabic airline to Abu Dhabi. Experiencing take off in a lump of metal then successfully passing out 3 hours into a 14 hour flight and waking up as we landed on the other side of the world.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Probs the best trip of my life.
