				Please go easy on me and not flame, but I&#039;d genuinely like to know: Why are psilocybin shrooms so expensive on SR? $70 for a quarter? $500 for 4oz?? Locally and as far as I can remember, at the worst you would see it priced the same as weed. $25/quarter $50/half oz, $80 to $100 for an Oz. Usually it was way cheaper. Some things on SR are inherently priced due to their scarcity for some people to find locally, and priced according to how &#039;hard&#039; it is for a dealer to make/acquire it for distribution. I understand that. Supply and demand, and supply cost, respectively.<br /><br />I have personally had a closet with a few cakes in the past. Once you have the spores and get the grow rolling along, you produce them like CRAZY. I didn&#039;t have ridiculous grow operation going on, but I often found myself with more than I and my group of friends could eat. I have seen people literally fill garbage bags in no time with a monotub. <br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;m out of place. I was just smoking, browsing, and thinking too hard. No bad vibes, I promise :)<br /><br />(Also if someone&#039;s going to respond that I should grow and vend and make it affordable, well I have considered that. I work a 14/day job sadly and it&#039;s not the best weather for growing and I&#039;m strapped for time. But I&#039;m getting some spores and going to start a buildup for next spring for at least personal use. If I get it going along well, I&#039;m not beyond vending, though it&#039;s pretty intimidating. Tentative.)<br /><br /><br />I hope everyone is having a good day/evening/morning/night.<br />-Ph

				It&#039;s a lot easier than people realize, just have to remember to maintain that sterile environment. The smallest specimen can infiltrate your cakes and ruin it all. <br /><br />Check torrents, there is one in particular torrent that is a very detailed growing video guide. Highly regarded on shroomery, thought they get pissed when you pirate it because they want you to support the guy or whatnot.<br /><br />Even 40 is not too, too, bad for a quarter.

				Depends on where you live as to how high the level of sanitation required. My GF and I just plucked and ate 160 g last w/e which was pretty cool as it cost us about 20USD for the spores and maybe another 20 for the other stuff. We ate one 1/2 of the harvest. Shrommery.com can help you sort it out. Grown in your own home, dirt cheap. Still I would rather do L and in most cases we use the shrooms for an opening salvo.

				Back when I had decent mj connections in the flesh, it was still hard to get shrooms... except when it wasn&#039;t. When it wasn&#039;t, it was dirt cheap. The rest of the time you (well, I) would take them at any price. So kind of a weird market.<br /><br />But yeah, grow em. Hell yeah. I said elsewhere on the forums that I was all set to do so (and excited about it, too) but am not going to commit legal suicide by growing at an address I&#039;m having SR goods sent to. So for now that&#039;s out. :(

				Here is the clearnet link: http://www.shroomery.org/11432/Lets-Grow-Mushrooms-Pf-tek-videos<br /><br />Vid here describes a simple process using 1/2 pint mason jars, brown rice flour, and vermiculite along with a spore syringe to colonize about 2.5 quarts of material (takes 3-5 weeks depending on temperature, strain) whereupon the material is birthed and placed in a &quot;terrarium&quot;. Here this term refers to a large plastic container with roughly 4&quot; of perlite in the bottom that is kept moist. This helps to maintain conditions at 95%+ relative humidity. Another 1-2 weeks required for fruiting. In demo, narrator uses gloves, mask and a cheap glove box--another plastic tub that has a couple of arm holes cut out so as to keep the jars out of the &quot;breeze&quot; during inoculation (injecting .25 cc of spore solution into each jar). Gloves and mask a good idea IMO--box a bit of overkill but again may depend on where you live.&nbsp; So figure on two months to get your first crop which will certainly be a couple doses plus. Simple mods such as adding casing layer will bump yields substantially but add time, complexity and risk of contamination/failure. IMHO well worth it tho as the bare cakes are somewhat higher maintenance and may only throw up a few shrooms at a time whereas the same cakes properly cased will throw up over 100 mushrooms at a time.&nbsp; Nice thing about the technique described in the vid: requires no pressure cooler, just simple items found in any kitchen. The author hangs on the forums a lot and will answer any questions posted--pretty much a bullet proof tek that anyone with half a brain can do. Just can&#039;t rush things--plan on two months between start and first couple crops.

				just realize its not a fast process by any means. if you grow yourself the first batch is painfully long..... so buy my mushrooms while you wait&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />yah its not THAT hard to grow a few i promise you running a continuous running grow is a bit more tricky.

Besides I think they were just as strong as the first batch of fruit grown according to PF-Tek. <br /><br />And I dont think tolerance is a big issue--no more often than every two weeks. So finally the question:&nbsp; Are these shroomery cats a bunch of light weights or do I have a weak strain and maybe need to pony up for something else. Any light u can shed greatly appreciated...

				Exactlly wgeree we are at--50/50 coco-verm casing.First try: first flush with 1 qt of BRF/verm&nbsp; yielded 300+ grams wet. Maybe you misunderstood, no issues now that I am casing, but glad to hear that 4-7g is a reasonable and not heroic dose. <br />Live long and prosper. Sometimes shroomery rubs me the wrong way--lot of self righteous jerks live there. Lots of oood knowledge under the advanced topics. Wish I had access again to a real lab.phase contrast microsocpes, a laminar hood, and autoclave. But whats not to like about tek that is virtually fool prook and costs less than a beer kit to get going.<br />LL

				And secondly whilst im here id like some advice. Im an mdma fiend that needs a little crossborder advice ;) <br />For years weve travelled from the uk to amsterdam and bought a magic mooshroom chocolate bar from a shop (under the counter ;) ) weve taken them at festivals for years and whether its the dark chocolate the mushrooms are set in or just the fact that because iv never tried magic mushrooms before theyve always been amazing. Just the right amount of tripping to see the music but not incapacitating. Im need some shrooms and theres no way I can get the time off work to go to amsterdam but im wary of just picking any random shroom that might have totally undesirable effects from sr. There was talk that they might have contained hawaiian or mexican mushrooms but im not sure. Based on what im planning to do ie go to a festival have a little trippiness yet remain mobile and euphoric what would anyone reccomend? <br />Thanks in advance

				I noticed Roger Rabbit&#039;s videos being tossed around earlier, they are definitely worth the purchase.&nbsp; He put a lot of time and money into those when he thought he was going to make some dough on them...didn&#039;t happen and that&#039;s why people are so pissed that they are pirated.<br /><br />That being said if you don&#039;t have the extra dough I&#039;d go ahead and pirate it.&nbsp; It&#039;s definitely worth the watch and the knowledge contained in them should definitely be shared.&nbsp; I believe he offers the whole set of DVDs on his site in various forms now for much cheaper than they used to be.<br /><br />As for growing, keep it clean people!&nbsp; Clean environments make for happy mushrooms :)

				I tried to start a commercial first grow several months ago when many vendors where out..&nbsp; i thought i was going to $boom..&nbsp; &nbsp;hahaha...&nbsp; &nbsp;several months later i have about a quarter of shrooms when i was expecting dry pounds.&nbsp; &nbsp;i&#039;m still doing good, but they grew slower, and less yield than what i expected.&nbsp; growing shrooms take a lot of planning, and even more patience.&nbsp; &nbsp;My commercial operation is on hold while i learn the ropes more, which will take several more months i suppose.&nbsp; &nbsp;i am tripping on free shrooms whenever i want now, and they are very strong :)<br /><br />and trust me, you do need lights, space, a surefire way to control temperature, and a fair amount of startup money if you really want to grow big.&nbsp; and what the fukk was i thinking trying to do a bulk pf tek?&nbsp; pressure cooking hundreds of jars then knocking them up is not easy. with that said, i understand the high price now.

You need to move to coco bulk teks. You are still gonna need to knock up 100&#039;s if not thousands of jars monthly for a true commercial grow. And thank you, it takes MAJOR equipment and space to start up a TRUE operation like the one that I am still to this day expanding on and still have thousands in sunk costs that have not returned yet. Thinking anything otherwise is naive at best.
