				Most people wouldn&#039;t associate psychedelics with right-wing thinkers, but some of the most interesting psychonauts were fascists and conservatives. Julius Evola, a traditionalist conservative, mystic, and philosopher, experimented with LSD and considered psychedelics drugs as an important tool for spiritual enlightenment:<br /><br />&quot;An effective use of these drugs would presuppose a preliminary &quot;catharsis&quot;, that is, the proper neutralization of the individual unconscious substratum that is activated; then the images and senses could refer to a spiritual reality of a higher order, rather than being reduced to a subjective, visionary orgy. One should emphasize that the instances of this higher use of drugs were preceeded not only by periods of preparation and purification of the subject, but also that the process was properly guided through the contemplation of certain symbols. Sometimes ”consecrations” were also prescribed for protective purposes. There are accounts of certain indigenous communities in Central and South America whose members, only under the influence of peyote, hear the sculpted figures on ancient temple ruins &quot;speak&quot;, revealing their meaning in terms of spiritual enlightenment. The importance of the individuals attitude clearly appears from the completely different effects of mescaline on two contemporary writers who have experimented with drugs, Aldous Huxley and RH Zaehner. And it is a fact in the case of hallucinogens like opium and in part, hashisch, this active assumption of the experience that is essential from our point of view is generally excluded.<br /><br />&quot;In general, one must keep in mind that drug use even for a spiritual end, that is, to catch glimpses of transcendence, has its price. How drugs produce certain psychic effects has not yet been determined by modern science. It is said that some, like LSD, destroy certain brain cells [This was disproven after he died.] One point is certain: Habitual use of drugs brings a certain psychic disorganization: one should substitute for them the power of attaining analogous states through one’s own means. Therefore, when one has chosen a path based on the maximum unification of all one’s psychic faculties, these drawbacks must be kept firmly in mind.&quot;<br /><br /><br />

				Terrence McKenna, one of the world&#039;s top psychonauts, praised fascism (or at least &quot;where it came from&quot;) as being part of a global archaic revival that rejected outright the modern world and its values. In his view, fascism and the carefree long-hair, barefoot hippie worldview were two sides of the same coin. A lot of psychedelic gurus&nbsp; (Aldous Huxley, Albert Hofmann, Alan Watts) were right-wingers…or at the very least they had connections with the far right.<br /><br />The very word &#039;psychonaut&#039; was coined by Ernst Jünger, a German conseravtive writer who sympathised with fascism. In a letter to his friend Albert Hofmann (discoverer of LSD), he writes:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wine is to psychedelics as classical physics is to modern physics. ... These substances do not involve comforting fictions, but rather realities, if we take the matter earnestly. And few contacts will suffice here for the setting of courses and guidance. It also transcends theology and belongs in the chapter of theogony, as it necessarily entails entry into a new house, in the astrological sense. At first, one can be satisfied with this insight, and should above all be cautious with the designations. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The following is an extract from the work &quot;Approaches-drugs and inebriation&quot; in which he describes his experience with magic mushrooms:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">As usual, a half hour or a little more passed in silence. Then came the first signs: the flowers on the table began to flare up and sent out flashes. It was time for leaving work; outside the streets were being cleaned, like on every weekend. The brush strokes invaded the silence painfully. This shuffling and brushing, now and again also a scraping, pounding, rumbling, and hammering, has random causes and is also symptomatic, like one of the signs that announces an illness. Again and again it also plays a role in the history of magic practices.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; By this time the mushroom began to act; the spring bouquet glowed darker. That was no natural light. The shadows stirred in the corners, as if they sought form. I became uneasy, even chilled, despite the heat that emanated from the tiles. I stretched myself on the sofa, drew the covers over my head.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Everything became skin and was touched, even the retina-there the contact was light. This light was multicolored; it arranged itself in strings, which gently swung back and forth; in strings of glass beads of oriental doorways. They formed doors, like those one passes through in a dream, curtains of lust and danger. The wind stirred them like a garment. They also fell down from the belts of dancers, opened and closed themselves with the swing of the hips, and from the beads a rippling of the most delicate sounds fluttered to the heightened senses. The chime of the silver rings on the ankles and wrists is already too loud. It smells of sweat, blood, tobacco, chopped horse hairs, cheap rose essence. Who knows what is going on in the stables?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It must be an immense palace, Mauritanian, not a good place. At this ballroom flights of adjoining rooms lead into the lower stratum. And everywhere the curtains with their glitter, their sparkling, radioactive glow. Moreover, the rippling of glassy instruments with their beckoning, their wooing solicitation: &quot; Will you go with me, beautiful boy?&quot; Now it ceased, now it repeated, more importunate, more intrusive, almost already assured of agreement.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Now came forms-historical collages, the vox humana, the call of the cuckoo. Was it the whore of Santa Lucia, who stuck her breasts out of the window? Then the play was ruined. Salome danced; the amber necklace emitted sparks and made the nipples erect. What would one not do for one&#039;s Johannes? [Translator&#039;s note: &quot;Johannes&quot; here is slang for penis, as in English &quot;Dick&quot; or &quot;Peter.&quot;] -damned, that was a disgusting obscenity, which did not come from me, but was whispered through the curtain.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The snakes were dirty, scarcely alive, they wallowed sluggishly over the floor mats. They were garnished with brilliant shards. Others looked up from the floor with red and green eyes. It glistened and whispered, hissed and sparkled like diminutive sickles at the sacred harvest. Then it quieted, and came anew, more faintly, more forward. They had me in their hand. &quot;There we immediately understood ourselves.&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Madam came through the curtain: she was busy, passed by me without noticing me. I saw the boots with the red heels. Garters constricted the thick thighs in the middle, the flesh bulged out there. The enormous breasts, the dark delta of the Amazon, parrots, piranhas, semiprecious stones everywhere.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Now she went into the kitchen-or are there still cellars here? The sparkling and whispering, the hissing and twinkling could no longer be differentiated; it seemed to become concentrated, now proudly rejoicing, full of hope.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It became hot and intolerable; I threw the covers off. The room was faintly illuminated; the pharmacologist stood at the window in the white mandarin frock, which had served me shortly before in Rottweil at the carnival. The orientalist sat beside the tile stove; he moaned as if he had a nightmare. I understood; it had been a first round, and it would soon start again. The time was not yet up. I had already seen the beloved little mother under other circumstances. But even excrement is earth, belongs like gold to transformed matter. One must come to terms with it, without getting too close.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; These were the earthy mushrooms. More light was hidden in the dark grain that burst from the ear, more yet in the green juice of the succulents on the glowing slopes of Mexico. . . . [Translator&#039;s note: Jünger is referring to LSD, a derivative of ergot, and mescaline, derived from the Mexican peyotl cactus.]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The trip had run awry—possibly I should address the mushrooms once more. Yet indeed the whispering returned, the flashing and sparkling—the bait pulled the fish close behind itself. Once the motif is given, then it engraves itself, like on a roller each new beginning, each new revolution repeats the melody. The game did not get beyond this kind of dreariness.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t know how often this was repeated, and prefer not to dwell upon it. Also, there are things which one would rather keep to oneself. In any case, midnight was past....<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; We went upstairs; the table was set. The senses were still heightened and the Doors of Perception were opened. The light undulated from the red wine in the carafe; a froth surged at the brim. We listened to a flute concerto. It had not turned out better for the others: How beautiful, to be back among men.&quot; Thus Albert Hofmann. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

				Lots of serious bad guys have been involved with LSD. <br /><br />CIA for one was long hopeful it could be used for mind control.<br />Aum Shinrikyo - the japanese cult that nervegassed the tokyo subway in the 90&#039;s ran LSD labs and used acid as part of their inition rites.<br /><br />It is in my opinion a tool that can do great good or harm depending on how it is used.<br /><br />

LSD, and many other psychedelics, can truly be used in psychological torture, even mental bondage. In these situations it would be incredibly possible to use LSD in order to indoctrinate others. That&#039;s simply the nature of the drug. It can make your brain into putty ready to be molded, be that by the spiritual forces in your own experiences, or through the indoctrination at the hands of someone with more power than you in the situation.
