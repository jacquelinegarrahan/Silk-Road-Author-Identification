				As I was breaking up my morning breakfast of champion crystals it suddenly dawned on me. I had an epiphany of sorts. What if the Governments looking at drug use in this country and how they spend billions of billions of dollars they thought hmmmm how can we get in on the action. To me it makes sense because the Government has proven they&#039;re greedy and they don&#039;t care about the peoples welfare. So they went ahead and allowed all types of pain pills, benzos, etc to be handed out like candy. In there rationality they figured that &#039;hey we&#039;ll get them hooked on these, they won&#039;t be buying off the streets, less crime and we profit! cha ching&#039;. <br /><br />However I don&#039;t think they had the foresight to consider the consequences of those actions and how addicitve those medications were. Now in authoritarian style they are cracking down the whip hard on pain pill abusers, doctors that write too many scripts for narcotics, distrubution centers that don&#039;t file proper reports but in end it&#039;s the government that perpetuated this whole situation.<br /><br />What do you guys think?&nbsp; Do I have a point or should I leave the meth alone for today?

				It&#039;s true govmints (especially this one here in the bad ole us) don&#039;t give a fuck about ordinary people. But they do care about looking good and &quot;playing the part&quot;, and as long as people keep thinking that drugs are horrible and they&#039;ll spoil their young daughters&#039; nubile complexions, the govs will keep with the idiotic war on some drugs, no matter how much money they waste on it.

				Yeah, this sounds about right.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been thinking about this for a while now, albeit from a slightly different perspective.&nbsp; In the US people are trained to use a quick band-aid, rather than fix the problem behind the symptoms.&nbsp; This then leads to people becoming addicted to medications and paying out lots of money over the course of a lifetime.&nbsp; <br /><br />Think about the child that get&#039;s started on ADD medication, rather than learning to live with their problem, and building solid coping mechanisms.&nbsp; The body gets used to the medication, then as the child grows up they are switched to different medications for ADD/ADHD, and possibly even more medications for Anxiety/Depression, which are created by the initial med...<br /><br />Now think about how many people they have done this with.&nbsp; It&#039;s all just a racket.&nbsp; As you said, all they care about is the dollar signs.<br /><br />It&#039;s a shame really.

So in your example for the kid with ADD how is that acceptable and having a marketplace like SR where people can make there own decisions to put what they want in there bodies. Why cause the Government has money to be made from that. I&#039;ve actually read quite a few books on ADD just out of curiosity. Well actually I was trying to learn as much as possible so I could go to a shrink and a cop a script of addies but I digress what I found out as the common denominator by all those authors is that medication was not the first answer to the problem of ADD. Changes in lifestyle, the way parents teach and talk to kids with ADD, etc. These were previous psychologist and doctors that specialized in ADD and had decades of experience in this matter.<br /><br />&nbsp;So when parents go to a Doctor and complains of the childs misbehaviour and lack of attention it&#039;s ok for the Doctor to give this child a powerful stimulant that will change his/her life forever? That&#039;s ok and we accept that HUH?! Why cause the Doctor went to school for 10 years that makes him/her more all knowing. Let me tell you I&#039;ve meet some Doctors and Pharmacists that I have a better understanding of medications and there side effects and I&#039;ve done no work in the health care field besides my own research. The point of it is I think there&#039;s a serious hypocrisy and double standard here being played by the US. I love the fact I can get anything I want from SR whether it be Meth, Opiates, Heroin, w/e.... but if we look at the bigger picture maybe one day instead of pharmacies and doctors we can just get all our meds/drugs online. What does a Doctor do really? His medical knowledge? Ok fine fine that&#039;s simple just make a computer wth a database and put in every sickness, ailgnment, disease known to man and the symptoms and build a scanner into that can scan someone for that. (I&#039;m just having fun with this but it is possible) =)

				Very well put Miah.&nbsp; Many mental illnesses can be fixed with enough effort.&nbsp; I&#039;m not saying all, but many.&nbsp; Some don&#039;t realize the power they have inside, to make beneficial changes to their life.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#039;s the fact that a life is off balance, and something small just needs to be changed, like diet or exercise.&nbsp; Other times it takes bigger changes like finding a different career path, mending a relationship with someone in your life, building self confidence, etc.
