				For Americans, say something more original than the DEA. <br /><br />Thoughts? I know we&#039;ve got a lot of libertarians here, so I expect some pretty full lists.

				I do not really know about eliminate...the DEA would still have a purpose I think even if drugs were legalized, and that would be making sure that the cartels do not go around killing people, since I doubt that legalization of drugs will make them lose their desire to make loads of money. I think the most impact in terms of elimination would be in legislation. The FBI and CIA serve their own purposes, although I think that the NSA and CIA might as well be combined, same as FBI and DHS, and the ATF + DEA.<br /><br />The only departments we would need would be something for internal affairs, foreign affairs, health, IRS, most things that could happen fall under the jurisdiction of one of those groups. I think everything else is fairly extraneous.

				Military, state monopoly on violence innit. Remove the state&#039;s monopoly on violence and you eliminate the guardians of private property, from then revolution is much easier
