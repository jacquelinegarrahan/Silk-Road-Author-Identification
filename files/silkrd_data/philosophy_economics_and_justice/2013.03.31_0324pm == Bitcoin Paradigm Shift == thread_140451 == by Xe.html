				I have spotted this book reading club and i&#039;d like to introduce my discovery to the sr.<br />This little book is very tough on applied psychology and full of insights about the last taboo.<br />Do you think bitcoins or ripples have something to do with the proposed model or can it be adjusted?<br /><br />http://3fnhfsfc2bpzdste.onion/files/MysteryMoney02Lietaer.7z<br /><br />What can a fish know about the nature of water? It can&#039;t apprehend it because it swims in it, lives in it.<br />It has to jump out of it in order to gain a perspective. So it is for us with money. Money is not a thing;<br />it is an agreement within a community to use something as a medium of exchange.<br /><br />An incredible variety of objects or conventions have been used as money by different societies.<br />But in all cases, just about everybody in each society takes completely for granted their own money system.<br />It&#039;s something inherited, and its use goes on unquestioned. This is still the case today, even for the vast majority<br />of economists and financial experts.<br /><br />In other words, money tends to be an unconscious agreement. We swim in it. This is why we need<br />to search for answers about the origin of the emotions around money in the collective unconscious of a society.<br /><br />The work of Carl Gustav Jung and his followers in Archetypal Psychology provides us with a substantial<br />and established conceptual framework with which to examine the collective unconscious.<br />Using this tool, we will discover that money systems are an important reflection of a society’s<br />perception about the material world, and the feminine in particular.<br /><br />

				1. Agreed 100%<br />2. Was given Rand&#039;s 694 page novel &#039;The Fountainhead&#039; as a gift, it&#039;s collecting dust and your comment didn&#039;t inspire any further motivation&nbsp; :P<br />There&#039;s some real value in economic theory, if you never understood Marxism or Ricardo&#039;s work then you wouldn&#039;t even be able to comment on these things with any degree of intellect. You wouldn&#039;t understand left-wing/right-wing mentalities, you wouldn&#039;t have a clue about political institutions/actors or the effects of neoliberalism. It&#039;s just a little ironic that you&#039;re discrediting these &#039;academic&#039; topics which you&#039;ve already studied... <br /><br />Ok, so maybe the Ying and Yang thing doesn&#039;t hold any real practicality for today&#039;s investor... We&#039;re with you on that. However, the &#039;academics&#039; amongst us may find it thought provoking...<br /><br />3/4. Good to hear that you&#039;re a man/woman of reason; do you think this whole school of thought would have gained such momentum in modern society without the student uprisings of the 60s, driven by the work of the scholars. Our apologies to the religionists, but if we didn&#039;t have the theorists then there would be no momentum behind the movement against conservative &#039;bullshit&#039;. No mixed economy would mean less people clothed and fed, there&#039;s no doubt about that...<br /><br />5. For good measure you can go fuck yourself too!<br /><br />+1 for not being as stupid as you appeared in your first post! :P

				I was talking about the 1069 page (just checked) Atlas Shrugged.&nbsp; Whew-what a book.&nbsp; The Fountainhead–that&#039;s only 700 pages, a light and quick read!&nbsp; ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;Ayn Rand and friends all have legitimate theories and they have value if you&#039;re Ben Bernake, but the average investor (let alone member to a forum associated to a site that sells drugs&nbsp; :o ) has no use for such an ivory tower.<br /><br /><br />As to the popularity of humanism, I think the entire atmosphere of the 60s in America lent itself to such a view.&nbsp; JFK was president and times were good, people were making money, and generally had no need to put faith in a higher power.&nbsp; They saw that they are in control of their own destiny (including the Cuban Missile Crisis) and their views slowly shifted toward humanism.&nbsp; I also like to think that any intelligent being would end up with humanistic ideals own their own just by living a while.&nbsp; ;) <br /><br />My apologies Xe, your thread is officially hijacked.<br /><br />lelmeriodici<br />

				Yes, During the 60s the atmosphere was certainly different in the US than in Europe.<br />Social movements throughout Europe were still ideologically open to the communist model while anti-USSR propaganda filled the television screens in the US. <br /><br />Many Europeans still fantasied about &#039;Marx&#039;s utopia&#039; but weren&#039;t satisfied with the &quot;class divide&quot; explanation anymore so they turned to new authors like Touraine. They were more (and still are) naturally inclined to push for revolutionary ideals while US were more (and still are) concerned with maintaining the liberties their constitution affords them.<br /><br />To overly simplify, the Europeans are more progressive (humanist) while Americans are more traditional (conservative). We understand that this is an exaggeration but one look at the &quot;moral &gt; ethical&quot; structure of American&#039;s Republican party in contrast with equivalents from across the Atlantic gives us a clear example. <br /><br />There has been a shift toward humanism in the US; but it&#039;s stagnated by the religious-right. Mixing the virtues of personal liberty with judeo-christian faith has historically been a very effective marketing strategy for Republicans. It&#039;s a shame, because those individuals who believe in the evolution of human ethics (rather than &#039;family values&#039;) while holding free-market (or Libertarian) economic convictions are forced to elect a government which is far from humanist. (You could argue that the Tea Party is an exception, but find us an agnostic on the caucus and we will be very surprised). <br /><br />&#039;Born again&#039; syndrome is far from dead in the US of A - and much like communism in practice, it&#039;s a disease which holds society back from adopting more humanistic ideals.<br /><br />Anyway, back to dealing drugs like the dirty degenerate unenlightened people we are!<br /><br />Sorry for pulling a 9/11 on the OP...

				Having said that: I guess bitcoin would definitely be the &quot;masculine&quot; kind of currency as it is almost designed to encourage hoarding. (I use quotes as I am unsure how meaningful assigning gender is here )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How would the feminine kind work? A persishable item used as currency? Banknotes with an expiry date on them? Everyone gets paid their wage every month and anything not spent is deleted at the months end? <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Its very difficult to imagine how a society could function.... People could still accumulate wealth but they would just have to constantly exchange old notes for new..... But hang on the notes would become increasingly less valuble as their expiry date approached.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reminds me of a story by Robert Louis Stephenson about a magic bottle that granted wishes, but you always had to sell it for less than you paid for it. ( you did not want to die owning the bottle due to some infernal curse or whatever) But as the amount it was sold for decreased it became harder and harder to sell....&nbsp; &nbsp;the unfortunate owners had to go to poorer and poorer countries to find less and less valuable currency. I forget how it ended; look it up. Be a more worthwhile use of your time than this.

				<br />Please at least do a research on the author and<br />have a glance at the book first then decide if it&#039;s for you.<br /><br />The thesis is based on the Jung&#039;s analytical psychology framework,<br />it&#039;s the most valuable piece of applied knowledge I&#039;ve discovered in my life..<br /><br />It seems that Freicoin, a bitcoin fork, embraces the proposed idea..
