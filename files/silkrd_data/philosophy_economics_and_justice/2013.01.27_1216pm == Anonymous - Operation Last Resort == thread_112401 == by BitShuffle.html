				We should design an assassination market web application in Ruby using Sinatra.<br /><br />I find it appealing on many levels to have a web application engine named after Frank Sinatra used for constructing such a thing.<br /><br />How this would work, is people would place bets on when a specific public figure will die.<br /><br />The money, in Bitcoins, would be held by the server until a public figure dies, and the winner is determined by whoever bet closest to the actual time of death.<br /><br />The money is paid out to a bitcoin address registered with the account that placed the bet.<br /><br />Let&#039;s say, for example, George W. Bush Jr. was the public figure, and three people placed bets on his death.<br /><br />The closest one would win, and receive all monies in the betting pool.<br /><br />However, this web application does not yet exist.<br /><br />Someone needs to actually construct this web application.<br /><br />Ideally, the web application would be free and open source, licensed under an Affero General Public License version 3.<br /><br />Ideally, the development of such a web application would be done anonymously, such as via a Gitorious instance over Tor as a location-hidden service.<br /><br />This sounds like fun, doesn&#039;t it?

				I have another idea for an assasination market:<br /><br />set up a tor hidden service, where people can go and vote on who they want killed. similar to polls.. Once a certain number of votes is collected, a collection box is opened. The assassin names his price. If enough people are interested in getting that particular politician killed, they all contribute little by little. once all the bitcoins are collected, the assassin goes ahead with the job. once the job is confirmed by a newspaper report, the bitcoins are released from escrow.... Kind of like a bounty.<br /><br />maybe have a 25% advnce, so the assasin can procure equipment and plan/strategise<br /><br />maybe even have a 50% refund system in case of failed assasinations ( that would be funny )<br /><br />LOL...<br /><br />I have no evil intentions, trust me.. I do not wnt anyone killed, i just want them all to do some acid, <br />but this kind of system would be very interesting....<br /><br />I wonder what the bounty would be on conservative annoying american politicians...<br /><br />i wonder what it would be for DPR.....<br /><br />I wonder what it would be for ME for posting this<br /><br />

				I&#039;m not sure if posts about assassination are serious or not.<br /><br />Assassination is not the answer. It creates fear, martyrs, pushes people away from the cause. <br />Hacking, if successful, can find evidence of corruption and misuse of the system. I&#039;d imagine it could be fairly difficult to sully the documents legitimacy as the hackers would be able to show a trail of where it came from. Also it would be obvious they had hacked the website because they love to leave that weird poptart cat (honestly where did that come from?).<br /><br />I wonder how much good anonymous has done. Do they push their more serious findings to wikileaks, not taking responsibility publicly for their findings? I know they help spread knowledge of abusive police officers. Has there been any repercussions for those officers though? Why does the general public seem so apathetic to these serious violations of their rights and freedom?<br /><br />I don&#039;t see how insulting them does any good... These are people who see issues and wish to do something about them. They are capable of hacking so they try to change the world with their abilities. What are you(specifically The Scientist) doing? Sitting at home buying drugs and not giving a shit about the rest of the world?

				I think there are some here who are a bit premature in deciding that Operation Last Resort is nothing.<br /><br />Anonymous has unleashed 9 .warhead1 files, each named for one of the 9 Supreme Court Justices. These warheads are nothing but AES256 encrypted files... nothing more than megabytes of random data.<br /><br />If you watch the video, it is insinuated that these files contain information that DoJ and the courts probably don&#039;t want publicly available, and Anonymous will be releasing the contents of these files to news organizations unless there are changes in how people like Aaron Schwarz are prosecuted.<br /><br />Personally, I think its all quite clever. These script kiddies with their mad hacking skills snooped around the net and gathered compromising information. They are now using this information as leverage in a way that is keeping those that may be compromised pissing their pants. Nobody knows exactly what Anonymous has, what Anonymous will release, and whether they should be nervous or not.<br /><br />One might argue that Anonymous should just hand this stuff over to WikiLeaks or the the New York Times, and let professional journalists release (and redact) it. Personally, it I held the keys that were scaring the shit out of a bunch of powerful people, I wouldn&#039;t be in any hurry to hand these keys to anyone else.<br /><br />xoxo,<br /><br />- Bit<br />

				First off, assassination of individuals is right out. <br /><br />Helping Wikileaks out here and there is cool, they seem to be able to time some of their info well. But to me, Anonymous is very very good at manipulating and shutting down large and supposably secure, arcane systems (for Ex., sutting down MasterCard &amp; Paypal to protest MC &amp; PP&#039;s refusing to process payment for&nbsp; WikiLeaks a few years back. ) If Anon. really wants to engage in warfare, keep control of, say, Iran&#039;s centrifuges, or for fun, traffic light control systems in large cities (keep the cameras monitoring everything, makes for great internet watching!)

				Anonymous is the last restort.<br />a.k.a #OpLastRestort&quot;.... they&#039;ve had many other Op&#039;s as well..<br />like shutting down the FBI&#039;s website and allowing their servers to &quot;constantly&quot;<br />feed &quot;secret files&quot; into their servers. all &quot;encrypted&quot; with public keys.<br /><br />they shut down the Federal Reserve for a whole weekend..

Anonymous has the Government shaking.<br />there is more than one video.. there is more than one way.. and it is not just DDoS.. or SQL Injections..<br />or spam.. or just email flooding. Anonymous is not just going to smack everything at once.<br /><br />They are testing the government.. like HBGary.. who was hired to shut down Anonymous...<br />and well, HBGary got shut down...<br />#Anonymous hacked into FOX NEWS LIVE to display a message to the world.<br /><br />Anonymous is not a group of people..

What we need is an unpredictable population hitting them from all sides so they don&#039;t know what the fuck is going on. See at least half of Americans, and I used at least just to receive less bullshit semantic arguments from idiots, are too brainwashed to ever protest. Chock that up with laziness and fear of giving their life for a just cause, and you&#039;ve got yourself a pretty herd-able population.

Feds are still fighting for it.<br /><br />FBI is scared shitless. they should be.<br />no one is going to stand up physically and disarm the government, are you?<br />NO.. so if Anonymous can really do it then let them.<br /><br />&quot;We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget.&quot;<br /><br /><br />They are trying to reinstall our Constitution before it is taken from us.<br />the &quot;Civil Wars&quot; in Libya, Syria, Isreal.. they were shutting their internet/cell phones off..<br />guess what? Anonymous booted it right back up. <br /><br />as much as anyone wants to talk shit.. Anonymous has the Government shaking.<br />there is more than one video.. there is more than one way.. and it is not just DDoS.. or SQL Injections..<br />or spam.. or just email flooding. Anonymous is not just going to smack everything at once.<br /><br />They are testing the government.. like HBGary.. who was hired to shut down Anonymous...<br />and well, HBGary got shut down...<br />#Anonymous hacked into FOX NEWS LIVE to display a message to the world.<br /><br />Anonymous is not a group of people.. Anonymous is an IDEA...<br />&quot;We are everyone.. we are no one.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />WAKE UP PEOPLE.. either protest and fill the streets or continue to herd like sheep.<br /><br />/thumbs<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m all for hacktivism, but to say the government is &quot;shaking in their boots&quot; seems like a vast overstatement. I could see maybe the individuals in government targeted by Anonymous &quot;shaking in his or her boots&quot;, but I don&#039;t see Anonymous having done anything so far that warrants boot shaking. Defacing or taking down a website for a 24-48 hour period, firing up cell phones, or hacking into Fox News (and who really cares about that except Rupert)&nbsp; is stuff that would be considered a nuisance. Not really boot shaking material.
