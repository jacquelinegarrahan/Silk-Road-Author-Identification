				Its both physical and mental in my mind. The context of the orgasm also greatly effects it&#039;s potential. Orgasms from masturbation often leave me feeling dirty and unsatisfied - purely physical however Orgasms with the person I love leave me feeling fulfilled, loved and on top of the world which would lead me to think of it being mental tied in with physicality.

				relief of stress? <br /><br />i was walking and the worst fuckin diarrhea came over me. i nearly shit myself right there standin. in front of people.&nbsp; No toilets around so i decided to walk home.<br />&nbsp;4 kilometers at least. the feelin got worse and worse. i was holding it. but barely.<br /><br />So i got home. Sat on the toilet and I swear i had the biggest orgasm of my life. Not sexual. Explosive diarrhea. <br /><br />The longer you hold it the better it feels. <br /><br />This can be applied to sexual orgasms too. Like when you finger that virgin girl and she has orgasm for the first time. <br />Full body shaking, eyes go up. screaming. <br /><br />If you fuck too much the magic goes away, hold back and every single time will be heaven!

				Derived from the ancient greek &#039;orgasmos&#039; - sudden powerful feeling.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />- A pleasurable turmoil among human beings generally experienced near the culmination of the act of procreating, and/or lascivious activity involving sexual gratification. It IS that gratification. Also called &#039;blowing the load&#039; or &#039;shooting the wad&#039; for men and &#039;the tingle&#039; or &#039;religion without skepticism&#039; for females.

				I recently consumed a psychedelic drug that I had not tried before and had one of the most mentally orgasmic experiences I&#039;ve ever felt.

Both me and the missus work away so its either bang some hooker or save the money, not cheat on the missus and self service.<br /><br />And, I got to say, no woman can give a handjob like you can yourself! <br /><br />My tip is for any younger men who are currently just thinking that having as many women as possible is the best way. Tried that, just leaves you exhausted in the end, a bit of a mess. And your lucky if you get away without catching an STD.<br /><br />You only need one man/woman, but don&#039;t care if your with 12 as long as your all of age and consensual. Relationships are a job of work in themselves, but my tip is give her space - find shit to do without her. Give her small presents out of the blue. My fav is coke - give her the present and sail in the wake so to speak.&nbsp; :) Well, I hate to see someone get high alone!<br /><br />Go the beach also. Women love the beach. I personally see it as crowds of people, jellyfish, dangerous insects and litter. <br /><br />Walks in nice parks are good also. Anywhere green and not crowded is good for me.<br /><br />And yes, orgasm is the mental and physical. For men its also a visual thing - so dress up ladies!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />PS, got a buddy who is a pharmacist - his top tip for today is take 50mg of Trmadol if you suffer from premature orgasm, a condition that some see as a curse, but as you get older you wish you wish you could do again! <br /><br />Not heard of any drug that can make it happen faster, but there are physical techniques.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Good thread. Nice to leave work alone and think about this sort of thing instead of databases and moaning customers.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve had some excellent experiences in altered states where I&#039;ve had orgasms that have nothing to do with genitalia - orgasms centred in my brain, or elsewhere in the body - through simple motion, stretching, even breathing. Good stuff.

				Oh, also had an experience like the orgasms being generated (again, centred in the brain) was being used to crunch data. I&#039;d mentally work my way into an orgasm, let it fly, and use the energy to calculate and evaluate things.<br /><br />It was... weird.

I remember the first time I ever smoked weed I was put into a pretty much orgasmic state for the whole day but now whenever I smoke it, it mostly makes me paranoid and anxious. But I will have a look into these whole plant hash caps. <br />MDMA sometimes brings me to the orgasmic state, depending on the set and setting and dosage taken. <br />A mixture of good cocaine and mephedrone has also put me into an &#039;orgasmic&#039; like state, but it was different compared to that I had from MDMA and weed, not as good. It was less &#039;happy&#039; but more forced, if that makes sense.
