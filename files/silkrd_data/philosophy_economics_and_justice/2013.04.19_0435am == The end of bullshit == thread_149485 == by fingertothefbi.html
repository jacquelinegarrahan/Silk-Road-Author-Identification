				I think there are some serious indications we are. For one thing, the percentage of people who think doing drugs is ok seems to be increasing steadily, probably as old people die off. There also seems to be a much (and increasing) acceptance amongst the intelligentsia that illegal drugs are mostly safer than drinking, with many more coming out and saying so in public. In the wider not-about-drugs sense there seems to be a general trend towards a better society, though it&#039;s much slower than I&#039;d like. I think the critical factor will be not whether, given time, we would leave the Age of Shit, but whether we manage to move beyond before we manage to totally screw the planet and end up falling back into some kind of barbarism or a totalitarian society in response to a fall into barbarism...

				I think we will advance beyond having governmental control and since this human network is growing at an exponential rate it&#039;s only a matter of time. If the world is seen like a brain and its creating new paths in the network for information to travel then it&#039;s like a neural network that will continuously advance in the speed at which information is shared. Evolution of mankind on a large scale could be one way to look at it. Ever notice how 2 people on totally opposite sides of the world can invent the same thing at the same time as someone else but remain independent of each other? I guess I&#039;m relating collective consciousness to this as well.

But it is not hippie bullshit anymore. It has evolved into an incredibly wide spectrum of people seeking only one thing. <br /><br />Freedom. Which we are losing. Could we do something about it? Yup. Will we? God, I hope so. But realistically, no we probably will end up doing what people throughout history have always done in this situation; lay down and die. <br /><br />Me, naw. I&#039;ll be around. I promise you that. Fighting for everything the &quot;hippie bullshit&quot;. Personally, I&#039;m a hippie. I live in the land of hippie bullshit. And I freaking love it here.

				Sadly, not from where I&#039;m sitting.<br /><br />We&#039;re pretty much in a golden age of information. Pre-internet, you could spend an hour bickering about the correct lyrics of a song, because unless you had liner notes handy it was all hearsay. You wanted facts about, I don&#039;t know, average rainfall, you took a trip to the public library. There&#039;s a reason owning a set of encyclopedias was a status symbol. That kid with the super-religious parents couldn&#039;t find out anything about birth control. The internet is a goddamn godsend in terms of availability of information.<br /><br />Now, you can check all that stuff near-instantly, from just about anywhere. But you have to be better than ever at evaluating sources, and it&#039;s all mired in politics. Nearly everything. Identity politics, particularly. So yeah, you can find out the birthdate of that infamous political advisor immediately, but not what he&#039;s infamous for. Or ten different versions of what he&#039;s infamous for. Or bullshit made up facts arguing that he should be lionized instead. The facts are everywhere but drowning in spin. Expertise is degraded because everyone has an opinion and everyone is equal therefore all opinions are equal, no? And people seem more willing than ever to accept bullshit from &quot;our&quot; side and deny any facts the other side has supporting them. Zero intellectual integrity. As a result, the public is clueless or worse, willfully blind, the press is happy to stoke outrage, deserved or not, in service of eyeballs, and the government doesn&#039;t give a fuck about truth for the most part. In my country, currently, facts are the #1 enemy so let&#039;s do away with research. Facts get in the way of spin. They want to be able to say that crime is up, that drugs are uniformly bad, that bigger prisons are the answer, that the accused are always guilty, that &quot;they&quot; (whomever they are today) are less worthy of rights than we are. That there is anything that is in fact a right.<br /><br />So, sadly, no. Bullshit everywhere, and only getting deeper.

				There&#039;s a cycle of bullshit. In the same way that fashions rise and fall, so does bullshit. We might have a lot less Victorian bullshit nowadays (with open talk about sex, drinking, and increasing acceptance of drug use) but some kinds of bullshit are on the rise again...<br /><br />I point out this clearnet comedian who puts his finger right on the bullshit:<br />CLEARNET https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwK7VRkbGiU CLEARNET<br />
