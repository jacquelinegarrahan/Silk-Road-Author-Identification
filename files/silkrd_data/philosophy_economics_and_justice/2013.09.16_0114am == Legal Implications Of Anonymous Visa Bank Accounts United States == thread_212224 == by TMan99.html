				This is for something somewhat legal, and if I were to get caught all I would probably get told to do is stop and maybe other slap on the wrists.<br /><br />If the goverment caught me, would there be any charges for owning and using these visa bank accounts? I know under the patriot act all financial shit here has too have a SSN attached, but am not sure what they would do if they caught me with one of these in the United States...<br /><br />Does anyone have any ideas?

				What are you talking about? You mean like anonymous cash cards from Europe?<br /><br />Absolutely no charges for owning those. Besidesâ€”they shouldn&#039;t be connected to you anyway. The only reason they would know you had them was because they got you for a larger crime.

				Thanks for the reply. That is what I am talking about. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to talk about why, but it would be helpful if I can link these to things that are semi linked to me. It is a weird situation that I can&#039;t explain on here. <br /><br />But, does anyone else know if I could be charged for just owning these? This should have been posted in legal, whatever.
