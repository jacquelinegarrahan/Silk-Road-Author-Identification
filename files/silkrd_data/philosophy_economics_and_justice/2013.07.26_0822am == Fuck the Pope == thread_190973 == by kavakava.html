				Heaven forbid that people use LSD instead of going to church and getting molested. I can&#039;t wait for every Catholic in the world to get arrested for conspiracy to provide alcohol to minors. Maybe they can get them under RICO and lock them all up as child molesters.

				Come on fellow travelers I expect better insight than this. There is good and bad in everything man made. Whilst being critical of the so called leaders of religion we must not blame the underlying reason religion exists, to give people hope. The bible is against addiction YES. Drugs NO. We must not let the materials of this earth enslave us. Example, If i suddenly became addicited to apples, and only ate apples all day every day. This earthly material would become detriment to my health. Everything in moderation. Although some things should just never be consumed for the sole reason of the effects on human health. Addiction to anything is bad as our spirits are dimensional so if we focus our energy on one thing, other things in our lives start to fall apart. <br /><br /><br />Religion was meant to give hope. But is hope a gift or a curse.

In the same way the wine in the last dinner was much probably adulterated with Nightshade too (also of this there are historical, cultural and linguistic references).<br /><br />This is one of the reason why Christianity has no reason to exist in its current status; it has completely lost all its magical nature and so its soul. People that are turned Priest should act the same way as Shamans in tribes do and be able to communicate with God, but they cannot just because they lost the link, so how can they teach what they don&#039;t know themselves? A book cannot replace personal experience, especially a book that we don&#039;t either know from whence it comes and that it has changed by scribes for personal agenda in so many ways.<br /><br />*Experimental demonstration plus historical and inter-cultural evidence has almost completely established (to the point that&#039;s not simply a theory anymore but almost full evidence) that the ancient anointing ointment was made primarily with cannabis (and of its psychedelic origin there is complete evidence by now). THC is fatty-soluble and passes through the skin and in that ROA (as in ingestion) it is a psychedelic of either strong intensity (and probably to strengthen the ointment as a psychedelic either more it was mixed with other plants, as those of the Nightshade family). Cross-culturally, in fact, the use of cannabis based ointments has been documented in the following contexts:<br /><br />- Ancient Canaanite worshippers of Asherah<br />- Egypt<br />- Assyria<br />- Medieval witches<br />- 19th-Century occultists<br />- The Mid-East today.<br /><br />All of which are closely related historically or culturally with those of the bible.<br /><br />The theory that k&#039;neh bosem was the main ingredient of the early Jewish and Christian anointing oils is based on both linguistic and archeological evidence. Many researches further suggest that Nightshade was included in later versions of the ointment, as hinted at in the Song of Songs, and that Nightshade may account for the more pronounced visionary states that were attributed to the ointment. Moreover Nightshade was, in the same way, present inter-culturally in all those frameworks and hinted both in the bible and other various texts (as the Talmud or Kabbalah texts).

				Ah yes, the pope. Making decisions with little to no real education for a massive group of blind followers...&nbsp; Sounds dangerous as hell :) I usually consider the Pope&#039;s opinion on anything, other than the religion that he rules, to be worthless.&nbsp; As most people agree, though, he really does &quot;love&quot; the children.

				Fuck the pope. Religion is a choice and the pope should not have the status he has. Why should he?<br />He is just somebody who was brought up very conservatively and brainwashed into a lifelong commitment of living a boring life.<br />Fuck that. I&#039;m not against religion, but it should have nothing to do with drugs and personal choices about drugs. Perhaps if he had tried drugs, he would change his mind. <br />Everyone who is against drugs is brainwashed and has never used them.

				Hes the Pope - what did you expect? The whole concept is a farce. <br /><br />To be fair though, this is one of the most progressive popes there has been for a while. He recently went on record as saying &quot;who am I to judge homosexuals&quot;, and thats enough for me to hate him just a little bit less than I have his predecessors.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;You have to consider the fact that he is an Argentine- they have a serious problem with the<br />freebase cocaine and petrol mix known as &#039;paco&#039; there, people lose all of their teeth and sell<br />their children for paco, a pasty form of crack cocaine laced with cathinones or amphetamines.<br />Paco is the residue, the leftover of the drug trade, I have heard the tri-cities where the paco comes from is <br />an evil place where human organs are for sale.&nbsp; Of course, this is probably bullshit,<br />propaganda, if I thought my money would be worthless from inflation, I would smoke<br />crack, too.&nbsp; Pass the paco, I&#039;m going to Los Pollos Hermanos.<br />Oh, wait, thats Chile, my bad.
