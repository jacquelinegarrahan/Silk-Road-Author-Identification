Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.&quot; it is just that as always the church interpreted things as they wanted to. As an aside note the Christ is a gnostic figure, it has nothing to do with YHWH (and so the external concept of a God seated in a throne outside). The Gnostics believed YHWH to be an Archont, an enslaver of humanity.

				I think i&#039;ve met the dude in a restaurant. Seemed like a nice guy but probably doesn&#039;t have all answers like many and maybe he thinks. Probably just a guy with lots of power (and great control issues ofcourse) and lots of guilt like most politicians. Didn&#039;t bother talking to him and he didn&#039;t bother talk to me. I suspect he was a wifebeater. But the food in that place was heavenly :) If you read this God, please buy me a lunch there some time as I cant really afford places like that as things are now.
