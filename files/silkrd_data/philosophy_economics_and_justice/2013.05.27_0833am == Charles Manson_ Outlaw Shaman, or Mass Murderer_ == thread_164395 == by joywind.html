				Charles Manson on drugs:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nK_9k5nwFio (clearnet)<br /><br />Charlie Manson Exposes Illuminati Methods :<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkd4NYrzdFQ<br /><br />Summing up 25 years of Nikolas Schreck&#039;s research into the Charles Manson phenomenon, &quot;The Manson File&quot; illuminates unknown dimensions of Manson as philosopher, musician, Gnostic mystic, Mafia fall guy, revolutionary, and friend, lover and drug dealer to 1960s Hollywood&#039;s best-known rock stars and movie idols.<br /><br />Drawing on police evidence suppressed during Manson&#039;s trial, Schreck exposes the &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; legend as one of the twentieth century&#039;s greatest cover-ups, unveils the hidden Mafia drug-dealing background of the &quot;Manson murders&quot; and traces the underworld connections linking the victims to their killers. The author&#039;s recent conversations with Manson and others directly involved in the psychedelic era&#039;s apocalypse allow the true story kept secret for decades to be told at last. <br /><br />Probably the only out and out pro-Manson book that has ever been published. Contributers range from Manson sympathizers to out and out &quot;family&quot; members in essays and art. The good bulk of this book however is straight from Charles Manson himself. Interviews, quotes, transcripts of court and parole hearings, poetry and fiction written by Charles Manson, even artwork by him. The Manson File is probably the best book you can get to learn anything about Manson and his philosophy. <br />

				Obviously an insane person. Insane people are not incapable of achieving variable levels of consistent thinking and/or clear insight. Mentally ill and/or inhibited persons are not exempt from having magnetic personalities (e.g. psychopaths), and many (most?) sick/disabled individuals are yet capable of an astonishing capacity for interpersonal manipulation. Manipulation of others has extremely low requirements with regard to intellect. Anyone with experience dealing with mentally ill or disabled family members[1] will readily attest to this. Just like religion, if Charles Manson is right about anything he raves about, he&#039;s right by accident.<br /><br /><br />[1] at the risk of appearing cold, I&#039;ll point out that the same is true of our pets. they can and will manipulate you to receive any desirable rewards they perceive as being kept by you. this is readily apparent in the behavior of cats.

Regardless of whether or not he is guilty of mass murder, he is clearly no kind of &quot;Outlaw Shaman&quot;. He is mentally ill, highly intelligent, and dangerous enough to be forcibly removed from society. That is unless everything we know about about him and his life, including the videos of his wild-eyed ranting, is completely fabricated. Which would be a ridiculous thing to believe.

				He&#039;s everything they say he is, it&#039;s just hard to tell because he&#039;s incredibly intelligent and articulate and he has very rational views about a lot of important issues.

				neither shaman, nor psychopath, nor mass murderer.&nbsp; a simple con, who wasnt even good enough to avoid the death penalty for murders he never even committed.&nbsp; no philosophy outside of a born-to-be&nbsp; life-long-prisoner babble which is condescending, to hide his low intelligence and personal shortcomings.&nbsp; &nbsp;yup! another loser rotting , but with enough game, to enchant certain kinds of ppl, over and over again.&nbsp; no criticism for his&nbsp; enamours, my dislike is strictly for charlie.

Which is something I&#039;ve had alot of trouble understanding considering nearly all of the working middle class would agree that &quot;the Government&#039;s really fucking us over&quot; and other generalized grievances using blaming the &quot;government&quot; cause they don&#039;t know who else is really responsible for this mess we&#039;re currently in, without EVER further looking into who is REALLY responsible for fucking them over their whole life!! Not just for 2 presidential terms or what have you!! <br /><br />Furthermore I get angry when these very same people call ME an &quot;conspiracy nut job&quot; or anything to that effect and they&#039;re the type to not even be inclined to read a fucking newspaper let alone anything else for that matter. It&#039;s funny cause a vast majority of these same people still feel that their informed enough to challenge you to some sort of pseudo-debate over these matters and even in the face of presented with solid research and viable information will still resort to calling you names and other forms of low-brow conversation.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What are you talking about? Please be specific.

				Joywind, Manson ordered the murder of innocent people he was barely associated with. What if you had been in the Polanski house by chance that night? I don&#039;t think you&#039;d see him so romantically. Get your head out of your ass or the drugs out of your head for a second.

I can elaborate for you if you want but it was his comment &quot;the truth just sounds crazy to the ignorant majority. Anyone who knows the truth and lives by it is locked up and put on tranquilizers&quot; that I was expanding on. I don&#039;t want to waste both my time and yours if you&#039;re not genuinely interested in this sort of thing and I&#039;m especially not going to waste my breath if all I&#039;m going to get in exchange is to be called &quot;an idiot with too much time on my hands&quot;. I&#039;m not assuming that&#039;s what I&#039;m going to get from you specifically but it&#039;s generally the kind of response I can expect from the &quot;ignorant majority&quot; as The Scientist put it. And please don&#039;t take that as me calling you or anyone else here ignorant for that matter. Matter of fact I&#039;d prefer it if you didn&#039;t want me to elaborate for that very reason. But I will if you&#039;re actually interested.

And I&#039;m more than happy to discuss this stuff with you as long as it stays a conversation and doesn&#039;t descend into an argument and name calling like you see often see internet-wide. Also I need to tell you that I may risk coming across as crazy, raving lunatic due to the complexity and enormity of this kinda topic. I&#039;ll do the best I can to try and stay to the point but there are so many inter-related aspects to this discussion that it makes it very easy to stray from the original discussion. This often then leads to me being to articulate the big picture and quite often the person on the other end of the discussion feels no better informed than before the conversation started. And that&#039;s if I&#039;m no shot down by someone who wants to come out swinging with nothing but cynicism to offer to the conversation. <br /><br />So what is you want know exactly? Where would you like to start? Or am I just expanding on the quote from The Scientist for you?

				1. If you&#039;d follow the link you&#039;d be clearer about what I&#039;m asking.<br />2. Go ahead and take the risk of appearing insane. Perhaps I can either come to agree with you or talk you out of thinking that way :)
