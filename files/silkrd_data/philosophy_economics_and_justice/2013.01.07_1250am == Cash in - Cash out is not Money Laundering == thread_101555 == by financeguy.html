				Hi all, <br /><br />I am new to this site and would just like to say hello and start contributing to the community. <br /><br />Looking through the SR ads, I see there are people offering &#039;cash cleaning services&#039; by you sending them money and they send you money back. <br />This is not going to &#039;Clean&#039; your money. By cleaning your money it needs to be &#039;Legitimized.&#039; through legal businesses. <br />Unfortunately that means having to pay taxes on your earnings. <br />On the good side you can claim your expenses and then some&nbsp; :). <br /><br />It takes a bit of time to set up and set-up costs can cost anywhere from $5K+, but after that your able to legitimately invest in your retirement.<br /><br />

				Before you can legitimize your money you need to disconnect it from illegal activity. IMO both steps are part of the money laundering process.
