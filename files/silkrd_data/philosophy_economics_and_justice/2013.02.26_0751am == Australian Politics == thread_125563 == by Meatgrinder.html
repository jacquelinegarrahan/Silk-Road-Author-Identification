				As there are quite a lot of Australian users on the Silk Road, I thought we&#039;d discuss some politics, given that federal election will be happening later this year, and WA state election is only a few weeks away.<br /><br />Labor, Liberals or other - who will you be voting for and why? Rather blunt question, given the topic..<br /><br />I am aware some people will bitch that SR is not the place for political talk, but fuck em...

				Why the fuck would you only mention the two biggest fuck-ups of aussie politics and &#039;other&#039;<br /><br />What the fuck do i care? i haven&#039;t voted in over 15 years... fuck choosing between a Douche and a Turd. That is NOT politics, that&#039;s a fucking farce of a dictatorship.<br /><br />But if i had a gun to my head, i&#039;d vote the &quot;Shooters and Fishers Party&quot; in a second.

				Liberals and labor - they&#039;re both out. <br /><br />Shooters and fishers.. Possibly. <br /><br />The Greens? LOL<br /><br />Contemplating moving, this country is going down the shitter quicker than a slut on a dick in terms of politics. Up shit creek without a paddle, sadly. <br /><br />Is there anyway to become UN-enrolled ? Would rather not have to vote anymore.

				Australia&#039;s political climate is just so disillusioning. Two parties who dominate the media (and thus the polls) who sit in an identical place on the political spectrum which guarantees real politik and nothing getting done. Personally, I&#039;m voting for the sex party due to their pro-drug policy and distrust for religious institutions. As far as I can see, they&#039;re the only party that cares for drug users.

At this point they&#039;re too insignificant to warrant interest from major parties anyway.
