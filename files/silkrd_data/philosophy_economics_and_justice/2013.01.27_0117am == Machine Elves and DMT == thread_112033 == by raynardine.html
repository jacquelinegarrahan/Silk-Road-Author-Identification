				yep, elves are very common actually. there are many beings to be found in the realms of dmt. i just recently saw my first machine elf. it made me so giddy, i felt like a kid again. dmt interests me the most out of all the psychedelics simply because of its widespread occurrence. it can be found in many plants, it&#039;s produced naturally in the human body and is found in many other animals as well. i have a strong feeling that it is present in every living being, and that it is essential to life... we&#039;ll just have to see if my suspicions hold true. regardless, dmt truly is a unique chemical that gives us access to higher vibrational levels of reality, showing us how little we really know about &quot;reality.&quot; it&#039;s called the spirit molecule for a reason!

				DMT seems to amplify the unconscious to &quot;auditory&quot; or conscious levels. Unconscious mental processes are thus interpreted as &quot;entities&quot; coming from outside oneself.&nbsp;

				I am not sure who it was here on SR but they gave me the idea of using my Volcano Digit instead of the GVG I bought specifically for DMT vaporization.<br /><br />Since then reaching the desired effect level has become too easy almost.&nbsp; Instead of sitting there with flame and glass pipe in hand trying to make sure I both don&#039;t burn the DMT as well as don&#039;t drop the pipe, I now can lie back with nice music on, and just keep breathing in from the balloon until the world melts before me.<br /><br />I have only done this twice so far since I was taught this trick, with increasing success each time.&nbsp; I have never gotten up from the spot where I was lying yet.&nbsp; Plan to experiment more this weekend with my friend.&nbsp; I cannot imagine having the ability to either tear my clothes off or run around naked but I suppose everything affects everyone differently.&nbsp;

				I found a clear-net vendor, a shop in the Netherlands, that sold smokable ayahuasca (changa as you called it - I did not know what changa was, either). I would have to log off &amp; log on in non-TOR mode to get the address, but I have considered ordering some from this place. I do have some pharmahuasca I bought on SR (from Tesseracd4D, good to deal with), but I haven&#039;t quite worked up the nerve for DMT yet.

Say weed makes you feel like an alien, mushrooms make you think you&#039;re an alien, well DMT takes you to meet the aliens lol. To me it&#039;s not really a psychedelic, only a short window into another dimension with incomprehensible entities. Now I&#039;ve never taken a high enough dose of boomers to encounter the mushroom spirits or anything like that, but DMT is just a blast off for 15 minutes that feels like hours, and even lemon shots of 5g boomers don&#039;t really compare to the euphoria.

				Extracting your own DMT is not that hard, if you know your way around a kitchen, and can get some source material (many choices). <br /><br />It&#039;s a few days occasional effort, and very satisfying. And spring/summer is the time, when you can evap and vent to your heart&#039;s content. Was always struck by how the peeps over at [CLEARNET] dmt-nexus.me had a taboo on selling/buying DMT...<br /><br />The more efficient A/B (acid/base) method is basically: make tea, filter, make salad dressing, separate, make another dressing, separate again, and leave to dry!<br /><br />Synthesizing LSD from scratch it is not...<br /><br />And you&#039;ll have plenty to practice with. About 3% yield with Mimosa Hostilis, so 1.5g from 50g bark ($20 ?) plus solvents, obviously.<br /><br />I found a herbal sandwich in a waterfall (fountain) bong to be best of all. Direct vaping from a pipe was like an overspeed bucking bronco machine: you could rarely last more than a few seconds...

I only used gloves.<br /><br />1. Wash you main jar thoroughly.<br /><br />2. Add&nbsp; 1,000 mL (doesn&#039;t need to be exact) of water to the jar. (tap or purified) 1 mL water = 1g, if you are using a scale. <br /><br />3. Add in 50g of lye to the jar. Once it is all in, give it a slight shake / swirl until it is completely dissolved.<br /><br />4. Now filter in 200g of MHRB.<br /><br />5. Give it a shake for a minute or two, it should be uniform consistency when you&#039;re done shaking.<br /><br />6. Now store this is a dark and undisturbed place for 24 hours. A cabinet or closet is perfectly fine.<br /><br />DAY TWO -- DO NOT SHAKE THE JAR AT THIS POINT OR UNTIL I TELL YOU TO DO SO.<br /><br />7. Add 200 mL of napatha to the jar. (If i remember correctly 1 mL of naphtha = 0.7 g. But you should use your pipette and scale to confirm this.)<br /><br />8. Fill a crockpot about half-way with water and turn it on. The water should get to be 55-60 C or 130-140 F.<br /><br />9. Leave the jar in the heated bath for 30 to 40 minutes.<br /><br />10. Take out your solution gently (have a towel ready to set it on). Open the cap to release and built up pressure. <br /><br />11. Now, with the lid on, shake the jar firmly but not too hard for about 1-1.5 minutes.&nbsp; Do not make it slosh too hard. I go with a firm side to side shake that does not cover a very long width. <br /><br />12. Return the jar to the bath. Allow it to sit for 4 hours. This will separate the naphtha containing the DMT to the top.<br /><br />13. After the time is up, very, very gently remove the jar from the bath, set it on your towel, remove the cap, and allow to cool. DO NOT SHAKE.<br /><br />14. Once cooled use you pipette to extract the top layer of clear solution from the jar and put in your smaller jar. You can observe a line in the jar which is what you extract. Always keep the nozzle as high as you can to avoid sucking the impurities. Try to get as much as you can but don&#039;t sweat it about the very bottom, because most of the DMT is at the very top of the naphtha. <br /><br />15.&nbsp; Now put the naphtha on a well cleaned glass baking dish and put this in the freezer for 24-36 hours -- until crystals are present -- usually 24 hours. <br /><br />16. Take the dish out of the freezer very gently. If you shake it, they will dissolve into the naphtha. Using your pipette remove any excess naphtha.<br /><br />17. Set this dish in the same dark undisturbed place as you put the jar (or one similar) with a flat top covering it. Allow the naphtha to evaporate for a couple days or until it is gone. You should not smell any naphtha.<br /><br />18. Scrape the DMT from the tray. Now judge whether you need to recrystallize it based on texture and color, but more so texture. I may post a recrystallization method but perhaps not because there are many out there and they are all fairly similar. If done correctly recrystallization should be unnecessary.&nbsp; <br /><br />----- Repeat all steps after step 7 with new naphtha each time doing a second, third, fourth pull, until you no longer yield any crystals. The more MHRB you use, the more pulls you should do. <br /><br />PEACE -- DMTisinME&nbsp; :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I used an A/B technique over at dmt-nexus.me, which I can no longer find, apparently it was a bit hazardous for non-scientific types...! Worked absolutely top for me tho.<br /><br />Took about a week from start to finish, with only a few hours actual work.<br /><br />The &quot;current favorite&quot; for beginners seems to be this simpler STB tek, CLEARNET:<br /><br />https://www.erowid.org/plants/mimosa/mimosa_chemistry1.shtml<br /><br />I got all the necessary supplies via eBay, which probably wasn&#039;t the wisest thing to do, but I was impatient&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />MHRB is sometimes available as &quot;jurema&quot; for fabric dyeing purposes. Try and get the powdered form, the shit is mad tough and will eat your blender/grinder blades...<br /><br />In case you can&#039;t get the exact same items, chances are someone over at the Nexus site has modded the tek, or a version of it, to take account of substitutions.<br /><br />A good overview of teks is here, CLEARNET:<br /><br />http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/DMT_Extraction_Overview<br /><br />If you go A/B, avoid using vinegar as the acid (citric is better) because your whole space will smell like a pickle factory for days.<br /><br />Happy to answer any questions...<br /><br />Good luck, and enjoy your first attempt at molecular woodworking&nbsp; 8)
