				Are you mad at one cop or are you mad at the institution which he represents? Although I cannot blame you for wanting to kill a cop, I encourage you to think about being as effective as possible at doing damage to those who oppress you.

				That said your plan is horribly flawed. If you really wanted to kill someone and get away with it you would use a remote controlled UAV with an explosive charge, and control it anonymously. Lock onto the targets car, and bombs away. UAVs are proven as effective at killing terrorists! Or even an anonymously controlled UAV armed with an automatic pistol! You could control it and get video feedback from it via anonymized cellular communications , lock it onto target, blast, fly off. Unless they can trace the person who controls it, the controller is pretty solid. If they take it down, it has no fingerprints on it right? Launch another. They don&#039;t need to be fancy like the military has, just capable of flight for a decent distance and carrying a weapon. You could setup low latency anonymous control channels that would be anon enough (especially with some tactics thrown in) and low latency enough to allow for sufficient control. <br /><br />It sure is awesome being anonymous in a world filled with evil people who paint targets on themselves.

				That would sort of miss the point though. If I wanted to do it in that sort of manner, I&#039;d just brush abrin somewhere where his hands/lungs get a lot of traffic. But the whole idea is that he needs to know it&#039;s me.

				If he was truly serious he would not post his intentions. <br /><br />Maybe some reality and anger management is what you need. You are angry with the system, as any critically thinking human would be. Cops are not critical thinkers, they are for the most part good people who have been brainwashed since birth, just trying to make their min wage to put food on the table and a roof over their head. Do you hit a small child when they do something stupid? Best thing you can do is stay out of their sights, imo some of the best entertainment you could experience is a cop or seco with an IQ of ~70 on a powertrip, as long as it&#039;s not being directed at yourself of course some of their logic and stern expressions are hilarious. <br /><br />Went to a gig a couple nights back and the security guards, all ugly as sin of course, were jumping up in front of the band with torches every 2 minutes to warn people not to sit on each others shoulders, as that could block the view of other people. This level of stupidity had half the crowd seething, but I was laughing that hard I was in tears half the night. Don&#039;t feel angry, feel pity, and lighten up.

				Come on people please don&#039;t encourage the OP, he is obviously young, immature and possibly has some screws loose.<br /><br />We all hate cops but who are you to judge whether or not the world would be better off without him? It&#039;s your own fault you got busted for doing stupid shit in the first place. Committing the act of murder over something so petty will only bring a large amount of bad karma unto yourself and into your life. Let the pig learn on his own, there&#039;s still a chance he could change and be a good person. If you kill him another one will only take his place, probably an angry one since his buddy died.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that easy to get away with murder. If you do try to go through with this then there are only a handful of likely outcomes.<br /><br />1. OP murders cop thinking his plan was foolproof, leaves behind evidence anyway and goes to jail. Ends up on an episode of Snapped, life in prison without parole.<br /><br />2. Cop resists or something else goes wrong during procedure, even if he still manages to kill the cop he still goes to fucking jail and ends up on an episode of Snapped. <br /><br />3. OP somehow manages to get away with it (less than 1% chance of this happening), great now his ego is all blown up, he thinks he&#039;s somehow smarter/better than others and will probably try to kill someone again or do something else fucked up like rob somebody. Who in his mind thinks he deserves it, of course.<br /><br />Obviously the best outcome is OP does nothing, sits at home and smokes a joint.<br /><br />TLDR; stop being a moron and grow up OP

My sort of reasoning going into this is that for a while, I haven&#039;t been able to be at ease because this is at the back of my mind.

It really angers me knowing that his brand of hypocrisy and ignorance is allowed to thrive in our world. It makes more sense when you approach it from a more nihilistic point of view. <br /><br /><br />and I never did say my plan was foolproof, I put it up for scrutiny and the like

				Yeah this is pretty extreme. I don&#039;t think that one person is able to be judge, jury and executioner. You&#039;re always going to encounter people that you disagree with or who you think are terrible people. Don&#039;t get me wrong, there are definitely some people that deserve it (rapists, murderers). If you&#039;ve ever worked in retail, you&#039;d see that usually you&#039;d want to kill every 50th customer that comes in the door. <br /><br />This guy could have just been having a bad day. His mother could have died a couple days ago, his daughter raped etc...&nbsp; Also remember that you were doing the wrong thing in the first place... you might have been the 10th person this week that he&#039;s busted doing what you were doing and he was sick of it. What you need to remember is that you don&#039;t know what is going on in his life, which might explain his behavior. I know people shouldn&#039;t take out their anger on other people, but if you could honestly say that you&#039;ve never done this, then I&#039;d say you are a liar.<br /><br />I&#039;d think long and hard as to whether you think this is a good course of action and at the end of the day, this guy hurt your feelings... I personally think that there are very few reasons why people should lose their lives and hurt feelings definitely would be on the bottom of the list.<br />

Apart from it being morally wrong (nihilism aside) if you were to get caught, (and don&#039;t think they wouldn&#039;t have every cop in Keystone after you) you would face the death penalty. There is no more serious a crime than killing anyone in the judicial system. <br /><br />I kind of identify with you though. I remember a particularly arrogant fuck-wad of a cop from my youth. He seemed to get off humiliating kids and treating them as less than human. I&#039;m sure the only reason he didn&#039;t tie us up and piss on us was because there would be too many witnesses. Just know that a guy like that has let poison seep into his soul. He probably lives in fear of ... a lot of things. Those are the kind of people that beat their wives, have shitty relationships with anyone who is not exactly like them and live in a small pathetic world of negativity. <br /><br />I say let him hang himself.

				I would like to know what he did. Murder can be justified, but it doesn&#039;t seem that it is in this instance. You admitted it was minor yourself. And even police don&#039;t deserve torture. They are our enemies, and we should kill them when we the circumstances necessitate it, but they are also human and killing and torturing one police officer over nothing seems cruel and pointless. This is the same thing I dislike about the US Army; they are taught their enemies are not human.

				OP might want to consider taking responsibility for how they eventually came into contact with this dick officer of the law, instead of blaming someone else for their own personal experience. <br /><br />It&#039;s very simple. Either you are aware and conscious of being in control of your own experience, or you are a fucking victim, helpless, unaware, and seek to commit or talk about committing, entertain actually. disgusting acts that OP knows is entirely twisted. That would be &quot;hell&quot; to me. To see the OP has been hurt so badly by some random event with &quot;authority&quot; that is actually somewhat considered as &quot;normal&quot; in today&#039;s day and age. I&#039;m truly sorry to see you so hurt or shamed. I had an instance once where the cop pulled me over for a ticket I didn&#039;t even realize I did anything. He was such a fucking asshole about the whole thing. Condescending and all.... And you know what? Sure, I was seething... that someone could treat me with such disrespect. But, I actually saw that he was somewhat of a peer age to me, and probably hated his fucking job, because of what a joke it was.<br /><br />I fought the ticket and the fucker didn&#039;t even show up! DISMISSED. <br /><br />But hey, no one can stop anyone from doing anything OP. Just like no one can stop you from killing someone. It&#039;s a shit society, but if you can assume responsibility for your own experience, your own feelings, deal with them from however they&#039;ve come to be... cause we all have fucked up ass upbringings n shit.... then maybe you wouldn&#039;t be so compelled to entertain thoughts of such an atrocious act. <br /><br /><br />And hopefully this OP is just bullshittin... and you know this...

				@paraiso- Judge Dredd homeslice.<br /><br />@utensildude- you forgot one, OP gets his shot tossed and brains blown out by a professionally trained killer who sleeps with his glock underneath his pillow.<br /><br />@kmfkewn- probably the most practical reply on this thread<br /><br />and finally, for the OP -- why don&#039;t you give it a little bit of thought, or a lot, read crime &amp; punishment by dostoevsky in the meantime, and then reconsider what you are about to do.... when it comes to heinous acts that are premeditated such as this one, from the moment you step out the door to commit the murder, there will be major deviations from your original plan, sometimes fatal (in more ways than one).<br /><br />i, however, can relate to having murder fantasies -- was always someone random tho<br /><br />HTH,<br />chicken fingers.

				threads like these really get to me. this is not the place to get advice on how to murder someone. you honestly believe this cop treated you inhumanely enough to warrant his death? if so, you are delusional and in need of some serious mental help. if being an asshole was grounds for getting murdered, most of this country would be dead. think about this some more. not only will you end his life, but your own as well. you can&#039;t possibly think there&#039;s any chance of you getting away with killing a cop. relax, smoke a bowl, eat some mushrooms, and reflect on the interconnectivity of all life. resolve all the hatred you have in your heart, for it is misplaced and only exists to burden you.

				The fact that you&#039;re typing this right now means whatever you got in trouble for didn&#039;t really cause you to lose your freedom. You&#039;ve put a decent bit of thought into murdering him, but not a whole lot into getting away with it scott free. I&#039;ve had an asshole cop who decided to take me to jail from my driveway because I &quot;fled&quot; instead of pulling over a block or two earlier. Despite being totally sober he had the nerve to say I &quot;looked like I was on drugs&quot;, probably bias because of my long hair and beard. Even going so far as to say &quot;I think you&#039;re lying! We&#039;ll draw blood if we have to!&quot;. During searching me, my cell phone got stolen by one of the crooked pigs who came in as backup, and I&#039;d totally love both of them dead, but not over my own freedom getting taken away. He didn&#039;t bother buckling me in when I was put in the back of his squad car, and the entire 20 min. ride I kept praying he&#039;d get involved in a serious accident so I could sue him for every fucking cent he was worth. He had the nerve to try and have a polite conversation on the drive. If I ever have the kind of money to hire a hitman he&#039;s definitely at the top of my list. Just break in one day and hide a few gasoline canisters around the house, then set it on fire when he&#039;s in there alone. He might escape, but now he&#039;s at least homeless. If he dies in the raging inferno, even better, either way I&#039;d call it even. Abducting him from his house leaves all kinds of possibilities for someone to witness you doing it and leave a trail right back to you.

				You want to kill someone who was doing his job. You were doing something wrong, and you got caught. Deal with it. Would you kill everyone who stepped on your toes? Are you going to kill me for disagreeing with you? That&#039;s stupid, and immature.

				Have to agree with the other people who have urged you to think twice. Besides the fact that &quot;being an asshole&quot; should not be a capital crime... another thing you should consider are the innocent others who will be effected by your actions. The wife, mother, daughter, son, brothers, friends etc. <br /><br />The best revenge is living a good life.

I know I&#039;d prefer being murdered to going blind any day of the week. I wouldn&#039;t do the laser though to blind him. Just break in one night and stab/cut his eyes out. The last image he&#039;ll ever see is the smirk on your face as you do the deed. As Inquisitor (+ Karma your way) said you&#039;ve reduced him to begging to others for the mercy and leniency he refused to show due to his ego. Now he also has to decide whether or not he can even live in the house anymore, since it&#039;s where it all happened.

Nothing stops you from controlling a mini helicopter half way around the world from the comfort of your home and behind a few low latency high bandwidth proxies. It becomes a game of not being traced to your helicopter, and not being identified as a target worthy of being gunned down. Of course there are defense mechanisms against such attacks as well, but only very rich and important individuals will have anti UAV security, and only an agency like the NSA would have much luck tracing the controllers. <br /><br />

				My thought are nobody is worth risking my life in jail unless I feel its in self defence. If someone is trying to cause physical harm to myself or loved ones, all bets are off. I carry my glock for those very instances.<br /><br />Also rather than kill someone that is just more of an annoyance, just do things to fuck with them. Blow their car up, open credit cards in their name.. get creative..

				Good idea with the glow in the dark paint.&nbsp; Paint thinner would also do a number on a car and home.&nbsp; As far as blowing up a car, yet alone a cop&#039;s personal car or cruiser, any explosive detonation in the US is a federal crime.&nbsp; That means ATF and federal time with no parole.&nbsp; I&#039;d just assume shoot the pig than blow his car up at that point.&nbsp; Now, dumping gas on the car and lighting it on fire might only get you a state arson charge which might only be a few years depending on your record or lack thereof.&nbsp; That is not well researched info, just my understanding of the law and how it is usually applied in certain situations.&nbsp; Keep in mind fucking with a pig is more likely to get you sentences towards the maximum allowed compared to fucking with a commoner.

Sometimes murder is harder on the killer than the killee (sometimes...). Think up a non-violent way to get back at him, it looks like your doing this to give yourself the pleasure of revenge, and usually the more creative methods are better. The guy who mentioned blindness is spot on, but you could do it one better and make him helel keller with his dicked chopped off. Although that is definitely not non-violent.

This is obviously the best idea in this thread.<br />As for encouraging the OP to follow through with the &quot;Murder!?&quot; is the morally wrong decision. If you are trying to &quot;post&quot; legitimate ideas &quot;anonymously&quot;... This is the right place.. so to say.<br />Just go about it a different way... Obviously this thread is just going to get criticism.. instead of beneficial, structured ideas.<br />KMF has the most solid plan.. but he is a very intellectual forum member. He contributes to the community in more way than one from what we&#039;ve seen.<br />His idea is ingenious.. but can you afford it.. and let alone pull it off?<br /><br />Good luck and have a blessed day!

				I truly don&#039;t believe murder is ever the answer except in (extreme) cases of self defense. there&#039;s other ways to get back at this fuckhead than killing him. Ever considering drugging the ever living shit out of him? Pick up some liquid L, soak a letter in it and drop it in his mailbox. Follow him for the next 24 hours and watch him lose his mind before putting an anonymous tip into the police force that you have reason to believe a member of their unit is a drug user.<br /><br />Also lmao @ the helicopter comment.

Forget death, forget blindness, forget call of duty style helicopter tactics (LMFAO) what is the worst thing in the entire world for a cop? Going to jail. Assuming this guy has fucked with as many people as you think he should have I&#039;m sure he&#039;ll get passed around like a pin cushion. Seeing as this is a drug forum... why not buy every RC under the sun as well as a &quot;stash&quot; to leave in his house as evidence (cash, paraphernalia, hell throw in some CP) drug him with a ridiculous amount of acid/RCs&#039;s and wait. Doubt you&#039;d have to call it in at all he&#039;d probably go bonkers get himself arrested

I don&#039;t think that one person is able to be judge, jury and executioner. You&#039;re always going to encounter people that you disagree with or who you think are terrible people. Don&#039;t get me wrong, there are definitely some people that deserve it (rapists, murderers). If you&#039;ve ever worked in retail, you&#039;d see that usually you&#039;d want to kill every 50th customer that comes in the door. <br /><br />This guy could have just been having a bad day. His mother could have died a couple days ago, his daughter raped etc...&nbsp; Also remember that you were doing the wrong thing in the first place... you might have been the 10th person this week that he&#039;s busted doing what you were doing and he was sick of it. What you need to remember is that you don&#039;t know what is going on in his life, which might explain his behavior. I know people shouldn&#039;t take out their anger on other people, but if you could honestly say that you&#039;ve never done this, then I&#039;d say you are a liar.<br /><br />I&#039;d think long and hard as to whether you think this is a good course of action and at the end of the day, this guy hurt your feelings...

				Personal opinion as it maybe not what your looking for it maybe a look into a life you would never want. <br /><br />As you may not care about the next mans life is apparent and the thought that one mans single poor judgement shouldn&#039;t be enough for corporal punishment I would like to share with you that for the last 5 years SWIM has been awaiting trial for numerous counts of homicide and no matter how much of a accident it was and how close SWIM was to losing SWIM&#039;s life SWIM&#039;s been confined to home in which every month SWIM has to pay $750 for bracelets, monitoring, UA test and so forth. There is no amount of medication or incarceration that can help when you are constantly in a life of paralysis. THIS IS HELL! <br /><br />Do the right thing and assist in the efforts to take out big brother all the way down to the lower level servants.

I&#039;m embraced for the negative Karma I&#039;m about to recieve<br /><br />A while back, i was doing some kinda-stupid-but-not-really stuff and got reprimanded by this cop. The consequences weren&#039;t even particularly serious, but I can&#039;t get it out of my head how much I came to hate the guy for the assholish,ignorant, ultra-conservative, and hypocritical manner in which he conducted himself. It came to where I began to want to kill him, and then began to take that idea seriously after deciding I don&#039;t follow through on enough things in my life. <br /><br />As far as the moral standpoint goes, I&#039;d say I identify with nihilism quite a bit, and even if I didn&#039;t, the world would be a better place without this guy. <br /><br />So what I&#039;m wondering is would this even be feasible to pull off and get away with? <br /><br />My plan that I&#039;ve concocted would be something along the lines of kidnap from his house through a combination of means of tazer, threatening at gunpoint, mace/pepperspray, and a high dose of flunitrazepam so he&#039;s unconscience. Then, take a bunch of his money and personal info so it looks like he overdrew a credit card and fled, and plant some trace cocaine powder for investigators, so his memory has a whole lot less reverence to it. Meanwhile, I drive him into the woods, torture(I&#039;m genuinely convinced that wouldn&#039;t be unethical), and dispose with his body with hydroflouric acid.&nbsp; <br /><br />Again, would that be feasible? What about the listed method?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>In my country, we have a term for this kind of operation.
