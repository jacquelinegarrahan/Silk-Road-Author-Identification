				Anonymity is ideal for buying drugs online and obfuscating from LE, but the more I get to know some members of this community, the more I&#039;m seeing some drawbacks too. I&#039;ve &quot;met&quot; some really interesting people on here that I&#039;m pretty sure I would be really good friends with IRL. And because this is a black market drug site and revealing our identities to each other could potentially cost us our freedom, unfortunately we&#039;ll never get to be &quot;friends&quot;. We&#039;ll just keep hiding behind these avatars and screen names.<br /><br />Its a shame, really. I&#039;m a people person IRL and I really enjoy getting to know people. Especially cool ones. Oh well, I&#039;m chalking this one up as another casualty of the senseless drug war.

				Yes the anonymity is an unfortunate necessity.&nbsp; It&#039;s weird that in the spare coins thread I can lend somebody money and honestly have a better chance of getting paid back than if I lent the money to some of my IRL &quot;friends.&quot;

				I find that most people put on a fake face IRL and that I truly don&#039;t know many of the people I call friends.&nbsp; So on SR I really don&#039;t see much of a difference has IRL, except that I can&#039;t look someone on SR in the eye and judge for myself.&nbsp; I think more people are more honest about who they are on SR than most people I know in IRL.&nbsp; It really is a shame that we all can&#039;t have a beer and hang tho&nbsp; :-\

				I feel regretful about this one too. Especially in the rural area I live, it&#039;s tough to find people who are, well...intelligent and open-minded, as so many on SR are. In that way for me, it&#039;s a good thing...I can&#039;t meet yous guys IRL, but if it weren&#039;t for SR, I wouldn&#039;t have yous guys, period. <br />How&#039;s that for sappy?

				Hey guys, don&#039;t be sad!&nbsp; Maybe we&#039;ve already met at some music festival, a techno night, a random party or the crackhouse around the corner!<br /><br />I get what you&#039;re saying but make the most of the anonymity and yeah be yourselves on SR and in real life.&nbsp; There&#039;s really no other way.&nbsp; Only difference is that on SR we can say our word easily whereas &quot;IRL&quot; shy people might not be talking as much, or maybe some people are more articulate in writing where they can take their time.

				I know your feel. Sadly anonymity is a necessary evil in some cases such as using the Silk Road, otherwise you&#039;d be probably tracked by the cops.<br /><br />But who knows, I might meet someone from there some day. After all I met much more intelligent, friendly and altruist people in Silk Road forums than where I live, a very closed-minded, conservative and discriminative place.

				As the community grows rich, I am sure we will see groups using SilkRoad showing off cultural insignias that display ones affiliation with the trade.&nbsp; At some point your 10k bitcoins will be able to insure your non anonymous selves.

				I thought about this just yesterday. You can not really have a community meeting. Or, maybe you can. Why not. You can play &quot;find all the LE&#039;s in this room&quot; and the winner get&#039;s to ass-kick them out.<br /><br />Sure it would be nice to maybe make some real life friendships with people in your region, but that is simply not possible at all.

				I totally agree. There is some point where this first euphoric feeling about getting your &quot;drugs&quot; mailed is changing to a curiosity. You start to ask yourself who these people are that seem to share your thoughts which you often can&#039;t share in your daily life. I guess many of you don&#039;t look like typicall drug addicts or even look suspicious, so this &quot;find the LE&quot; could be very difficult ;D<br />I still hope that someday there will be a big change in laws. It would be no problem to meet, when we don&#039;t get haunted anymore...<br />

				Maybe one day, doubt it will be soon though. When people are anon, they don&#039;t have to pretend. People are generally more themselves, and that&#039;s a great thing. You all have a great community on here, incredibly secure for what it is. A meetup/session would be legendary!

				Lol a meetup would be kinda cool, but i&#039;d only see that happening if A) mailing drugs became legal or B) SR gets shut down and everyone meets up for a reunion at the hilton or something.<br /><br />I can see it now, couple hundred junkies all sitting around shooting up, smoking weed, snorting lines and rolling balls lol.<br /><br />Im sure by the end of the night it would turn into a clusterfuck gangbang
