				I tried to quit using but I was struggling. And i couldn&#039;t stay sober. Some hash brownies down the hatch. <br />Im staying in my parents house, stoned and I told my mother I do drugs. And all she said: &quot;why didn&#039;t you bring me some? &quot;jokingly..<br />A huge weigh has been lifted from my heart. <br />Breathing feels amazing. <br /><br />I have always&nbsp; been looking for&nbsp; the reason to live.&nbsp; I have explored my brain,&nbsp; hacked my brain. Creating new realities and new order just to blast it apart again. <br />I have found answers.<br />. <br />What we are, where we come from, where we are going, why we act the way we do. <br />Are we really conscious? <br />I see robots driven by genetic commands! programed by others!!&nbsp; swimming in the sea&nbsp; of illusions! <br />Is it really what my life is all about? I asked myself.&nbsp; being a slave machine?<br />My whole body is screaming for freedom. Something that never existed and never will. Driving me insane with rage. <br /><br />Once a friend of mine asked me what I wanted to be if I could be anything. I told him i would like to be a particle. Bouncing all over the galaxy. Dieing and Reforming. A particle affected by nothing. Alone and Free. <br />No thoughts, no mindfuck. existence and unexistance at the same time. Like death.<br /><br />My mind expanded. beyond everything I could have ever imagined.&nbsp; <br /><br />and suddenly everything&nbsp; became clear. <br /><br />The meaning of my life is to make someone else happy.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Please share your personal stories and views. I dont want to be the center of attention of this thread. I needed to vent&nbsp; and exhale but now I pass the spliff. post whats on your mind. Your own views. <br />This one is about you!<br />

				Since we&#039;re all dying I&#039;d say that the meaning of life is what you make of it.<br /><br />Try to keep happy by extracting the happiness from whatever the fuck makes you happy, even if it&#039;s doing drugs.<br />

				Zvp I can tell by your theory how you feel about life and the type of person you are, It&#039;s that simple!&nbsp; I am not going to waste words on this thread and it&#039;s not that I don&#039;t care to discuss life.&nbsp; It&#039;s the only thing I ever talk about!&nbsp; The only thing worth talking about in my opinion.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t get me wrong I have been way down on life, to the breaking point.&nbsp; That&#039;s where you really find the meaning of life, when you are about to lose it!&nbsp; I have been pronounced deadthis moment in life I am trying to help and show others how to find the bliss that I have achieved.&nbsp; You have to pardon me, threads like this make me incredibly uneasy.&nbsp; I don&#039;t under on a hospital bed, and that&#039;s where it all came together for me.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have words to describe my experience, if I could I can guarantee that it would change many lives.&nbsp; At stand how people don&#039;t get life.&nbsp; I do actually understand why, but at the same time I don&#039;t.&nbsp; I do know that each person will figure it out eventually, so that&#039;s what comforts me.&nbsp;

Attraction is more fundamental to life than even sex. Even inanimate objects are attracted to other objects. Sex is merely a manifestation of the much greater principle of attraction. <br /><br />Man is not just an animal. He has an animal nature, and in that respect the purpose of his existence is to reproduce, but he also has a divine and spiritual nature. The purpose of existence must be something that applies to all levels, not just the level of his animal nature. Love, which is attraction, the will to unity, is the only principle I can think of that would apply to all levels of human existence.<br /><br />To say that &quot;sex&quot; is the purpose of life is to debase everything by lowering it to the animal level. But love or attraction is a principle that is manifested in all levels existence, not just on the animal plane.<br />

We live in a very materialistic society that values sensualism, hedonistic pleasure, etc. I am not saying any of these are bad things. I am saying that humans need a balanced life that is not repressive either to our spiritual or to our animal nature. Exclusion of either side of our nature can lead to unhappiness.<br /><br />The spiritual level is higher than the animal. Our animal nature is a necessary and important part of our nature, but we can reach higher stages of development that are beyond the level of animal programming -- intellection, spirituality, etc. Hedonistic pleasure and sensuality can be very satisfying at one level of development, but they can lead to unhappiness when one is ready to go beyond that level.<br /><br />The levels of development correspond to maslow&#039;s hierarchy of needs:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; physiological (sex, sleep, food, etc)<br />2. safety (health, employment, property, etc)<br />3. love and belongness (friendship, family, sexual intimacy)<br />4. esteem (self-esteem, achievement, respect of others, etc)<br />5. self-actualisation (morality, creativity, rationality, etc)<br />6. self-transcendence (spirituality)<br /><br />Getting &#039;stuck&#039; at any one of the stages 1-5 leads to unhappiness. All of one&#039;s needs must be satisfied, not just physiological needs.<br /><br />By &#039;animal nature&#039;, I mean the stage of development corresponding to physiological and safety needs in the above hierarchy.

I see nothing but confirmation of religious scripture in the face of science. For instance, the fact that the universe is fine-tuned for the existence of intelligent life is a pretty solidly established scientific fact which demonstrates that it is vastly more probable that our universe is the result of design than chance. This only reinforces the idea of the existence of a cosmic designer. On scientific grounds alone, belief in God is rationally justified. (This has nothing to do with creationism. The exquisite fine-tuning of the universe is universally accepted in mainstream science.)<br /><br />but science, though it does not, i think, conflict with religion, should not be regarded the final authority on the ultimate nature of reality.&nbsp; Science has its own limitations. It&#039;s main limitation is its &quot;objectivity&quot; -- which actually means inter-subjectivity: in science, data that are shared between experiencing subjects are considered &quot;objective&quot;. Sharing the perception that humans have two legs makes it an &quot;objective&quot; observation. In contrast, seeing auras is usually considered &quot;subjective&quot; because this perception is not shared by many people. However, if the majority of people would learn to see auras, auras would become &quot;objective&quot; data that would provide a basis for scientific investigation. Hence, the scientist&#039;s state of consciousness influences his perception and limits objectivity in science.<br /><br />Other limitations include: language and mathematics (reality is a mystery that is beyond words, concepts, numbers, logic, etc. -- to describe reality in terms of words and symbols is to falsify it, even if it useful for certain purposes), rationality (trying to force the universe into a rational model based on the human brain is clearly anthropocentric,&nbsp; and leads to omissions and distortions), empiricism (inner experience is normally excluded from the realm of science, but this exclusion is an unnecessary limitation--inner experience can provide raw data in a &#039;broad science&#039; view of science), testability (e.g. the string theory and M-theory that are not testable and therefore are considered &quot;unscientific&quot; by many physicists).<br /><br />But even with its limitations, science is uncovering evidence of the spiritual reality -- quantum-relativistic ideas of an all-pervasive cosmic consciousness or Mind as the ground of existence (eugene wigner),&nbsp; lervin laszlo&#039;s concept of the PSI field (akashic field) and his connectivity hypothesis, david bohm&#039;s theory of holomovement, sheldrake&#039;s morphogenetic fields, the fine-tuning of the universe above mentioned, evidence of paranormal activity, telepathy, precognition, etc.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think obviously these ideas are why people turn to religion and i understand why, but in the face of science our universe seems to have little inherent meaning. The numbers are staggering- our sun is one of more than 100 billion( with a B) stars in our galaxy, and our galaxy is one of more than 100 billion ( with a B) galaxies that we can see- truly staggering. so really any big picture of universal meaning seems silly to me, but in the end we are given some time and to spend it the best way would seem good- like sharing love being creative and shit like that. but great thread</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I fail to see any logical connection between the size of the universe and the existence or validity of meaning and purpose within the universe. In fact, according to physicist Roger Penrose,&nbsp; the odds of our solar system&#039;s being formed instantly by random collisions of particles is about 1:1010(60), a vast number.&nbsp; It is vastly more probable that we should be observing a much smaller universe, if that were the case. Observable universes like that are much more plentiful in the ensemble of potential and actual universes than worlds like ours and, therefore, ought to be observed by us if the universe were but one random member of an ensemble of worlds. The fact that we live in a very large universe with billions of stars, etc., is only further evidence that the universe is designed; if the universe evolved by chance, it should be much smaller than it actually is.<br />&nbsp;

You&#039;re changing the definition of &quot;religion&quot; to suit your purposes. This does not wash. When you say &quot;religion&quot;, you will be understood by the overwhelming majority of humanity to be talking about specific religious formations, with specific god personalities, that make myriad specific and demonstrably false claims about the nature of existence. You don&#039;t get to conveniently ignore this fact.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I see nothing but confirmation of religious scripture in the face of science.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Of course you don&#039;t, you&#039;re seeing through the eyeglasses of religion.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For instance, the fact that the universe is fine-tuned for the existence of intelligent life is a pretty solidly established scientific fact which demonstrates that it is vastly more probable that our universe is the result of design than chance.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Patently false. You cannot draw conclusions about the math of the universe. All we are able to know is provided to us already by the information of existence. To say that existence implies design is working in the wrong direction. You have tricked yourself into thinking that mathematics equals design. It is our propensity toward patterns and design that reveal the mathematics of the cosmos, not the other way around.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This only reinforces the idea of the existence of a cosmic designer. On scientific grounds alone, belief in God is rationally justified. (This has nothing to do with creationism. The exquisite fine-tuning of the universe is universally accepted in mainstream science.)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is ego, sanctified. You are failing to see that the god you are positing can only mean &#039;all of everything, entirely&#039;, i.e. pantheism, and clearly encompasses both the conscious and unconscious. It is simply unreasonable to assign a singular awareness to the concept of all existence, given these parameters.<br /><br />In addition, let&#039;s revisit again the fact that you are changing the definition of the very concepts you are arguing for. When you say &quot;God&quot;, humanity understands you as vindicating (or vilifying) highly specific personalities and traditions (YHWH/Allah/Jesus/Elohim), yet you use it in a mysterious and purposefully non-specific way. <br /><br />1. To do this is to know that you are being misunderstood by your audience.<br />2. To do this is to admit that all religions are ultimately incorrect about their most dangerous claim–that religion X is the true and exclusive source of all truth<br />3. Religions still still successfully cling to 2 because thinking like yours allows it to do so<br /><br />As I have said before in a different thread, religions have simply rigged the game against themselves. They cannot be the exclusive source of all truth they claim to be and exist in a universe where certain questions cannot be answered using language or even at all.

The fact that you must make this distinction means the religions themselves are ultimately fiction. As long as we allow people who base their thinking upon the unreasonable notion that religion X is non-fiction an equally valued opinion on matters concerning REALITY, we will fail to even begin to address how to go about answering questions of existential importance.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Testability and falsifiability are methodological -- they are not facts about the universe that science has revealed to us.

Except here&#039;s the thing: we can adopt practices for achieving mystical/transcendental experience without leaving the context of scientific thinking. If we cannot answer certain questions yet (or ever), then we LEAVE THEM UNANSWERED until we can figure out a way to answer them reasonably. Religion refuses to do this, which is why it is forever doomed to find itself in conflict with science.

In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!&quot; This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it&#039;s still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything&#039;s going to be all right, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.&quot;

				The thing is , There most be a meaning to life , It is simply not possible that there isnt , In theory its possible , THat it all is there for no reason , But when u go in the deeper picture , Something up there .. is much greater then us ,,, And that my friend , We will know - Or not know , When we go to the next world ? Which might be nothing but numbness and death , Or it might be something we have never expierenced or expected .... Just like many things in life , You know , Sometimes u discover something and you are simply shocked about knowing about it ,,, SO is life , IT will not be known to us , Untill we reach that point ..

				Carl Sagan said &quot;We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.&quot;<br /><br />If this is the truth about life, then the meaning would be to experience life, as much of it as possible. To see, smell, taste, hear and touch everything you can. <br /><br />Or alternatively there is no meaning to life at all. SO you are completely free to make your own meaning, do whatever you desire, choose your own meaning and purpose.

				Life is what you make of it,there is no inherent meaning. The biggest thing in my mind is to remember that death is closer every day and not to waste my precious time here. The average person lives for 28,251 days. If you’re 25 years old, you’re roughly one-third of the way through. Are you happy with the way things are going?&nbsp; <br /><br />On my wall hangs a framed piece of paper with no glass over it. On the paper is a big square divided into tiny blocks — 52 blocks wide, 80 blocks tall. It is called a Memento Mori chart, Memento Mori is latin for : remember that you will die.<br /><br />My birth date is written on the top left corner. The same date, 80 years later, is on the bottom right of the page. With every week that passes, I take a pen and fill in a block.<br /><br />A few weeks ago, I finished the 29th row, my 29th year alive.<br /><br />This is my Memento Mori chart. All the weeks I have lived are in black. All the weeks I hope to live are blank.<br /><br />Every time I look at this, I remember that I am going to die. And that motivates me to live an incredible life.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot; All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no way to escape being separated from them.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; My actions are my only true belongings.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I cannot escape the consequences of my actions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; My actions are the ground upon which I stand.&quot;<br /><br />Those lines above are from the 5 Remembrances of Buddhist philosophy.<br /><br />Here’s what they mean to me: Everything that I have and everyone that I know is going to change, fall apart, and eventually go away. The only thing that matters is how I act right now.<br /><br />That’s why every time I fill in a block on my Memento Mori chart I take a few minutes to consider how I spent my time that week.<br /><br />Did I:<br /><br />…spend it with people I love and care about?<br />…challenge myself?<br />…worry about stupid shit?<br />…do things that made me happy?<br />…try something new?<br /><br />Some weeks I realize I frittered away my time on meaningless stuff. Other weeks I smile as I remember all the cool things I did.<br /><br />But every week, no matter what happened, I think about how I’m creating the story of my life with my actions.<br /><br />And I’ll be damned if I’m gonna write a shitty story.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; Caretake this moment.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Immerse yourself in its particulars.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Respond to this person, this challenge, this deed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quit the evasions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Stop giving yourself needless trouble.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It is time to really live; to fully inhabit the situation you happen to be in now.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; You are not some disinterested bystander.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Exert yourself.&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; - Epictetus

I will be saving your comment in my bank of shit that is useful for helping people wake up to their lives. Our attentions are writing the stories of our lives every second of every minute of every wakeful moment, and they&#039;re doing it with or without the input of self-awareness. As you said, I&#039;ll be damned if I&#039;m going to just let it write a shitty story.

				Many times when I am troubled or confused, I find comfort in sitting in my back yard and having a vodka and cranberry along with a quiet conversation with Jesus. <br /><br />This happened to me again after a particularly difficult day.<br /><br />I said &quot;Jesus, why do I work so hard?&quot;<br /><br />And I heard the reply, &quot;Men find many ways to demonstrate the love they have<br />for their family. You work hard to have a peaceful, beautiful place for your friends and family to gather.&quot;<br /><br />I said: &quot;I thought that money was the root of all evil.&quot; <br /><br />And the reply was, &quot;No, the LOVE of money is the root of all evil. Money is a tool; it can be used for good or bad.&quot;<br /><br />I was starting to feel better, but I still had a burning question, so I asked it. &quot;Jesus,&quot; I said, &quot; What is the meaning of life? Why am I here?&quot;<br /><br />He replied, &quot;That is a question many men ask. The answer is in your heart and is different for everyone. I would love to chat with you some more, Senor, but for now, I have to finish mowing your lawn.&quot;

				On a somewhat more serious note, I take Jesus&#039; statement to heart. He was asked &quot;what is the greatest commandment?&quot; He answered &quot;to love God, and to love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; I interpret &quot;God&quot; to mean this present moment. So I need to love this present moment, and live it to its fullest. Love your neighbor, to me just means the golden rule. As much as possible, treat others the way I want to treated. Beyond that, we live and we die, we might as well make life as interesting as we can.

				Life has no meaning, and the universe is indifferent. It is up to each individual to find meaning and purpose in their own life. Humans are simply one very small aspect of a grand system we call the universe. We came from nothingness and will fade to nothingness once the universe grows cold and decays.The natural state of all matter is entropy, and I find this to be the most eloquent truth there is. <br /><br />

				I ask myself this many times each and every single day.&nbsp; I have no idea what the meaning of life is but I hope at the end time I have a better idea. I probably will and then will realize all the stuff I forgot to do. That&#039;s the story of my life. Must be meaning in there somewhere. IDK&nbsp; :(

				I think it is to find personal virtue, and to give back from to which you came. And through using the resources around us, we create things of value, through this we find personal virtue.
