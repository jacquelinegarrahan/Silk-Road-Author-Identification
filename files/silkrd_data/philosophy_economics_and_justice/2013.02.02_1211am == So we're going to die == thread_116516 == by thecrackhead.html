				and I keep wondering what happens after. The little voice in my head keeps reminding me that at some point I will not be able to wake up. <br /><br />Not being able to wake up seems reasonable but what if we could keep the hard drive with us after death?<br /><br />I was just curious, what do you think happens after?

				same as before your birth... Can the consciousness survive? Did i have it before birth?&nbsp; <br />well the truth is that no one knows and you will only find the answers when you die. or&nbsp; maybe you could ask a fetus maybe he can remember XD

				Hello Self... <br /><br />To your question - my opinion on that changes from time to time (high to high?). i&#039;m pretty sure i&#039;ve been all the way to the edge and looked over more than once and even though i don&#039;t know what happens if you fall/cross/leap over it, i do know i&#039;m not scared because of that. Whereas, on the other hand, if i am asleep and i get that feeling that i can&#039;t wake up it&#039;s quite irritating if not downright scary. <br /><br />However, this is not why i replied to your post. i love your signature. i love it. i want to steal it and use it at work, because there&#039;s a rampant need there for it. i hate the corporation i work for; however, in my bank account i find i need their money there even if they&#039;re evil. ;-) <br /><br />Thanks for the smile...<br />--blue<br /><br />

				A quantitative answer to this question should involves a better understanding of aliens.<br /><br />Saying there is nothing after death is not based on any evidence.<br /><br />The answer depends on two things:<br />1. Whether human beings are designed for some purpose, in which case destruction of the mind would be wasteful.<br />2. Is the physical manifestation of consciousness such that it may retain after death, leaching to some new host.<br /><br />1 - requires aliens to create life on earth.<br />2 - requires aliens for the population of earth to increase without the number of &#039;souls&#039; increasing.<br /><br />As far as the current definition of habitability of a planet goes, given the size of the universe and the distribution of planets in the visible sky, its very unlikely there should not be other alien intelligent life forms.<br />Its in fact extremely odd none have have developed the technology to contact us yet.<br />So either the understanding of the state of planets (based on assumptions that distant suns are burning the same fuel as our sun for example) or of habitability is wrong or there is an unknown effect which makes most of the universe uninhabitable or that there are plenty of aliens around hiding...

				I can give less of a fuck about dying. My only concern is remembering my life. Not remembering is what scares me. Damn, why can&#039;t someone just be like &quot;psstt eyy, Dead guy over here, As you see I still remember to scare people.

				I&#039;m still holding out hope that they&#039;ll invent a way to extract my consciousness and upload it into &#039;the cloud&#039; upon death.<br /><br />barring that, I tend to agree that there will be absolute nothingness.<br /><br />although I have this theory; you know how time dilates in dreams,<br />well I think heaven and/or hell are really just our own consciousness dealing with itself<br />within this extruded dream space -<br />that&#039;s where near death experiences come from,<br />and that&#039;s why people who have lived a good life with minimal regrets feel at ease<br />but those who feel remorse and regret for the way they have lived get stuck in that final split second of guilt before they finally pass on

While it&#039;s quite possible, even likely that life elsewhere in the universe exists and maybe even intelligent life more advanced than our own, going by what we know from Einstein and modern physics and the limitations imposed upon mass traveling at faster than the speed of light makes communication with alien species separated by even a few thousands light years close to impossible. <br /><br />Unless and until physics determines faster than speed of light travel is possible, be it quantum teleportation or some other mechanism, there&#039;s really no conceivable way to think it would be anything but next to impossible. Even just a few thousand light years would mean the almost certainty that one or both intelligent species, calculating evolutionary time frames, would become extinct before two way communication could even be established. Keep in mind that &quot;now&quot; is a relative concept under the nature of spacetime. So to detect an alien life form 1000 light years away would mean that civilization was in existence 1000 years ago. Then think of being on that other alien planet and the same having to apply to detecting communication from earth, that our civilization would have to exist 1000 years ago relative to them. It&#039;s all relative. Now think of how you&#039;d have to compound those years exponentially to establish two way communication. We&#039;d also be confined to the detection of civilizations within the light cone of Earth since any outside of it couldn&#039;t be detected. <br /><br />And that&#039;s just communication. Interstellar travel given the limitations of the speed of light is a whole other ball of wax that makes the almost impossibility of communication even more improbable. Given this limitation, it makes the possibility so mind bogglingly small as to be, for all practical purposes, impossible.

It&#039;s perfectly possible that the universe swarms with life but there&#039;s no way we can ever know or communicate with it. Other stars are impossibly distant, in time as well as space. Relativity explains that time and space are the same thing; I must admit I find it difficult to think of.&nbsp; Imagine if we detected a habitable planet around a star even a few hundred light years away. We could send a ship to colonize it. If we could find a way of accelerating the ship to near light speed ( not forbidden by physics; you just need a motor that can fire long enough) possibly the effects of time dilation could make the journey( on the ship for the colonists) less than a human lifetime( have I got this right? Is this theoretically possible). But back on earth&nbsp; a few hundred years would have passed. Any kind of communication between us and the colony would be nearly impossible.

The problem in practice has always been the energy requirements to get to the speed of light is infinite. Getting even close to the speed of light the energy requirements would still be profound.<br /><br />It&#039;s interesting to contemplate what would happen though as a passenger given special relativity in spacetime. Time would slow down. As you look back at earth time would still be going by like your clock on the ship would. Maybe a little faster if you&#039;re going a little bit slower than the speed of light. Meanwhile looking at the planet in front of you time would be zooming by such that by the time you got there hundreds of years would have gone by.<br /><br />If somehow you could get very close to the speed of light, say by harnessing all the energy in the universe, in the direction you were going you would see the universe contract and you&#039;d see trillions of years go by in a matter of seconds. You&#039;d see exploding supernovas form new protostars, burn bright, turn into red giants and burn out while galaxies merged. After less than two minutes you could even witness the expected end of the universe 100 trillion years from now when the stars burn out from heat death. Fascinating stuff.

So after reading your post I thought maybe they finally found the missing link.<br /><br />So I searched and could not find a thing. Pubmed, psych databases, etc. Google just produces tons and tons of blog claims and psychedelic forums of people repeating Strassman&#039;s claims as fact.<br /><br />The current reasoning is that the enzyme which converts tryptamine to NMT and DMT is not expressed in the pineal gland so there&#039;s really nothing to support Strassman&#039;s contention.<br /><br />If you know differently could you provide a citation?

I smoked too much DMT, I blasted off a bit too but I never saw a god or anything. I just saw electrons and neutrons, bouncing around ruthlessly in a vacuum. I believe that we all shape our own universe. When I close my eyes, the world goes dark. When I cover my ears, there is universal silence. There is nothing but electrons bouncing around without my mind to decipher them, therefore I must be god. Meaning that the universe must actually be empty, because it is just a canvas for whatever I perceive it to be. Meaning, to me, that everything is nothing (the true meaning of nihilism, not to drink 30 beers in a park till you piss yourself..) but what you perceive it to be.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=116516.msg810983#msg810983">Quote from: jpinkman on February 10, 2013, 02:52 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Could you please provide this scientific &quot;proof&quot;?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />I used to live on a farm, and I&#039;ve got to say, when things die just about everything releases. Obviously I don&#039;t have a ph.d in neuroscience but it makes sense to me that everything in your brain would release when you die, just like the rest of your organs. It would explain near death experiences pretty well, taking a journey towards the light to go see god sounds like 90% of the DMT trip reports I&#039;ve read. <br /><br />Again. Not a scientist.

				I can&#039;t even imagine what would happen after death...but there&#039;s got to be more to it than just nothingness.&nbsp; There are so many unknown and such a hugely vast universe and our own consciousness is one of the greatest mindfucks of earth.&nbsp; But that&#039;s may just be optimistic hope<br />Maybe we are here for ~70-80 years and just disappear forever after that...
