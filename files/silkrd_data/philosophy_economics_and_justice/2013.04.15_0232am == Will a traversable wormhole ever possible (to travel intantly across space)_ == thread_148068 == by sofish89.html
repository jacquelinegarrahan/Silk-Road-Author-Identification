				I know that usually a wormhole is associated with time travel but I&#039;m asking more about traveling through space or across space (like a traversable wormhole). For example having a doorway in my house that I could step into and step out somewhere across the world say like Australia.

				You may think that my original answer was abrupt and rude, but I&#039;d prefer to think of it as efficient...<br /><br />I accept that a &#039;traversable wormhole&#039; could (possibly) be theoretically possible but I 100% do not believe that it will ever be possible for humans to use one to travel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Firstly, I do not think that the human species has the longevity to get to a technological point that we could do it, even if it was possible. The universe is a harsh and unforgiving place, and there are too many events, small insignificant perturbations for the universe&#039;s point of view, that would make human existence impossible.<br /><br />Secondly, even if the concept of bending space around to touch itself somewhere else in three dimensional physical space was real (and it very well might not be) the energy required and the physics fo the wormhole would be far outside the abilities of humans to muster.&nbsp; A wormhole connecting different physical locations in 3D space would, IMO, be something on the order of a black hole (perhaps black hole singularities pop out somewhere else in 3D space - who knows?). Warping of space in such a way would also, necessarily, warp time. It&#039;s well appreciated by the general public that a person falling into a black hole would get shredded (spaghettified), but what is less appreciated is that, from the perpective of the person going into th eblack hole, this would NEVER actually happen since time slows down correspondingly so you&#039;d never make it.<br /><br />This brings up the Thirdly. When we read science fiction and think about wormholes, we are thinking about the universe, space, and time as we perceive it. I believe that the nature of reality is far different from our perception. We barely understand quantum mechanics and what it says about reality (understanding is different from modeling and using it&#039;s rules to predict small scale behavior). We really don&#039;t have a true understanding of what space and time really are and what exists when and where. Being able to create a wormhole to use like a train track implies a much too simplistic view of time, location, and reality.<br /><br />That was a less efficient answer to your question.<br /><br />Good point on the DMT by the way, Rainbow Snail ;D<br /><br />

				Wonderful response, cantharidin. I couldn&#039;t have said it better myself. <br /><br />Perhaps someday we&#039;ll have something that allows you to travel like a wormhole would. Maybe an ultra advanced scanner that scans and remembers the position of every single cell in your body. It would then send this information in the form of light to some incredibly advanced 3D printer on an earth-like planet light years away. A being exactly like you would then pop out and do whatever it is that you would do. <br /><br />Maybe you and your 3D printed clone&#039;s neurons could be tethered together like the electrons of a strange metal :P.

				Haha, I&#039;m just imagining. Something like that would probably never exist. It&#039;s total bullshit. We have started 3D printing organs though :P.<br /><br />I just hope that humans do invent something that allows us to travel any sort of meaningful distance in the universe. You&#039;re probably right in saying that humans will not get to that point before our extinction. It&#039;s fun to think about anyways.<br />

Lots of very smart people speculate on what properties a wormhole MIGHT have IF we cold make one, but no one that I&#039;m aware of has a firm theoretical construction for HOW we could actually create one. I&#039;m with you on creating black holes (or whatever size), but I think you&#039;re making a leap to call those a wormhole or claim that anyone knows what happens at the singularity of a black hole.&nbsp; I&#039;m especially skeptical of your statement that a black hole 1 mile in diameter would &#039;have an opening large enough for a person to pass through without being crushed&#039;.&nbsp; A black hole of whatever size (one the mass of our sun would be something like 20 miles in diameter) presumably has a singularity at the center and not any kind of portal. I don&#039;t think anyone would be up for trying to pass through a singularity. The wormhole arguments I&#039;ve seen speculate about stretching the singularity to open and hold open a portal but I&#039;m not aware of any physics that would allow or predict that.<br /><br />Either way, I, too, like to think about stuff like this. There are a ton of good books about physics/quantum physics/cosmology that have appeared since Brian Greene had such success with his String Theory for Laymen&nbsp; books. It is pretty easy to get some really entertaining physics information these days, even if you don&#039;t know mathematics.

				I can&#039;t remember if it was Hawking or someone else whose mathematical modeling determined that transit through a black hole (&quot;through&quot; here indicating missing that ultra-dense central matter that is warping spacetime) would be impossible if the black hole were not rotating but possible if it were rotating. And I think stationary (ie: not pulsating), rotating black holes are standard theory now, though my reading is woefully out of date.<br /><br />Hard to even guess what physics will permit in 1000 years or 100,000, if there is any descendant of humanity left to find out. I would expect products from grand unification alone to look like magic to us now, and if 12-dimensional theory really is the elegant solution, who knows what kind of mischief we could get up to.<br /><br />But where are all the Boltzman Brains at? I saw we begin time channel attacks on the nature of reality immediately.

				To me, a total layman, this conversation is missing the more feminine possibilities.&nbsp; Ideas of physically moving our meatbodies through spacetime...I wonder if it would be more a process/jouney for our consciousness and not so much for our bodies, and would that make it any less real.&nbsp; Like astral travelling (DMT!!! ;p ), leaving your body wherever it&#039;s lying and exploring the universe with your consciousness.&nbsp; I don&#039;t have much experience with this besides the odd lucid dream but I&#039;ve heard of people visiting places and seeing things that are actually happening in other places.&nbsp; Reality only exists on the screens of our perception and experience anyways so isn&#039;t that where you&#039;d expect to find it&#039;s deepest secrets.&nbsp; I wonder if we could be a lot more powerful wit a little bit more focus...(HA!!&nbsp; I&#039;m so just saying that to myself right now...love how reality is also just a mirror.)<br />As far as actually getting our physical bodies doing this?&nbsp; Well if you consider the spaces within atoms, and accept that all matter is just vibration, than I don&#039;t see why we couldn&#039;t learn to slip through those spaces...<br />Food for thought if nothing else...
