				Im wondering how many people and how much money did they get if they took everything that was in SR, all money?<br /><br />And how many did see this robbery coming from the real criminals thats makin the rules for you smalltime-gangsters to follow?<br /><br />Did they get all the money is probaby a silly question since if they did not get all the money then they probably would not have done it like this, and there is probably legitimate reasons for using SR also like buying pornvideos and stolen creditcards hahahahaaa no im just jokin hahahaaa ofcourse karma is a universal law and if you do shit to others that you would not like if it was done to you.. Then you got some karma to pay back and thats just the truth.<br /><br />Whats next folks?<br /><br />Can we get another SR-type of website that only got vendors that provides services for truthsharing anonymously on a global scale?<br /><br />Like the vendors and costumers saying -noway, no more wars, we have had enough and we will use our fiatmoney to inform everyone because its best for all of us as humanity.<br /><br />I can say that I would use most of the fiatmoney I got to spread info if some vendors just enabled the service that enables anonymous people to pay to be involved in a global awakening.<br /><br />What do you think about this?

				Sounds good.<br />There is a member of parliament George Galloway who is creating documentary to be released in cinema solely on crowdfunding, it will be about the crimes of former PM Tony Blair, And will awaken lots of people and hopefully get him tried in the Hague for war crimes.<br /><br />Maybe Americans could do something similar for former President Bush?<br />crowdfund via bitcoin, get in touch with directors, producers and pay them via that..<br />I&#039;m sure the people with media skills among us would also donate their services for free too.<br />

				I say lets cut the head of the&nbsp; snake by starting a new site that focuses on spreading info thru letters..<br /><br />I say Btc is the key that enables anonymity when it comes to where your money is placed and what info is sent out.<br /><br />I would most defenetiy use all my fiatmoney to push letters exposing the truths of the war on drugusers and its negative&nbsp; effects on the rest of society, for all of us and not because I care about what drugs you do or anything like that.. I just feel thats its not logical when heroin is easy to order while beers can be tough to get when youre underage.<br /><br />I had a couple of friends that died from the war on drugs and I would like the war to stop because of all the victims of the war on drugs. In their honor I say lets be adults and use Btc and a SR-type of market to get infospreading popular.<br /><br />Thats what they all would have wanted us to do, use Btc and the online anonimity to create world peace instead of waiting for people to get informed by lookin it up on the internet.<br /><br />I say when the internetpeople figures out a way to share info from the internet with all the tv-watchers, then we have a global change and that global change will come as soon as we gets it going and enables the service of sending letters filled with truths.. I say we already have Btc and SR-types of sites so what are we waiting on? <br /><br />Get that service provided before the beast gets going and collapses the economy that makes all money worthless?<br /><br /><br />You know what I said like 2 weeks ago that the beast are moving forward with the plans of a one world government, and now the beast shut down SR like it was nothing.. To much writing about using SR and Btc to end wars, instaclose said lucifer who wants the wars to keep going.<br /><br />

				The worldeconomy is about to crash and its no secret..<br /><br />You &quot;might&quot; not get anything in return since the economy might be crashed and people will be out in the streets eating people in 1-2 weeks because they dont know that naure provides all the foods they want even when the economy collapses.<br /><br />People that think the fiatmoney is what life is all about, will get their corebelifs about life totaly crushed when the economy crashes like it is going to and its nothing we can do about it since it was not a real economy anyways and it had buildt-in inflasion that makes money less valuble continuesly until it crashes or the slaves gets informed about the slaveconomy and why its not a real economy.<br /><br />I dont know if you still think it is love to ignore the evidences infront of our eyes and act like slavery and this beated-up planet will continue forever.. But i say its twisted around like everything else.<br /><br />Real love is not being quiet slave until the economy collapses, real love is telling the slaves they are slaves until hey read about how the economy works and then they will know why the few get richer while most people get lesser and lesser of slaveprivileges.<br /><br />I got love for you so I will not act like the economy, slavery or even this planet will be more then a cold desert in a few years because of the ignorance of the slaves that will never end slavery since they think the future is in slavery and transhumanism since the slavemaster aliens still need some human heads to go on the robotbodies for continual slavepurposes and ofcourse you will get provided oils and everything to keep your robotbody going so you can be a slave until they dont need you then they can just shut off the robotbody and &quot;put you in the closet&quot; for possible use in the future..<br /><br />Let me say that some human slaves are just to dumbed down to be saved and they will do anything to transform themselves into robots since they think thats the bright future of succesfull continual slavery.<br /><br />Get right or get whiped basicly. This is no videogame, this is the real game of life and you aint playing it very well yet.

				So when are we going to pick up the controller and start playing the game of life?<br /><br />Where are the peacefighters when we want a new marketplace where people can pay for truths to be sent to people homes instead of waiting for people to get the knowledge we could just send them the knowledge in the same way that vendors sent drugs all over the globe?<br /><br />They say cannabis cures cancer, well I say lets send all that science to all homesadresses in a country and let the people deside based on that science if cannabis, if the cannabis is a working medecine against cancer or what is working against cancer..<br /><br />I know alot of goodhearted stoners would pay a vendor to send that into to all homes in a area.<br /><br />This is clearly FBI and CIA mockin you all and robbing drugusers since they know we aint going to use our fiatmoney to pay a vendor to print and send truthfilled letters to all homes in a country.. But they dont like the writing about it in the forums since the dont want us to pick up the controller and start informing everybody about their unjust ways of going to war against people and robbing people..<br /><br />They probably know what BTC and places like SR could be used for if used right and they dont wanna risk messing up their murderattemt of 90% of the population =(<br /><br />And it all stops as soon as we know where to put the fiatmoney for the letters to start flowing until everyone is imformed thru printed letters..<br /><br />They cant play the game if the people can pay fiatmoney to get everyone informed about important stuff without even askin the media about whats important to tell the people since they have failed alot for example they have never informed the public about keyissues like chemtrails and modern slavery/slaveconomy.<br /><br />That would be like telling FBI and CIA to stay in their places and dont rob innocent people because they wanna keep fighting a unjust war by robbing and allowing daily murderings because of the war on drugs and the high prices that is brings by makin the dealers rich by takin risks of going to jail when handeling the product.<br /><br />I say lets get a bunch of vendors together and lets start printing letters and using a new kind of marketplace that focuses on services like infosharing thru letters..<br /><br />As soon as the letters start flowing anonymously the FBI and CIA would back off since they could never arrest everyone on the planet if everyone admited to druguse toay there would not be any rom in the prisons , we would not fit since we are to many..<br /><br />They wanna promote fear and specially now when I was writing about getting this Btc and Sr directed at ending wars instead f being a part of it.. They probably cant handle it since the beast knows what Btc and SR could do if used to inform populations.<br /><br />Its just sad that Sr had to go but it would probably not be hard either to have a marketplace that confirms that if they shut it down it will reopen soon but in another location. <br /><br />I get the feeling that maybe SR, btc and TOR is owned by the CIA and FBI and used to collect info for 2+ years, since who could make rules like that on a anonymous hidden website without the site being able to reopen with a exact copy on the marketplace and all stats and money?<br /><br />It cant have been much files to keep a copy of either right?<br /><br />Whats you view on my views?
