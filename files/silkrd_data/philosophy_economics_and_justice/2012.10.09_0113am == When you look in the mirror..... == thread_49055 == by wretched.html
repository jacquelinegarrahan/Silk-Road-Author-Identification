				While tripping, what do you see? <br /><br />I don&#039;t ever see the same person that is in the pictures hanging in the hallways of my house, or even the man on my driver&#039;s license. I see a combination of the people who I have known over the years. Most recently (yesterday) I saw the eyes of a long long lost friend of mine. I haven&#039;t seen this person in over 15 years, and haven&#039;t spoken to them in probably 10, but his eyes are what was in the mirror looking back at me yesterday. kind of freaked me out. I don&#039;t know if this is the right category for this, maybe it belongs in off topic, but I am curious if this is only me who sees everyone but himself in the mirror while tripping...that is all.

				I usd to live in constant dissociation with my body.<br />Detached and depersonalized, I was out of my mind but not attached to anything.<br /><br />I didn&#039;t &quot;see&quot; anyone in there.<br /><br />But when I trip, I can see my real being underneat it all (tripping feels like it cured my detachedness.. but really it was myself and hardwork with some tripping) and I always find myself trying to find others who are being real, or can &quot;see&quot;.<br />Like, constantly.<br />Looking into others eyes, I&#039;m like &quot;IS ANYONE THERE D:&quot;<br />And you see some people putting on these giant shows, and you look into their eyes and see how they&#039;re afraid but they&#039;re in there.<br />And I look into my eyes. I mean, I see a being... I guess.<br /><br />I wrote this today: <br /><br />&quot;Everyone around me is striving for something, yet I&#039;m just striving to understand why they do so and why I want to know so. <br />What the heck does that make me.&quot;<br /><br />I just see someone very different from the rest...<br /><br />I feel so bad for being so fake for so long though, it feels good to be liberated.<br />&quot;awakened&quot;.<br />

				When I used to eat and sell a lot of LSD,&nbsp; I spent parts of many trips hanging out for a bit in front of a bathroom mirror. <br /><br />I would usually be blown away by the detail. One time i remember i could just see how my flesh, the muscle underneath it, and my bone structure all made up head. I felt like i could see my bone structure in such detail i was imagining what my skull would look like on its own. None of this was &#039;bad&#039; or &#039;dark&#039;, it was very intriguing. <br /><br />Another time, I couldn&#039;t help but notice the primate-like features in my face. I couldn&#039;t unsee the facial characteristics of being a half-bald primate with a more developed frontal-lobe. It was a good reminder that we&#039;re animals. We&#039;re just animals that have taken ways of living and surviving and try to make it more effeceint, we adapt to our environment not physically, but subjectively. <br /><br />And I think that&#039;s pretty cool.

				I don&#039;t see anything, just what&#039;s behind me. Of course I am a vampire and I haven&#039;t taken the cure for it yet. Gotta get my alchemy skills up and mix the right potion.

				theres an old Buddhist (i think?)&nbsp; tradition of when u look in the mirror u should say simply &quot;who?&quot; n this supposedly subconciously asks u more about urself leading to actualization... i found about that when i was roughly 16 and carried on til about 19 these were the ages before life got colder n a lot harder. when i trip i see that young version of me w a mix of who i am now, just a whole lot more happier whilst tripping w that cheeky smile plastered on my face...<br /><br />but then im kinda new to proper acid n it is a beautiful one

Thank you for writing about that.<br /><br />When I look in the mirror while tripping I see myself without that image of myself I have in my head. Like I would look at me for the first time. I can see how other people really see me. And then came realizations, thoughts what I do wrong, what should I change. And positive things about myself, I often forget about. It&#039;s really interesting experience, and I love doing this (I saw devil face as my face on high dose of LSD and it was great -- I understood something deep about my personality).

				The last time I tripped, my hair was rather long and I was growing my goatee out. When I looked in the mirror, I thought, &quot;I am dog-man.&quot; I&#039;m not sure why I thought that, but the image and phrase are burned into my memory.
