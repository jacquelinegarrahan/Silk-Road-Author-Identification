				Title: <strong>The cause of cancer</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I was one of them who was walkin around saying that cannabis cures cancer, but after reading about the cause and cure for cancer, I realised that cannabis is not the cure, it just helps to fight the cause of cancer.<br /><br />84 years ago a german got nobelprize for finding out that cancer cant survive in a alkaline body, in other words people who eat living fruit and veggies can&#039;t get sick since their immunesystem works, and all modern diseases comes from humans eating dead foods.<br /><br />We basicly need the lifeforce in the plants we eat to keep our blood alkaline and when its alkaline it can hold alot of oxygen, when its not alkaline it can hold much oxygen and the immunesystem starts to be sick and thats when people get sick.<br /><br />The nobelprize-guy found this out by switching the blood in a cancerpatient to a alkaline blood so cancer can easily be removed ba alkalizing your body by eating living fruit and veggies, or if the cancer is really serious they could change the blood in the body using a machines to save time.<br /><br />Sp please folks, dont walk around saying that cannabis cures cancer, I have heard people saying they dont have to care about what they eat since they can just smoke cannabis if they get cancer. And thats not posetive since they can eat themselves to cancer kinda easy.<br /><br />Lack of sleep, stress and worry all helps to keep the Ph-leve of the blood down and cannabis helps with those.<br /><br />So basicly cannabis helps to cure cancer but it is not the cure fr cncer since ifit was the cure fr cancer then the cause of cancer would be the lack of cannabis in peoples lungs and that is not the truth.<br /><br />Kinda funny to see this lie being so popular now, since how are they going to say that cannabis helps to cure cancer while they want money from people to be able to look for the cure they have already found 84 years ago.<br /><br />Cannabis, vitamin b17, fruit and veggies.. The list is kinda long of tings that helps to cure cancer but the truth is that it is the Ph-level of the blood that causes you to get cancer if you dont eat some living fruit and veggies once in a while.<br /><br /><br />Let me tell you what I eat since i eat pizzatasing sandwitch that is able to cure cancer and all diease just by being alkaline rawfood.<br /><br />I mix cucumber, tomato, carrot, spinash, onion and some pizzaspices.. Then I spread the mix on some thin dark bread. So there you have it folks, the cure for cancer and all disease is rawfoods and its possible to make the rawfood taste like pizza.<br /><br />Good luck and take care!

				I&#039;ve never heard anyone claim cannabis cures cancer. I&#039;d have remembered on the grounds I&#039;d have knocked their teeth out so nobody takes them serious in the future.<br /><br />Cannabis is excellent for dealing with the physical pains of cancer, relieving the nausea of chemo/radiotherapy, and (I guess) for taking your mind off the fact you&#039;re rapidly shuffling off the mortal coil to face an eternity of oblivion.<br /><br />PS, Roy Castle tried to fight cancer with raw foods. He even wrote a book called Raw Energy. He died of his cancer though.

				They even get cannabis to treat cancer in the USA according to some of the new weedprograms on Discovery Channel.. <br /><br />Even Chong and SilkRoad are promoting cannabis as the cure for cancer.<br /><br />They say Chong is proof of the cure for cancer, I say its the opposite since Chong got cancer while he smoked cannabis every day since 50 years back.

				You cant continue eating at McDonalds if you got cancer since you will kill yourself and cannabis will NEVER cure cancer unless you know the cause of cancer,.<br /><br />If cannabis was the cure then the cause would be the lack of weed..<br /><br />Please dont keep repeating the bullshit about the cure for cancer is cannabis since that can kill people, I have alreadyy heard people saying that they can just smoke cannabis if they get cancer.<br /><br />They found the cause and cure for cancer 84 years ago.<br /><br />The only thing they have noticed is that less stoners get cancer then normal people, that is not a good way to find a cure since you ignored the cause.<br /><br />The cause of cancer is when you lowering your Ph-level of the blood makin it unable to hold oxygen and thats when cancer and all other disease appere..<br /><br />humans aint designed to eat dead foods since we aint scavangers, we are herbavores and in nature we was pickin and peeling the fruits with our hands.<br /><br />Having machines killing animals so we can eat them is destroying the planet and people since they are getting cancer.<br /><br />And the radiation is rising in the solarsystem so the cancer will get more and more common and it will go faster and faster.<br /><br />Okey so now you dummies got the instructions on how to cure all disease, none of you will probably do it and only the strong will survive this attacks from air, water and food since we are in te middle of WW3 right now and it will end with the apocalypse with zombies and everything since most of humanity will devolve and become cannibal neadertahl zombies while a small part of humanity evolves and get superpowers, then its on folks, massive war on this planet but this time the good side will win since thats just how it is when higher powers are at work..<br /><br />Take care now and we will meet again..

				I aint here to discuss youre belifs and that you trust the slaveowners to give a slave the right info..<br /><br />Google it if you want to know if the school lied to you about what design the human body is.<br /><br />The chicken is a slave for humans and so is the pigs and cows.. And humanity are slaves to aliens controlling the fakeconomy and karma is a universal law.<br /><br />In other words you can never ever be free unless you let animals be free.<br /><br />You so dumb you probablythink youre free because the slaveowners always tells the truth. =(<br /><br />Its wrong when &quot;the smartest&quot; herbavore on the planet is dumbed down enough to believe she is a omnivore..<br /><br />The hawk is doing what the hawk is designed to do, humans are not pickin and peeling fruits with the hands.. We use our hands to build machines that can kill animals behind closed doors so we can eat the tortured animals afterwards when they are chopped up in pieces and put into a bag.<br /><br />Eating animals would not be so fun if you had to kill the animal youself, and thats the voice of the most high you are feeling..<br /><br />The most high did not write bibles or korans, the most high designed feeling inside you that tells you right from wrong.<br /><br />Thats why is says in the bible that god wants humans to eat animals and get cancer since he is confused on the design of the human body he created.<br /><br />In the koran it says humans can kill animals IF they do it in the name of the most high, the creator of the human herbavore bodydesign.<br /><br />Good luck following youre religions / anti-christ but you are christ so you should probably get out of there before they start anti yourself.

				Its amazing how many people are still asleep in the first world countries (US, Australia, UK, Canada, Europe, etc) and have no idea that corporations run the world, that money and profit is everything to these companies and that people are nothing more than a consumer who can pay for items, provide labour and then get send off to a lousy retirement. <br /><br />Cancer is a lifestyle disease! If you eat processed junk, drink water with fluoride, never eat raw veg or fruit and avoid the sun and use sun screen, you WILL get cancer 99.9% in your life time. Since USA has launched the War On Cancer (like war on aids, drugs and terror) cancer rates have sky rocketed! A cancer patient brings on average around $300,000 to the cancer industry. There are more people working for the cancer industry than people dying of it. <br /><br />There have been 100s of proven cheap cures for cancer but were all suppressed by the FDA and US government. <br /><br />Vitamin B17, raw vegan diet, juicing raw organic fruit and veg, Gerson Therapy, hemp oil are all very cheap ways to cure cancer. But people are lazy and close minded so they believe everything the TV idiot box tells them, the news and their local doctor who has no idea what health is, doctors at your local clinic only treat symptoms, never addressing the cause. <br /><br /><br />The same applies to oil companies, petrol cars, expensive electricity... it&#039;s very possible to run cars on electricity, water and for nearly nothing! Its also possible to have free energy in your home right now, Google Nikola Tesla, but the US government has suppressed this as well. If it cant make any money to corporations, then it will never be released.<br /><br />Money rules this world under our governments. greed and money. <br /><br />Open your mind, psychedelics are great for that, mushrooms, acid and mescaline, they make you question the authority and the world we live in, this is why they are illegal. <br />&nbsp;

				Money and profit is not the reason since they own the banks and all the money because of it..<br /><br />The psycadelics are illegal because you get a taste of what your third eye can do, in other words those drugs give you a taste of what being a sungod really is.. And they cant have it since they are not sungods and we will burn the shit out of them with our pineal gland, the seat of the soul they call it.<br /><br />Money and questioning governments is kinda one dimensional when this is really layers on&nbsp; layers but the trut is that they are aliens and they have ensalved humanity thruu a fakeconomy and they want you to think they are humans who is only caring about money, but they are not since they dont care about anything exept killing humanity to get some cheap and easy human meats.<br /><br />

Or it it made me dumb enough to eat other humans just because they looked like a pig on the outside.<br /><br />And the pig also proves that it was created thru GMOtechnology in labs waaaay before you think that that was possible since you think gMO is kinda new when its really millions of yeas old but we are controlled by a alien race that lets us get a gradualy better technology all the time just so people continue running in the hampsterwheel to be able to buy the &quot;newest&quot; technology products continuesly..<br /><br />Weed removes something from you, I thought it was bloodsuger but I hear some doctors say it kills melanin..<br /><br />

				Thats pure bullshit when they say diseases are inherited since that means there is never ever a cure, and to say there is no cure when you have a immunesystem is like saying -wtf is a crappy immunesystem? Give me some pills!<br /><br />Immunesystems makes us immune as long as the blood has alot of oxygen in it, cannabisfarmers know how important the Ph-level of the water you give plants is, humans are walking trees.. not talkin monkeys.<br /><br />Some of you are talkin monkeys tho and you fully believe humans came from monkeys yet the truth is that we was created in a lab by aliens from higher dimensions.<br /><br />There is a video on youtube called: the cure for all disease.&nbsp; or something like that. it explains it if you wanna know more just search for it on youtube to see it.

				If a &quot;god&quot; thinks he cant cure diseases even tho she have something called a immunesystem, then the god is in trouble since the god is creating this world thru her mind and a uncurable disease could be created if a god thought that was true that some dieases cant be cured in a god that is really above this lowest dimension controlled by the beasts soul-less aliens.<br /><br />We created this dimension and the aliens and then we sent ourselves into this hologram, and right now we are just a small part of ourself and our higher self is in a higher dimension waiting for us to make it out of this hellhole alive so we can unite and becaome whole again.<br /><br />Kinda like a videogame, we are a small part of our higher self basicly and we are playing this game of life in the hologram we created and we have a multidimensional soul that enables us to visit the &quot;other side&quot; where our higher self is at.<br /><br />to many people are noobs at playing the game of life tho and they will be stuck in the hologram when our goal was really to get the fuk out of this dimension after we have learnet what we should from this &quot;test&quot; or theese &quot;evildoers&quot; that we really created a long time ago to &quot;test ourselves&quot; by sending s amll part of ourself into the hologram to loose our memories and get tricked by some evildoers and then try to manage to get out or stay until we gets it and can get out.

				And I probably should say that Im not a alien from this lowest dimension since they dont have souls most of them here bcause they dont get karma and stuff yet, according to my calculation the indiigochildren, crystalchildren and rainbowchildren all came from higher dimensions just now to live one life..<br /><br />Normal humans also come from higher dimenions where everyone innerstand karma but humans have been here for 26 000 years at least living short lives and doing the same bullshit and ignoring karma..<br /><br />The indigos just came here to like &quot;show a new way&quot; since there was a call that was sent out to the universe about humans having fuked it up for themselves totaly, and a few brave alienssouls gave up their lives they had just to come here and help humanity get out of the deep hellhole they let themselves get into by ignoring slavery and envorimental destruction.<br /><br />the indigos was gonna change the system but them got manipulated thru the vaccines and now the indigos mission is to help people thru the rebirth, at least, this is what i feel. But I have not met my higher self and the guides that is helping humanity in the spiritual world.<br /><br />But i also hear that indigos have their higher self guiding them thru life since indigos are dominated by the right side of the brain, in other words the hart dominates what theydo always. And its even more so with the crystal and rainbowchildren.<br /><br />You should probably look it up online what indigos often act like since you might be one also and your not special because of it you just have gotten a gift by having your DNa partly activated when you was born, so you dont age as others do and you feel what others are meaning instead of hearing the words for example.. Its telepathy and its hard to lie to people who got telepathic powers and I really got some weird telpathic stuff since I feel the meanings behind word I dont see the words sometimes and people be like wtf i lead so good why did not he fall for it hahahahaa<br /><br />Thats the mainreason why i dont have alot of friends also since the freinds i had was not real friends since they would lie and sell a friend for 10 dollars if they got the chance, even if you grew up with them and you should not hang out with people that does not treat others as they wish to be treated by others since they will drag you down into karmacreating..<br /><br />Indigos dont like crowds of peopl and they feel uncomftable in growds and I do, probably because all the energies from all disgusting assholes walkin around hehe. Im not bothered by it but I avoid it anyway.<br /><br />Like i said most of the indigos came in the 80&#039;s so if you feel like it might be you then look it up online since you got some more powers then the rest of the people on the planet because of the activated DNA, we will all get our DNA activated if we eat livving fruit and veggies and clears our karma and avoid poisons in foods and water and have a activated third eye and wrokin merkaba, since we are going thru the sun and I think people will be pulled into the sun in 2020 and if you have not crystalized on the inside then you will burn instead of going thru the sun and into the 5th dimension and the paradise on the new Earth.<br /><br />I say people should at least talk with the people aroun them that they care about and if they are open about things like this, they probably not but you would still tell people that there is a shark in the water before people takes a bath where the shark swimms, and its the same with this.<br /><br />I know that if veryone did what i do , just talked to the ones they can reach, then things would change and people would make it thru to the new Earth and the world would most defenetily change if people took responsibility of talkin with the ones they can reach about the evidences and truths that is avalible online like cancercures and cause and stonemonuments the aliens put up telling humanity they gonna kill90% of humanity since people who think they are talkin monkey will not make it since none will make it unless they gets help from higher realms and their higher selfs.<br /><br />i would recommend to all that you write down that you wanna meet your higher self and that will make it happen.<br /><br />and write down that you wanna astral travel also and meet the guides that is there to help us. like the Oracle in the matrix movies.

				Guys he is right.&nbsp; My sister was a paraplegic after getting into a car accident and hasn&#039;t been able to walk for years.<br /><br />I told her that being vegan and smoking lots of weed cures cancer, maybe it can help her walk again soon.&nbsp; So three days later she&#039;s up and now she is training for a marathon!

				I kind of feel that an &#039;indigo&#039; (if such a thing existed) child, being gifted with a higher consciousness and special powers, would not use the phrase &quot;hahaha your a fuken dumbass&quot; quite so often. But maybe being a foul mouthed ranting delusional&nbsp; illiterate is what being an indigo is all about.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indigo isn&#039;t even a colour. The spectrum of light has the colours blending into each other with no dividing lines. But if you look at a rainbow you will see the last two colours are blue and purple . Isaac Newton inserted indigo in there to make the spectrum have an analogy with the musical octave: seven notes seven colours. Even great geniuses have their little foibles. But having lots of little foibles does not make you a genius. Yucky.<br /><br />(I like to feel I provide cordon bleu troll food)

				Myself I create DMT, melatonin and seratonin with my pineal gland, great vs depressions since seratonin is what weedsmokin makes your pineal create and it makes you feel good..<br /><br />Youre welcome to continue using drugs to get DMT and seratonin from your pineal gland. That melatonin would be&nbsp; usefull tho since the protection from radiation is about to get lifted from the Earth and people will burn, specially those who did not care so much about their bodies. =(<br /><br />Its a human BBQ going down when the protection is lifted and it has began being lifted now.<br /><br />Get ready to survive or get ready to burn up.<br /><br />Take care now

				What&#039;s funny is that I agree with RogerPantade... the humanity is so asleep that its no wonder they rely on drugs to get them through their miserable existence. No one ever seems to ask &quot;why is life so cruel&quot;? The ones that do, often go on a self discovery which can take years to see the whole big picture. <br /><br />Ever ask yourself why and how were the Egyptian pyramids build TOP TO BOTTOM thousands of years ago when people supposedly had no &quot;technology&quot;? Or why does the Eye of the Chorus looks exactly like the human pineal gland? Or what really happened to the people of Atlantis? <br /><br />In comparison, modern humans are primitive greedy apes compared to the Egyptians and the Atlantis people... they had free energy back then, we have oil companies and the bankers keeping us locked into the vicious circle of greed and hate. Ever wonder why such things like War on Drugs exists in the first place?? Or War on Terror? It&#039;s because the people above the government really want to enslave us slowly but surely.&nbsp; <br /><br />visit this site for some info: http://www.thegreaterpicture.com/<br /><br />

The Eye of Horus:<br />CLEARNET<br />http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Eye_of_Horus_bw.svg<br /><br />The pineal gland:<br />CLEARNET<br />http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/otherendo/pinealgland.jpg<br /><br />B) Even IF it did (and I guess maybe it could do if you turn your head and squint) it wouldn&#039;t be exactly impossible since the Eye of Horus is an Egyptian creation, and the Egyptians are famous for removing all kinds of organs from dead bodies, including the brains which were removed through the nose, so they may well have known what a pineal gland looked like and decided that that was Horus&#039; eye...<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Or what really happened to the people of Atlantis?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I would first need some much better evidence that Atlantis actually existed (eg, any evidence) before I started to ponder this.

They didn&#039;t have free energy, they had thousands of slaves. They didn&#039;t have some magical juju that ran their empire, they enslaved people. The Egyptian Pharisees were ALL about greed, a hubris which I believe played a significant factor in their downfall. We are primitive greedy apes, no doubt, but ancient people (real ones at least - mythological ones can be however you want them of course) were no less primitive greedy apes.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">visit this site for some info: http://www.thegreaterpicture.com/</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This website is filled with disingenuous bullshit (I just had a browse). I cannot possibly comment on all of it, so I will just point out one typical piece:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">For the Great Pyramid of Giza 2.3 million stones were used, that, altogether weighed some 14.3 billion pounds. The top deviates less than 2 inch from the center of the more than 60,000 yd2 square base. This top is located at 29,9792458 degrees north latitude, referring precisely to the speed of light (299792458 meters per second)</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What?! But the measurements of degrees, meters, and seconds are all completely arbitrary. If you gave the same figures in radians (a much more common form of radial measurement) miles and hours you would find that the numbers do not match up so well.

				Lol humanity is already enslaved and invaded by aliens controlling the politicians and mediapeople like handpuppets..<br /><br />How the economy works is whats creates modern slavery and the ones in power just wanna kill you to be honest since they dont have a soul and they want you to not care about yours so you loose it and gets stuck in this lowest dimension to repeat short miserable lives for some tousand of years more.<br /><br />We are sungods and we are supposed to rise above this animal kingdom and lowest dimension where the beast makes the rules.<br /><br />The economy is going down and this have been talked about for a long time since a economy like it is not supposed to stand. Its time to get ready basicly and activate that third eye since you dont really need to be eating people when the economy crashes and the foods stop comin in to the stores.<br /><br />We are going thru the underworld to get to heaven and portals will open for the righteous ones in 3-4 years and they will close in 2020 and thats wen I think people gonna get sucked into the sun thats inside the planet and if they not right on the inside they will burn up instead of comin to the new Earth in the 5th dimension.<br /><br />So get that third eye going folks and remember economy will crash you cant get your money the banks says it themselves that if everyone was trying to get their money out at the same time they could not since there is not that much paper in the banks.<br /><br />Leave the animals alone and mother Earth might leave you alone. Its gonna get hot.<br /><br />
