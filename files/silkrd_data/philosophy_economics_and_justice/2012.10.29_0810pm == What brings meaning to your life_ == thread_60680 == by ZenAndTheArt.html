				For me, it has always been about friendship.&nbsp; <br />Don;t worry i am not pulling off some star trek emotional bullshit.<br />Making people happy genuinely makes you friends and i seem to be pretty good at in rl.&nbsp; It makes me personally happy to make others happy, albeit to laugh and share.<br /><br />As for the one who said there is no god, i think that is an unfair statement to make.<br />Some people need religion in their lives in order to move on.&nbsp; It is not neccessarily their choice either, but their upbringing.&nbsp; So i would hate on that too much.<br />Having said that, i do despise cults.&nbsp; Because 9 times out of ten they are run by self obsessed nutters who just want to manipulate people for their own ends.<br />And before anyone says thats the same as religion in general, have a good think before you make that statement. 8)

				Hard to encapsulate such an answer in a word.&nbsp; After living a good portion of my life, and experiencing much of what being alive is, (being born, being a child, growing up, being a man, having a family, losing friends, losing family, enduring injury, poverty, ill health, and on and on..) I have learned a few lessons, but the most important of these is to be compassionate.&nbsp; After losing friends and family, you see the things that are lost and you see the things that endure.&nbsp; How you treat your children, your wife, your friends echoes long into the future.&nbsp; Even how you treat the clerks at your grocery store, the idiot who rear-ended your car, your dog, your garden, your tools seems to endure.<br /><br />So, the one word.<br /><br />Compassion

				probably shouldn&#039;t post this but wtf.&nbsp; used to think that ending poverty and social injustice was meaningful.&nbsp; then perhaps raising a famlly would give reason to get put of bed in the morning.&nbsp; To reach the stars is another.&nbsp; Be a long time til the first people being as they are and even so - means nothing in this infinite multiverse.&nbsp; No kids for me as my partner had some and was sterilised before we met and then when trying to do that elsewhere i got a different present instead.&nbsp; The third is not in my lifetime and amyway is a crock of shit - see #1.&nbsp; Getting by through Buddhist ideas sort of works best as far as i can see - travelling to new places distracts for a while.<br /><br />day to day I get out of bed to work so i don&#039;t get homeless and hungry.&nbsp; Days like today and yesterday are meaningless.&nbsp; Guess what: Ive had no H today ( Monday ) or yesterday - don&#039;t want a physical habit.&nbsp; Saturday was a meaningful day.

				You define your meaning. Find your own purpose and the good things which makes you really happy in life. We are here to experience. To learn. It&#039;s a gift to live. If someone doesn&#039;t wanna live anymore he just can suicide and move on. We have this option. Otherwise we were immortals. Death is the end of this life but every end is a new begging in eternity.<br /><br /><br /><br />Personally, my driving force is Music. I love music since I was a child, and I&#039;ll make music till the day I die.

				The thread said that i should describe my meaning of life with one word. For me it would be : Knowledge<br />I&#039;ve been a staff of a hacking forum for a long time and that&#039;s kinda the reason what keeps me getting up in the morning and motivates me because i&#039;ve seen that there are so few people who has knowledge on that and are sharing it and i like feel that&#039;s my responsibility to share what i know. I&#039;m learning as much as i can and will share it with others who would like to learn. Actually i&#039;m even in this forum to acquire new knowledge, but that&#039;s more like my personal interest. I&#039;m kinda interested in the deep web and always have been, never just had time for it. :)<br /><br />Some people are discussing about religion. In my forum i don&#039;t mention any word about religion because no matter what you&#039;re going to say, there&#039;s still some people who disagree with it. When people are asking ; &quot;Are you an Atheist?&quot;, i&#039;ll just answer ; &quot; Atheist is an person who doesn&#039;t belive in existence of god and is claiming that god isn&#039;t real, i&#039;m not claiming that god isn&#039;t real. They might be real, but they&#039;ve never gave me any reason to belive in them.&quot;.Luckily i don&#039;t have to talk about religion often. :)

				The Alan Watts quote &quot;You are the Universe experiencing itself&quot; really resonates with me. To me, the meaning is to gain as much experience as you can while in this life. That is one of the reasons I enjoy experimenting with psychedelics and other consciousness altering substances. I think that there is so much wonder that it would be a shame to have wasted the opportunity to have these experiences. Buy the ticket, take the ride. Be excellent to each other. Live an authentic life and I think you&#039;ll be heading down the right path.

				&quot;Because I, personally, have no fear of death. Now sure I may have appropriate degrees of fear for events leading to death, as they&#039;re usually unpleasant, but I have no fear of dying at all. I know I&#039;m not the only one.&quot;<br /><br />I believe you do but simply do not realize it, most people do not until they really examine the topic, I know I didn&#039;t. And I don&#039;t mean to offend or say you a wrong here, that&#039;s just an opinion I hold albeit I believe an educated one.<br /><br />Most of our anxiety about death is unconscious, especially if it&#039;s a subject you have not looked into before, by looking into some of it comes into consciousness. Though the vast majority will never see the light of day in most as it would and can send you insane. If we did not have mental blocks and shields against it you would be constantly scared out of your wits, a healthy person develops healthy ways to invest themselves in mental constructs in order to stay sane until the time we do die.<br /><br />What really made me notice it was reading Becker. Becker gives concrete examples of methods that we use to avoid being aware of our own mortality that you can really see throughout your own life and across society at large. His argument is that all humans have it and it is the motivator for a great deal of our behaviour. He expounds on the topic much better than I could from my limited studies. <br /><br />For me at least his theory made me aware of how death anxiety operates in my day to day life. I see it everywhere for these past few years and it&#039;s been trying at times: Books from the great authors (many of whom do understand this), on the television (think of how people like to seperate themselves from other animals and how they are rarely open about death, it offends out ears), in new age groups, religious groups, cults, sects, shamans and tribes (as Becker points out one particular tribal device was to wear butt plugs in order to deny the uglier features of our living organism), in art and the great structures and so on, if humans were involved you name it, it&#039;s there in my humble opinion.<br /><br />The Buddha, if we can say he existed, perhaps I should say the collection of words attributed to the Buddha recognized this too. Telling eager disciples looking for enlightenment that they be better off watching corpses burn that sticking around a monastery and meditating. As did many other famous Zen masters and other authors, they recognized we wanted permanence, the continuity of thought and ego. That the great pyramids erected by the blood and sweat of thousands of slaves to entomb one single organism was simply devoted to that project. That culture was one large sinking raft we cling to like so many poor souls thrown to sea by a capsized ship, designed at every level from family orientation to TV game shows and lotteries where the big win is right around the corner to keep that though of continuity alive.<br /><br />Of course they also saw their own attempts to seek and find happiness and ultimate enlightenment, the ultimate pleasure, like that eternal ever lasting please that you sink in at the moment of orgasm where time and space flys from the window and keep that going at all times, all things lined and in their proper place; that this feverish and constant seeking and hunger was fraught with and created by a basic desire for permanence.<br /><br />Since Becker and Otto Rank a group inspired by his works has sprung up and developed a theory they call Terror Management Theory. This group has run many studies highlighting that humans start to respond differently to questionnaires when confronted with their own mortality. In one study conducted by them it was shown that judges would give harsher sentences when confronted with it.<br /><br />If you are interested either read Becker, look into TMT, or if you are not a bookish or research oriented kind of guy there is also a documentary named &quot;Flight From Death&quot; that covers a reasonable amount on the topic.

Do you honestly think we humans are so important that without us it would not continue? All humans alive are not even a dust corn (actually many trillion times less than that in size) when looking at only our universe (which is also tiny when looking at the cosmos). So I wonder what makes you think that we are so important? To be frank, we don&#039;t matter and I think it&#039;s one of the biggest problems that so many humans think we do. Of course, if one believes in god or some other invented creature, one does think very differently. But as I said before, they are only believing.<br /><br />Nice talking to you anyways, I&#039;m gonna drop out of this now, having had this type of discussion plenty of times before and the conclusion is always gonna be the same, we&#039;ll have to agree to disagree.

				I know this may sound silly and corny but, it had recently occured to me, that the meaning of life IS to live.<br />You have probably heard it in every single movie out there, but if you actually think about it, what more of a simpler answer could you hope to have, than to live THAT moment in your life as if it were your last?<br />The trouble is, media has a good way of making us believe that we need to live this way, or, we need to do things that way.<br />Just live your life anyway you fucking please!.

				At risk of sounding like a hippy the meaning of life for me is &quot;love, truth and happiness&quot;. When we try and reverse the hedonic adaptation that we all inevitably develop we can start to experience wonder again for the simple things in life and learn to love living again and enjoy true happiness. The happier we all are the better decisions we all make the happier we all become. The only way to get on the right road is to truly learn to know yourself, good and bad, and strive to grow the good parts and work on the bad parts. <br /><br />I like the way the late Bill Hicks looked at life:<br /><br />&quot;Its just a ride, and we can change it any time we want, its only a choice, no effort, no work no job, no savings of money, a choice right now between fear and love.&nbsp; The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, and buy guns, close yourself off.&nbsp; The eyes of love instead see all of us as one.&nbsp; Here&#039;s what we can do to change the world right now to a better ride; Take all that money we spend on weapons and defence each year and instead spend it on feeding clothing and educating the poor of the world which it would many times over, not one human being excluded and we can explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.&quot;<br /><br />A must see stand up routine.<br /><br />LT

				Never found a reason other than blind ignorance to get up out of bed every morning.&nbsp; I never truly had a reason to be, that&#039;s until I found my soulmate and had an offspring. Nothing gets me out of bed more than getting to see those two people everyday. Sadly I believe I grew up too fast and fell into my path entirely too early.

				All I can keep saying is ignorance is what fuels our country. If people actually did what they wanted, nobody would be working the way society portrays it. More people would stick to their hobby if it made them money than going into a 9-5 everyday. It&#039;s fun to talk to people about jobs and careers, I can be anything I want, but I just to live easy and provide what I can for my family. If I didn&#039;t need money why would I work? Everything around you influences you to do the opposite of what your innerself truly wants. <br /><br />When people stop having the want and desire to seek knowledge is when I say they have lost the game of life and are now just a drone to society. If you realize that nothing should be a career and if you didn&#039;t have money to worry about your entire life you would be left trying to find that happiness. If everyone left to find happiness, who would make the roads, build the towers, make the resources we rely on daily? Noone, but the ones who have the desire to truly help people. While the rest are standing there asking what do I do? If people really wanted change, they would stop doing what they&#039;ve been doing for generations and wake up to the reality that our jobs are so measly and tiny. I find it easier to call jobs, steps, and challenges. The meaning of life is what you make it, you can manipulate your environment anytime you want, you can drastically change yourself in anyway possible, it&#039;s all in the belief and reason behind it.<br /><br />Life will never be explained better than, why worry about what happens next, when you still don&#039;t know what happened before....

				Perhaps some of the people on the Silk Road would disagree, but the incessant condemnation of religion that this thread has come to espouse is immensely problematic. Certainly, a great deal of strife has been yielded by religious conflicts over the years and people who dogmatically follow the ideology of science are certainly quick to recall this. Such &quot;intellectuals&quot; as Richard Dawkins would even go so far as to say that &quot;Jesus Christ must have been an Atheist, because he was, no doubt, an intelligent man&quot;. Of course this is simply a ridiculous thing to say. No one would be able to argue that Soren Kierkegaard, Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle, or whoever were unintelligent simply because they had beliefs that are, by today&#039;s standards, unscientific. Science is, of course, clearly demarcated from non-science, right? This question is the fundamental question which has plagued serious philosophers of science since its beginning. <br /><br />My view is that science is an ideological myth. Myth in this context shouldn&#039;t be understood as &quot;something which someone has made up&quot;, but rather as a Weltanschauung, or a lens of understanding, through which the individual understands everything to come to be. Religion is also an ideological myth. If we hold them to similar standards, we swiftly realize that the scientific rationality is a tradition in its own right, all method has a horizon of possibility, etc, etc, etc. That&#039;s not my point. My point is that, as far as establishing a meaningful relation to being in the world goes, scientific understandings of being the world and religious understandings of being in the world are interchangeable. Regardless of their specific content, both are intrinsically meaningful to the individual because they provide systems of values and methods of understanding the world around us. Ancient men saw a plethora of phenomena in the world and developed a notion of what it means to be in the world which was existentially meaningful, and practical for existence as a result. If one thinks they are in the position to make an absolute value judgment where one is illuminating of truth and the other is not, fair enough. Otherwise we needn&#039;t condemn the religious individual on the basis of being wrong, there is plenty more to condemn in the pious soul; whether he be religious or ein Krieger der Wissenchaft.

				Science is not a religion or even an ideology. Science is (to quote my dictionary) &quot;a branch of knowledge requiring systematic study and method, especially one of those dealing with substances, animal and vegetable life, and natural laws&quot;.<br /><br />Religion is a set of beliefs, requiring a level of faith. Science is a system for acquiring knowledge based on empirical studies, using the scientific process as the method of establishing facts. Although science has theoretical elements within it, these are arrived at using logic and reason, not blind faith.<br /><br />Also, to believe science and religion are diametrically opposed is just not true. Science does not devalue ones religious beliefs, the two don&#039;t have to be mutually exclusive. Many people are both strongly religious and scientifically curious about the world. Some respected scientists see intelligent design and the miraculous, through their scientific study of the world.<br /><br />I&#039;m not religious, and as long as religious people don&#039;t try to tell me what to believe, or what I can do (or who), then we&#039;ll get on fine. :)

				I would certainly never say they are diametrically opposed, which was precisely the point. I dont know if it is as simple as positing a Positivists perspective in arguing that all scientific knowledge is a. achieved by way of scientific, Enlightenment rationality. b. that science builds on itself in a linear fashion (that discoveries lead to further discoveries) c. that science is dependent upon reductionism (that everything be broken down to the simplest empirical element). <br />I prefer to distinguish between realism regarding theoretical entities (like electrons) and realism regarding theories. If the judgement of a theory&#039;s validity is based on its ontological proximity to truth, then we can hardly make any firm claims about the truth of a theory because theories shape our approach to empirical data. Our ontological enframing, which is historically embedded, places empirical data within a certain scope of understanding. Dante, for example, was not simple mistaken in believing the Earth was in the center of the universe and that the celestial bodies that rotated around him were embedded in crystalline spheres- obviously his theoretical understanding was influenced by Aristotle and Ptolemy. However he didn&#039;t merely believe the universe to be this way, when he looked up at the heavens he saw them appearing this way. Another example is Priestley and Lavoisier, faced with what we now understand as oxygen Priestley called it dephlogisted air, phlogiston being the &quot;fire molecule&quot; that people believed left a substance when it burned. For him it was the saturation of air with phlogiston which snuffed out a candle under a glass dome. You can see this is almost the exact opposite of how we understand oxidization to occur. Here Priestley&#039;s place within a theoretical paradigm enframed his approach to empirical evidence. <br />Realism about entities, which I advocate over realism about theories, is more concerned with judging the existence of theoretical entities (like electrons) on the basis of manipulative success. This is not to say electrons as we understand them exist, rather the concept acts as a placeholder where we cant attest to the truth regarding their existence- even though we presume an entity, which we describe as an electron, exist based on our ability to effect our reality. An example here would be the acetylation of morphine into diamorphine: we perceive and experience morphine; when one causes it to interact with acetic anhydride we can experience and perceive the bi-product, so we can claim that entities x, y, and z can be understood as real insofar as&nbsp; they can be manipulated consistently. Though this doesn&#039;t do anything to validate particular claims about the specific theoretical nature of their interaction, qualities of these entities, etc.<br /><br />I am not religious and I believe science has tremendous practical applications. However, I do believe that science as a lens of enframing&nbsp; is just that. Its not as though man is probing after Truth by way of the &quot;universal method of enlightened rationality&quot;, as if people were merely so fortunate as to be endowed with a methodology with allows for metaphysical certainty. <br /><br />But this is just all my opinion.<br />Everyone is certainly entitled to theirs.<br />

The future looked utterly worthless, I saw no value in relationships with those around me and the rest of the world seemed a cold, harsh, unforgiving place. I basically went through a couple of years of depression, the symptoms were classic: always wearing black or grey, feelings of worthlessness, boredom, feelings of hopelessness about the future, social interactions gave me no pleasure, I had no energy or &#039;get up and go&#039;.<br /><br />As soon as I stopped smoking weed my confidence started coming back, I began enjoying life more, having fun with my friends, going out and meeting new people. My whole life turned around. The most scary thing about that whole episode is you could&#039;ve told me &#039;till you were blue in the face that my feelings were symptoms of depression, brought about by my weed smoking. But I never would&#039;ve believed you. I thought all my problems came from inside, my own inadequacies, and that life was and always would be shit. I saw weed as one of the only positive things in my life! But when I did stop it was like a cloud lifting from my mind, I could think clearly and feel the whole range of emotions again. I didn&#039;t realize how much weed had changed me because it was such a slow process, bit by bit it had been draining my energy for life.<br /><br />I will say that only a percentage of people are effected by cannabis in this way. By no means is everyone the same, and I&#039;m not saying that this fate awaits every daily user of cannabis. It my not even be the cause of the way your feeling KazushiS58, but I do believe your are suffering from depression in some form or other. I do implore you to please go to your doctor (or whoever) and just talk to them about how your feeling, and get the opinion of someone else. By far the worst thing you can do is to reject any possibility you maybe suffering from depression (this is very common and can have disastrous consequences).<br /><br />Peace :)

Christmas is a bad time though, here in the UK it&#039;s dark and cold pretty much all the time and the amount of crap food you eat over christmas doesn&#039;t help. I suppose sorting my diet and getting some exercise are my main priorities for now.<br /><br />Cheers guys.
