				I&#039;ve decided shit-liberals are all somewhat like hack boxing analyst Max Kellerman. Kellerman is this goofy Jew-boy who never played sports, never wrote anything, never did anything of note but he just gets gigs as a color commentator for no reason. So Kellerman is always pretending to be some &#039;&#039;tough&#039;&#039; guy from the streets or some kind of guru, to compensate for the fact that he&#039;s just a rich-kid Jewish nerd of mediocre intelligence <br /><br />Shit-liberals are just goofy creeps whose parents sent them to college for no reason. They aren&#039;t very smart and they are not attractive or charasmatic. They have no religion or culture or anything. So they just pretend to be &#039;&#039;outraged&#039;&#039; (by &quot;racism&quot;, &quot;sexism&quot;, &quot;homophobia&quot;, etc) in order to compensate for a lack of personality or any interesting trait.

				hi Joywind,<br /><br />You&#039;ve used this specific phrase &#039;shit-liberals&#039; and not simply &#039;liberals&#039;.<br />So what proportion of liberals are &#039;shit-liberals&#039; ? ... approximately.<br />

				I&#039;m pretty sure the shit liberals have formed a coalition with the shit Torys in my country. It makes a change from shit labour.<br /><br />I&#039;VE decided that shite libertarians are the kind who don&#039;t like things to be too complicated, so they have adopted the extreme end of one ideological axis. That way if anyone ever asks them a question about a political or economic problem, they don&#039;t need to think. They can just say &quot;well I think we should let the free market decide.&quot;

				I have no problem with liberals or &quot;lefties&quot;. I used to be a liberal. The liberals I have known are very much like libertarians in the sense that they just want to be left the fuck alone, like the people who formed the communes, some of which are still around today. I guess the proper term for those people are anarcho-primitivists. I even respect the anarcho-communists and anarcho-socialists, not to be confused with asshole Marxists. Some of the best discussion/debates I have ever been in were with knowledgeable ancomms/ansocs, unlike those bratty little Marxists who are angry that someone, somewhere has more &quot;stuff&quot; than they do. <br /><br />The problem I have is what many of these old liberals have become....PROGRESSIVES. They have actually morphed into the same type of&nbsp; Autoritarian douchebags that they protested against in the 60s. They are statists (in the very worst sense of the word), planners, social engineers who think that they know what is best for everybody else, and that no one could ever possibly take care of themselves without the their &quot;wisdom&quot; or knowledge, so it must be forced onto people with the threat of and use of deadly violence. The are self-important, arrogant. intellectually constipated assholes that want to control everything in &quot;society&quot; from the type of food people eat, to how much someone can sell a loaf of bread for. Well, what would you expect from an &quot;ideology&quot; that has roots in: Eugenics, Imperialism, central banking, and world war. <br /><br />So, I suppose when the the OP says &quot;shit liberal&quot; what he really means is &quot;progressive&quot;.<br /><br /><br />(Hmmm, I haven&#039;t ranted like that in a while.&nbsp; :D)
