				Ever since I was a little kid I&#039;ve had what some people may call &quot;a strong sense of justice&quot; and I believe in absolute morals (not relative ones). This is not a bad thing, but because I have such strong believes I have problems listening to other people express themselves when they say things I find stupid/oppressive and so on. As a result I can&#039;t watch the news on TV and I can&#039;t read newspapers. Politics are the worse. When there are political debates on TV I need to leave the room because I get so frustrated and angry watching the debate. I don&#039;t have the gift of formulating myself quickly and witty and winning the audience (who usually prefer wit over reasoning), so I also avoid any political discussions with people around me. The only exceptions are my family and a few chosen friends who &quot;think much like I do.&quot; As you realize I&#039;m not doing any good avoiding politics and I won&#039;t ever make my voice heard this way. I&#039;m glad there are others out there who talk better than I do and can take on this role in society, but sometimes I wish I could just watch TV and partake in a discussion with acquaintances, instead of making a bathroom visit so I don&#039;t have to hear them. Does anyone else have this problem? Any ideas how I can approach it?

				I&#039;ve got a very similar problem and it has been the main motivational factor in really learning a lot about living sustainably, off the grid, producing all your own food and power.<br />I feel inherent guilt living in the culture I live in, being white and middle class especially. Our tax dollars go to raping and pillaging peoples and lands around the globe, not to mention those dollars aren&#039;t even a legitimate currency issues by an illegitimate power structure, assuming their authority over free peoples.

				Yeah, I hate it when your getting friendly with someone and then they assume you share all their beliefs and then they start spouting off like anyone who doesn&#039;t agree with them is an idiot. <br />I think people like that are fearful of not being part of the herd. Every now and then I meet someone who can calmly discuss political opinions without making things awkward.

I hate it when people look you right in the eye and say some bullshit statement that you&#039;re obviously suppose to agree with. Like they&#039;re desperately looking to you for some kind of social validation. Fuck man, we&#039;re all just trying to make it through life. You may not be what society expects of you, but Jezzus - don&#039;t belittle yourself by seeking desperate acceptance of people you just met.
