				There are 4 more years for someone to come out of nowhere and contend. The rest of your analysis made sense to me though. With the exception of Rockefellers and other bourgeoiss determining who they want to win.

				Yeah i could see that illuminati symbol of an old bag as next president. I could also see Obama somehow claim martial law in the next 4 years and never leave office, but more than likely ill be wrong. Will be interesting to see how it plays out. One things for certain it will not be good for Americans or human decency across this planet in general.

				I think Christopher Hitchens once referred to Hillary Clinton as &quot;looking like a dog being washed&quot;. I would have to agree. The problem with the Clinton&#039;s is they are 100% out for themselves both first and second. That leaves little time to think about what is really good for the Country. I will be extremely disappointed if we cannot come up with some decent candidates for 2016.

				@Digit - you stole my thunder. <br /><br />I&#039;m convinced Obama will end presidential term limits, and not only be reelcted, but be president for life. <br /><br />The amount of shit this adminstration has gotten away with. The whole OBL thing with no proof, no pictures, just their word. <br /><br />The tons of Solyndra like scams where he paid back contributors, when all these &quot;Green Energy&quot;scam companies were just front corporations. Whose going to pay back that money?<br /><br />Then the Chinook Helicopter crash killing all the Navy Seals, the same ones involved in the alleged Bin Laden capture,&nbsp; was swept under the rug by the ever compliant media. Those guys were set up. <br /><br />We have a tyrant in the white house, being controlled by dark forces who want nothing more than to rape and pillage our country. <br /><br />I really feel it&#039;s already too late. We&#039;re slowly becoming a Socialist country. Notice how good that&#039;s worked out for our European friends. <br /><br />Yes Hillary got away with a lot, as the worst Secy of State in US history. Yet she was praised as the best!<br /><br />She leaves her post with the Middle East on fire! More so than ever! - Every Muslim uprising was given our full support, removing leaders that (however brutal) were cooperating with us!<br /><br />Instead the US, under this regime, has assisted The Muslim Brotherhood, in taking over each of these countries where the phony uprisings took place. <br /><br />Egypt is a prime example of how fucked up the Hillary Obama current ruling class are.&nbsp; Yet no one bats an eye. The reporters in the US are now nothing more than stenographers, awaiting the talking points from the Obama regime. <br /><br />That&#039;s why I&#039;m on here. I want to remain &quot;comfortably numb&quot; rather than see the great nation I grew up in, reduced to that of Cuba under Castro. <br /><br />

				Clinton is not running in 2016 and even if she was, she would not get the nomination.&nbsp; She is too old, and this superficial, mindless nation demands someone more telegenic.<br /><br />Not that its going to matter anyway, every candidate with any chance to win has already been preselected and screened so that no one with any original ideas stands a chance (i.e. Ron Paul who&#039;s party broke its own rules, and in some cases [Iowa, Maine] simply lied about the vote tally).&nbsp;

				I personally don&#039;t think that Obama will end presidential term limits bec there is no need for it as every 4 years anyone who gets nominated to run for president is preselected and a puppet who will do as told and ignore the people. This way they retain the illusion of freedom alive and continue to do whatever they want and get away with it.&nbsp; To get rid of presidential term limits would mess with this illusion of freedom making this illusion that keeps people sleep harder to keep alive and they want people to think they are free but obey no matter what. <br /><br />Anyways I enjoyed reading everyone&#039;s input and great discussion.
