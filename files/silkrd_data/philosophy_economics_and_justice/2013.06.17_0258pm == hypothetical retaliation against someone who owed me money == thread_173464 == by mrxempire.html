				My problem has already been resolved in a friendly manner, but I was curious to know if my retaliation plan would have worked. About 6 months ago, I acquired some mushies for a co-worker of mine, that I planned on selling to him. Unfortunately, he hit a financial speed bump, and was unable to pay me for awhile. No problem, I said. Worst case scenario, I&#039;ll just find someone else to sell to. I held on to these shrooms for a couple months, until my co-worker told me he was able to buy them from me. So, i brought the shrooms to work with me the next time we were both scheduled together. Unfortunately he was unable to make it to the atm for some reason, so he asked if he could hold on to the shrooms for now, and just simply pay me the next day. I was a little annoyed, but I allowed it. However, the next day, he had another excuse as to why he couldn&#039;t get me the money, and again the next day, and the day after that. I started to get a little worried, and suspected that he was going to attempt to take the shrooms without paying for them. I began thinking about what I should do if he really tried to pull this on me.&nbsp; It wasn&#039;t really about the money, just the fact that he thought he could just take the mushrooms from me without paying. Luckily for me, he had just been really busy during those days and paid me a few days later, so we no longer have an issue. :P However, I am still curious to see if my plan would have worked if I was forced to take action. If he had not paid me, or returned the shrooms to me by the next time we worked together, I would have politely and privately told him that he was responsible for the shrooms after I gave them to him, and still had to pay me regardless of his excuse. I would have given him a month to pay me back, and maybe even take 10 or 20 dollars off the price just to be understanding, but at the same time, remind him that stealing from me would end up costing him more than what those mushrooms were worth. If a month went by, and no attempt to pay me back was made, then one day I would discreetly follow him home from work in a friends car, to find out where he lived. A few days later, I would borrow a heavy duty pocket knife from another friend, the type with those little button things on the end meant for smashing car windows. And a few nights later I would sneak back to his residence, and break his car windows using the pocket knife, maybe slash the tires too if I was able to. It would cost him significantly more money to fix his car than it would to have just paid me for the shrooms. The next time I saw him at work, I would say something like &quot;hey man, I had a change of heart about that money you owe me, don&#039;t worry about it&quot; and that would be that. Obviously he would probably have figured I was responsible for the damages, but would there be anything he could do about it? He couldn&#039;t go to the police, because our argument was about magic mushrooms. I have texts between me and him about buying the mushrooms, but I would have made all &quot;threats&quot; in person. So, by showing the police the texts, either they wouldn&#039;t do anything, or we would both get in trouble. I would make extra sure that I had a clean house in case the police searched it for evidence. My co-worker is in his early 30&#039;s with a wife and kids, so I feel that he wouldn&#039;t go to the police about it, but even if he did, is there any way I could get in trouble? I&#039;d like to stress again that this is a HYPOTHETICAL plan, since he already paid me back, but it would be good to get some legal feedback on this retaliation plan in case I ever need to use this on another person. I&#039;m not a thug, but I simply won&#039;t allow anybody to take advantage of my kindness like I thought my co-worker had done

				Legally? Not unless he caught you fucking up his car.&nbsp; Regardless of whether he stole the mushrooms, if you cause him significantly more financial damage and he KNOWS it was you because you make it clear it was you, I&#039;d assume he&#039;d want to cause you similar or worse damage.&nbsp; So you may cause him more financial damage, but he might just retaliate back costing you even more money. Just because someone has a wife and kids doesn&#039;t mean they won&#039;t pay someone else to break your shit either. This is why I will not ever front anyone but extremely close friends and family.
