				The bank can open any safety box, for any reason, without a warrant. The safety deposit box is the bank&#039;s property.

Only illusions as such. Anything you want secure, is only as secure as your ability to know no one else can access it.

In my country a search warrant is enough to look anywhere. Not always a bad thing though cause when they have to find the plutonium before the next attack it&#039;s not bogged down by red tape. Until drugs are legal the key for us is to keep a low profile and play safe - don&#039;t ever give anyone a reason to conduct a search. Also, participate in politics to keep your government in check. Don&#039;t let them turn their backs on the reason why we have search and seizure allowances and have them waste it on busting college kids for weed.&nbsp;
