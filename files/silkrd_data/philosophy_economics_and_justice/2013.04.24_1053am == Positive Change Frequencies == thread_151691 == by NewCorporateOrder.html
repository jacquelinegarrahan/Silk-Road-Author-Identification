				This is a manifesto (in progress) on how our generation can seize total democracy, by forcing a renaissance of the corporate age using freedom of information. A single unified anarchical online community could achieve this on a website platform through which you could purchase any products needed for your life in a databse of corporate produce and products.<br /><br />******<br /><br />It&#039;s no secret nowadays that corporations and businesses are the only truly valid bidders on the majority of our legal statutes and mainstream political candidates (if they wish to be adequately funded). And it is no secret that our model of society is currently retarded. Yet our generation, in as much as it is enlightened by the innovations of science, can use optimism as our best weapon for change, as the human race is now psychically linked together, not telepathically, but through the internet. Corporate entities are made up entirely by ideas from the human imagination, and essentially this means that with the introduction of a global satellite communication system, that in our century the most prevalent and influential corporations are grown purely from the internet (Facebook, Google, Yahoo etc.). So let&#039;s tap into the source, and make THE CORPORATION which rules all other corporations exist on the internet. And let&#039;s make it an anarchist regime. We&#039;ll make any person who joins and makes purchases through the website an instant free member of the corporation. It&#039;ll be powerful because of the number of people who join it and understand what it&#039;s used for. Their membership card for the most powerful corporation in the world will be sent to their address after they make three &#039;proper perspective purchases&#039;. With information disseminated and public forums of debate and &#039;intelligent advertisement expression&#039;, our corporation will also be the optimum market for members of the corporation to make all of their purchases from. But here is the mind-bending concept, our purchases aren&#039;t actually equivalent to us buying into a brand, our purchases are the equivalent of us &#039;buying out&#039; the company behind the brand. I will go more into these concepts later. But for now I just want to state my vision.<br /><br />Our entire world is hard to control because of all the chaos, but even in the chaos, major global events run through a system. A lot of people today seriously believe our system is inherently evil. I think every human is half evil. I think it&#039;s just a faulty system out of which we can create and EVEN BETTER system! Without any need to take down our current system, we just need to &#039;reverse the status quo&#039; so to speak. <br /><br />If our world were to become so corrupt and fearful that we were to erupt in violent rebellion, that would be barbarism. Nothing else could pave the way more acceptably for totalitarianism. I believe if the struggle between the greed and disdain of the corporate giants and the anger and protest of the civilians were a chess match, we&#039;d be only a few moves away from putting the corporations in check-mate. If we can make our moves with finesse and intelligence, then we can give corporations an ultimatum... either they yield to our principles or else their business model will be outdated by the one I am proposing to you all that we work towards.<br /><br />Actually, to call this a business model would be inaccurate. My idea is to create an entirely new customer model, using the huge amount of freedom that the internet gives to the consumer, so that using our collective &#039;votes&#039; as &#039;purchases&#039;, we could actually use an online hub to vote in the corporations that reconstruct society in the way that we wish with the influence of their huge wealth. Think of this as evolution, nature rewards a productive symbiotic relationship. The companies benefit from the hivemind of consumers, because they need us to exist, not the other way around.<br /><br />Principled capitalism. Think of the power capitalism has, but it has no channel, no goal besides human greed. But, what if we were able to introduce a filter? The internet. <br /><br />Advertisers thrive on insecurities. So the status quo is that you should worry about how you look to others because you don&#039;t have the ability to alter the system. We need to reverse the status quo. Human beings are intelligent creatures, so to have human beings psychologically focused on &quot;identity&quot; insecurities, instead of being psychologically focused on the ecological insecurities of our current system, is our race&#039;s greatest waste of resources. I don&#039;t think we need to stop everyone from having insecurities, we just need advertisements that are more psychologically relevant to the goals of our ENTIRE RACE, survival!! - corporations with advertisements that focus on our ecological insecurities instead of our identity-insecurities. <br /><br />Visual media is no longer in the total control of the rich - it&#039;s becoming quite the opposite, and the disconnected people from society are actually the originators of the most wide-spread images on the internet - memes. The internet has turned visual media into a diplomatic forum for evaluating society, it is the first evolutionary stage of us waging psychological warfare back against the conventions and hidden rules of society that force us to worry about our identities constantly. <br /><br />Ultimately, regardless of how much we hate this inevitable fact, it is we who put the corporate powers into power. If the status quo in everyone&#039;s heads can flip upside down, then what could we achieve? Can a website-corporation flip this status quo? With our massive numbers the common internet could put the corporations out of power too, simply by allying themselves with a corporation more powerful than any other which exists on the internet. It is instantly accessible, and can even buy into other corporations to offer effective lobbying for legal statutes to change the infrastructure of our world to favour you and your future generations. That&#039;s how democracy works, right? But politicians no longer serve us, so we&#039;d have to reform the system in order to change the infrastructure, the agriculture, and &quot;the art&quot; (more on the art in future rewriteups) of our culture. Reforming the system is insanely difficult, to resist the system you must subvert it. But there are two ways to subvert something, either you run and hide in the shadows and live free of its laws, or you make yourself the king of it and rule the thing you now have power over which you can subvert. So I&#039;m suggesting the internet culture could make itself a corporate entity with influence over every single other corporation. Our motto would be &quot;the consumer owns the market, not the monopolies.&quot; Because, the corporation is anarchically ruled by consumers, whose purchases are votes for companies that openly advertise what they&#039;re going to lobby and their ecological methods of improving the human race. If the corporation decided to buy out Company A (ie. a billion of its members purchase their goods through it all from Company A because of its stellar positive integration into the community) then Company A has won more profit than anybody else by appeasing to the anarchical corporation, the biggest online corporation on earth. What is ethical and what is not will of course as always be totally the decision of pure democracy, as with greater numbers of consensus you can achieve greater things.<br /><br />My hunch is that everyone in the world is trying to reevaluate their approach to changing the world (and themselves) right now, an ideological shift in society is occuring and to no suprise since we are still in the early stages of a completely revolutionary system of communication. When nature becomes more advanced in one aspect, every other aspect must adapt, an evolutionary hurdle is being proposed to corporations right now. Companies that don&#039;t make their presence felt online will be left behind. This is because our lifestyles are shifting into online mode. Right now facebook is worth billions because of the exposure it offers for companies to advertise, ceo&#039;s understand that online acceptance is one of the most valuable commodities of this upcoming century. It will be THE most valuable commodity. And our online coproration for consumers will control that commodity, and thus control other company&#039;s effects on political decisions. This is putting an anarchy on top of the pyramid. The best place to have our ideals forcefully heard is on the INTERNET, rather than on wallstreet, because we can organise our own consuming on the internet. If corporations can&#039;t adapt to our needs and wants for an improved ECOLOGY of the world that is actually on par with our current scientific understanding of ecologies, why not create a website which gives us the power to bring the more FAIR MINDED corporations into mammoth sized proportions? Instead of having thousands of dole bludgers too apathetic about the way our society is running (and for good reason) living with only half a connection to the world around them, why not form new corporations that those apathetic yet highly gifted minds can actually be enthusiastic about and dedicate their lives to knowing that they are outphasing a retarded way of living? Corporations that are up to speed with the consciousness of the people.<br /><br />There is more than one kind of symbiosis in nature. (thanks wikipedia)<br /><br />PARASITICAL SYMBIOSIS<br />Only one organism benefits and the other is harmed - this is the current global central bank corporation. Nature rewards the parasite, as we can see with how fat the banksters have gotten from the blood of their victims. Parasitical symbiosis is also formed between the corporations and third world.<br /><br />COMMENSALISM<br />One organism benefits and the other organism isn&#039;t significantly harmed or helped. This is the symbiosis existing between first world people and their product-based corporations.<br />&nbsp;<br />AMENSALISM<br />One organism beings detrimentally harmed, while the other remains unaffected. This is what exists right now between out lifestyles, and those of the third world (ie. the one&#039;s working in sweat shops to allow us to have this conversation right now.)<br /><br />BUT, we can end amensalism, if we change out relationship with corporations to MUTUALISM. <br />&quot;During mutualistic symbioses, the host cell lacks some of the nutrients, which are provided by the endosymbiont. As a result, the host favors endosymbiont&#039;s growth processes within itself by producing some specialized cells.&quot;<br /><br />Our society lacks &quot;nutrients&quot;, so we just need a way to be able to act as the &quot;hosts&quot; (which is what we are, since we can exist individually, whereas coporations can only exist symbiotically by their essence), and thus favour the growth of endosymbiont&#039;s whom we will to improve our world. But how can we act as hosts? What platform could we achieve this through? This would have been an impossible question 30 years ago. But right now we have the platform that can make it work, we are speaking through it right now sharing ideas that would have been impossible to share before. Literally the only thing we need, is collective belief in a website that can run the corporate world. Once that&#039;s established, corporations that adapt to the website are suddenly given a huge levy over its competitors - but to get such online attention they must play by our rules. That&#039;s the trick. Corporations already pay millions of dollars for online exposure, they know its going to be an invaluable commodity. But WE are the rulers of the internet, not them, our generation is smarter, hipper, and controls the greatest gift of all advertising which is &quot;coolness&quot;. When the cypherpunk becomes a mainstream fad, as it seems to be growing into right now, our global community will be in just the right mindset to make an idea like this work. Especially looking at the recent wallstreet protests. Sometimes the best way to solve an imaginary problem is just to invent an imaginary solution that could work is people used it en masse!

For instance, whatever you are browsing the internet on right now is most likely made in some sweat-shop or other in a developing nation where the workers are paid $0.50/day - are you going to give up the internet until there&#039;s an ethical CPU manufacturer?<br /><br />- You will never convince the majority of &#039;straights&#039; (totally necessary) sounding like a crazed-corporate-acid-head-hippy<br /><br />Quite frankly, I don&#039;t really understand half of what you&#039;re saying or what you actually think you might achieve, but tell me if I&#039;m wrong in saying this; your idea is to basically rank businesses and corporations on their &#039;ethical&#039; characteristics?

We need more of that! But I would suggest you supplement that by reading some economics and monetary theory, as well as looking into different economic models. Maybe also hang around a few &#039;straight&#039; forums and talk to the kinds of people you would need to convince of your ideas, refine them a bit, get to the core of what you&#039;d want to achieve and start to recruit others who feel the same way.<br /><br />Good luck!&nbsp; ;D

				&nbsp;;D Thanks!<br />This is just the beginning. It&#039;s what I would call a brain dump. <br /><br />My idea is to give companies motivation to change society in the way we want it changed, by proposing a new consumer-ruled corporation that anyone can join and contribute towards, a corporation that consists entirely of consumers that buy their products based on the changes they want done in society. It&#039;s not like a certain product is only manufacturable by one single corporate entity, that&#039;s buying into the idea of capitalistic dictatorship. Our open-source corporation will have a unique power no other corporation has, the ability to give extremely rapid accelerated growth to the corporations it democratic elects. Our purchases are our votes, and we only purchase from companies whose advertisements target ecological insecurities instead of psychological insecurities. If a large enough percentage of our online userbase is in consensus about what product/business is lobbying the world for the best reforms and constructions, it is like our conceptual corporation is buying into theirs. And if we have a large enough userbase, ie. if this can become a fad that the whole middle classed and welfare demographics join, then our company can have more resources than any other. <br /><br />It is a free company to join, and perhaps we could even send a membership card in the mail to each new user after they have made their first informed purchase?<br /><br />Think of it this way, we are reversing the pyramid of power.<br /><br />********<br /><br />To me fiat currencies are a major issue, because of the need of a bank as a middle-way. But that is always the problem, the middle-man. And the politician is nothing more than the middle-man between the corporation and the government. So, by logic, if we can tap into the power that drives corporations, then there is no need for us to even bother with the politician or the government because we&#039;d already be in control. And tapping into the power that drives corporations is merely tapping into ourselves, and organizing a community online where advertisements focus on the true identity of the one&#039;s advertising, a website through which we can buy all of our products necessary for life - products reaching a certain popularity are lobbied to local retailers, who will respond to the organised demand of the community for products that are based on the principle of improving corporations rather than improving consumers, who are already intelligent enough on their own to self-evaluate.

				Nice - a brain dump! Don&#039;t forget to save it somewhere you wont lose it - you might not be able to find it here again in 12 months time!<br /><br />And the problem with current currencies is not middle men, it&#039;s interest. It&#039;s the fact that all money represents debt to a central bank, but since the total amount of currency in existence is always less than the debt (since the debt is all the currency + the interest payments on that debt) the system only works so long as we keep &#039;growing&#039; the economy and borrowing more money, to buy things, so that previous borrowers can pay down their debts. Anyone who doesn&#039;t owe any money and has a &#039;profit&#039; is basically requiring others somewhere in the world to borrow more money to pay for whatever they&#039;re producing. This is absolute lunacy! We need currencies based on wealth, not debt. You might find these podcasts interesting, I know I did:<br /><br />KR12 - Stop! And think for a moment.... http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/26262<br />KR20 - Stop!

				Oh, I agree with what you&#039;re saying, I just disagree that any such &#039;evolutionary&#039; pressure to develop to the situation we have now has anything to do with having enough information on how ethical the companies and products we use are. The real pressure is an economic model that ensure constant scarcity of resources while at the same time driving constant growth. Knowing that Apple or Intel or whoever is basically using Chinese people as slaves doesn&#039;t matter, since there is such a scarcity of access to resources (money) that even if there were an ethical alternative it would not be affordable and therefore is not feasible as a business and gets auto-darwinated as &#039;un-fit&#039;. Simply giving ethical rankings for companies wouldn&#039;t apply the right evolutionary pressure to actually change things.<br /><br />I did have an idea of something that might; debt-tracking without restriction of access, limit, or interest. So what happens is all economic transactions happen digitally (probably encrypted in a similar way to BTC) using a unit that, for now, I will call &#039;Kudos&#039; (I got that idea from Iain Banks) and all things are worth a certain amount of Kudos calculated using a simple algorithm; time/effort required x skill multiplier x equipment multiplier x &#039;wealth&#039; multiplier + same calc for all the materials required (I mean &#039;wealth&#039; in the R Buckminter Fuller uses it). That way it doesn&#039;t matter if you make it here, or there, it&#039;ll always be worth the same; it is in fact an actual measure of &#039;worth&#039;. Not sure how you would add a &#039;governor&#039; to prevent insane amounts of environmental destruction (maybe &#039;wealth&#039; multipliers &lt;1 or &lt;0), but I&#039;m working on it... But what&#039;s to stop everyone just building up huge negetive-Kudos? Reputation - if all you ever do is build up negetive-Kudos you will very quickly get seen as a parasite, but it wouldn&#039;t necessarily happen since +Kudos would be easy to obtain - you wouldn&#039;t need a job or anything, you&#039;d just do stuff for people that was worth a bit of Kudos back. How would you get essential stuff done? Well, suddenly all sorts of jobs that are very desirable now because they supply alot of money would be less desirable since they do not create much &#039;worth&#039; and therefore would have quite low Kudos scores, whereas other things that are not so desirable would have high Kudos scores (think actor vs hospital cleaner). I think the best way to get it to work would be to get it adopted in developing nations that have the ability to be self-sustaining first... South America or Africa.....<br /><br />Another great idea would be to find a way to adapt Bernard Lietear&#039;s Commercial Credit Circuit (C3) to use &#039;wealth&#039; based currencies instead of debt based ones:<br /><br />http://www.lietaer.com/category/proposals/

				It&#039;s not freedom of information about ethics that will cause evolutionary pressure on corporations, that information already exists. It&#039;s the changing of the mindset of the consumer that will cause evolutionary pressure. Just convince the buyer that a hivemind of buyers can control the market, and clearly lay out a website platform that could achieve this, if enough people used it. As a hivemind we are strong. There would probably need to be a few starter-up corporations on the website that are more ethically dedicated to the community rather than the private profiteers who take too large a sum of society&#039;s wealth. Then the hivemind can sponsor these into power simply by having a very convenient platform to purchase their goods on. Perhaps we could create a renaissance of the industrial age, and simply create demand for a new kind of corporation for the future? For a principled capitalism.<br /><br />I wanna create a website that allows extreme convenience in buying the products you want, and which destroys the catharsis that ads attempt to put the consumer under - by replacing it with the ancient greek idea of the audience taking a creating role in the advertisement the way the audience participates in the play in the theatre of Dionysus. <br /><br />I like what you&#039;re saying because it reduces the rating of &#039;worth&#039; to a mathematical value that is super simple to digest. It&#039;ll take me some time to digest your idea. I&#039;d really like to revisit maths some time in the future. I&#039;d like to integrate something like that into my fantasy-site.
