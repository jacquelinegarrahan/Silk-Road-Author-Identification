				When I was young and (more) ignorant, I thought I could solve some of my problems with drugs. I was wrong.<br />There were times when I was unknowingly using drugs to self-medicate. Those experiments only caused problems.<br />I have a problem with the phrase &quot;self-medicate&quot; being used as a synonym for &quot;getting high&quot;. Sometimes I was emotionally low and drugs would help get me out of my rut (self-medication), but there were also times when I was content but I simply wanted to feel even better (get high).<br /><br />Nowadays my philosophy is to improve my long-term/chronic problems without drugs, by using education, exercise, counciling, meditation, etc. I also have no problem with using drugs to feel better than content, but I no longer justify it by saying I &quot;need&quot; to get high, nor do I feel guilty about it.<br />I plan to switch a majority of my drug use to entheogens.<br /><br />This site is so MUCH more than druggies trying to get a fix and I absolutely love that.<br /><br />Post anything that you feel is relevant. :)

				Sweet topic! I like!<br /><br />&nbsp;My personal philosophy is to take what I need as I need it, and to NEVER apologize to those who would have you feel guilty about being &quot;on drugs&quot;.&nbsp; This is MY ride.&nbsp; I only get ONE.&nbsp; I wont tell you how to spend your short time here, and you give me the same respect.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been kicked out of several treatment programs because I refuse to apologize for using drugs.&nbsp; Who the fuck should&nbsp; be apologizing to?&nbsp; My wife and I are both physically dependent on opiates.&nbsp; For now, we stay well by taking methadone daily at the local clinic.&nbsp; This is less than ideal as it is very restrictive. We hope to some day develop the knowledge and connections to discretely produce a better suited maintenance drug ourselves and take our &quot;recovery&quot;-for lack of a better word- into our own hands so that we&#039;re no longer subject to the ridiculous rules, regs and restrictions of a methadone clinic.&nbsp; I am working towards a phlebotomy certification while at the same time studying organic chemistry and pharmacology.&nbsp; My wife is studying to be an MD.&nbsp; We are very motivated, good-natured, and compassionate &quot;dope fiends&quot;.&nbsp; We&#039;ve told our family and friends who we are and what we are about.&nbsp; Of the ones who are mature enough to be okay with that, we have wonderful relationships with them; the rest are dead to us, frankly.<br /><br />It took a LOT of blood, sweat, vomit and tears to get to where I am today.&nbsp; I have a beautiful wife who has lived the typical junky-gutter existence I have and she loves and cherishes me as I do her: above all else.&nbsp; I have an outlook on life and personal philosophy that have been HARD-fucking-won.&nbsp; I have relationships with people who I don&#039;t have to hide from.&nbsp; They know who I am, what I&#039;m about, and they all trust me.&nbsp; 3 years ago I had NOTHING.&nbsp; Not much has changed since then as far as what drugs I do.&nbsp; All that HAS really changed is the fact that I&#039;m no longer willing to feel shame over the fact that my body has adapted to need opiates every day.&nbsp; <br /><br />Looking forward, my wife and I dream of the day when we can wake up to a world that has decided not to play the &quot;shame game&quot; anymore and I hope that as things progress, more people come forward to say: &quot;I&#039;m a productive member of society, and what I do in my own home is nobody&#039;s business so long as it&#039;s peaceful&quot; <br /><br />So, just to comment on your OP, you say that you&#039;d like to &quot;improve...long-term/chronic problems without drugs&quot;.&nbsp; I would say that so long as you are improving in life, who cares if it is &quot;with drugs&quot;?!&nbsp; I am cognizant of the fact that sometimes what starts as a crutch can become a hindrance,&nbsp; but be very careful about falling into the &quot;blame the drugs&quot; crowd that you&#039;re likely to find in any &quot;rehabilitation&quot; program.&nbsp; The truth is, ANYTHING in this world that can be used to your advantage can become a disadvantage.&nbsp; As my fav comedian Joe Rogan once said: &quot;I could jam a fork into my eye, do we need to outlaw forks too?! Let&#039;s Nerf the WORLD!&quot; The small group of compounds we refer to as &quot;drugs&quot; are no exception, but they aren&#039;t particularly special either.<br /><br />You say there is no guilt attached to your using drugs but the use of terms like &quot;self medicate&quot; seem to suggest otherwise.&nbsp; I&#039;d advise to let that shit go as soon as possible.&nbsp; People, animals, hell even plants &quot;self-medicate&quot;, there&#039;s nothing real behind that phrase other than the false weight put there by abstinence-based fuckery.&nbsp; &quot;Self-medicting&quot; doesn&#039;t really mean anything.&nbsp; The implication is that you shouldn&#039;t be trusted to know when you yourself are uncomfortable or what constitutes appropriate alleviation of said discomfort.&nbsp; <br /><br />Your distinction between common &quot;drugs&quot; and &quot;entheogens&quot; is telling as well.&nbsp; &quot;Entheogen&quot; is kind of a silly term for what most of us know as &quot;psychedelics&quot;.&nbsp; Taking a class of compounds and then classifying them as being &quot;of the spirit/soul&quot; kind of puts unreasonable limitations and expectations on them.&nbsp; While, yes, you can do a lot of &quot;soul searching&quot; with these compounds (Ram Dass comes to mind), you can also use them to conjure up &quot;demons&quot;.&nbsp; Look at the Aztecs for example: they were mushroom eating motherfuckers for sure but if mushrooms were truly &quot;entheogens&quot;&nbsp; you wouldn&#039;t have had Aztec priests sacrificing innocent lives at a stone altar by ripping their still-beating heart from the chest with a jagged obsidian blade at the urgings of demons that the priests and kings spoke with while under the influence of psylocibin.&nbsp; No sir, in the hands of the Aztecs, mushrooms could hardly be called &quot;entheogens.&nbsp; <br /><br />So, I would just caution you to examine what you really want out of this life and go after it with every tool at your disposal....&amp; fuck anyone who would have you feel guilty about it.

				My personal philosophy is to order as much stuff that I have no clue about on the interwebz.. usually the longer the name of the drug the better. I then put it all into a top hat. Close my eyes.. and take my pick. The fun part about this philosophy is to try and guess the drug you took just from the effects.<br /><br />

				Myself I had alot of friend whle I was younger and we was experimenting with all kinds of drugs at the beginning, I evolved to skip all drugs exept cannabis..<br /><br />My other friend did not evolve and they continued to use all kinds of drugs but now they have alls topped using drugs, and now they speak out against drugs and for the war on drugs since they got into a rehab and there they got manipulated by the same old propaganda that wants people to hate on drugs but love the war on drugusers.<br /><br />I have been trying to talk to most of them about serious stuff like the war in our contry but they still &quot;know&quot; its a great and usefull war that did not protect them from getting drugs, but they are blind to the facts.<br /><br />To me a bit of weed makes learning interesting things online, food, movies and a videogame around 42% more fun.<br /><br />I wanna save my lungs now tho so Imma eat some weed just to prove to myself that Im not addicted to the smoke of weeds, I know I aint tho since its no problem going a couple of weeks without weed but it shure as hell on Earht woould be more fun to live your life if I had eaten some cannabis.. But I dont know maybe its to much to be walkin around eating weed. I remember I ate a raw flower whe I was a grower in the past and I dont even remeber what happened but I know I was really lost like almost as lost as I used to be after a night of Xtc-use, forgetting what we talked about in the middle of the conversation and stuff hahahaa<br /><br />I cant really agree with my old friends since I say either youre against drugs and for the war, or youre against the war that makes the drugs avalible fo kids all over the world.. But you cant be talkin against drugs while ignoring to talk about the war since then your supporting the war.<br /><br />i dont know who made the right choice in the end, my friend that quit all kinds of drugs just to be able to walk around telling others how bad all drugs are while skipping out on talkin about how bad the war is.<br /><br />Its ridiculus to me and they are dumbasses who have given up having fun in their lives just because governments said its bad to have fun but a war can be usefull to eliminate some fun and happiness.<br /><br />i dont know maybe its the acid and mushrooms that made me think alot but I have always said that weed stimulates thoughts, and it also stimulates the production of new braincells just like they wrote in the biggest sciencemagazine in Sweden a couple of years ago while nothing happened to the laws about cannabis. That magazine was visible in every store in Sweden yet people have no idea the be like -wtf is science?

				Doctors and psychologists have utterly and completely failed on me. Being unable to produce a proper diagnosis, prescribing me tons of medication that either doesn&#039;t work or even makes matters worse and utterly not caring about the patient.<br /><br />It&#039;s about time I started taking matters into my own hands.<br /><br />But now that I&#039;m here I&#039;ll likely also try other drugs. Just for fun, just to see what happens. As long as you don&#039;t do anything crazy there&#039;s really nothing to fear. And it&#039;s MY body. If I want to take some pills, I should be free to do so. If I want to smoke something, I should be free to do so. If I want to drink a bottle of bleach, I should be free to do so. Strangely, the bottle of bleach is the only one I&#039;m actually free to try according to the law.

				Great topic, and some great answers. +1&#039;s all around :)<br /><br />When I was younger I also had some different philosophies on drugs. On one hand, I was using drugs to expand my consciousness, but also, (and I didnt realize this till much later) I was using drugs as an escape. At one point, I had convinced myself that I *needed* drugs to achieve true enlightenment. Needless to say, I was wrong. Going down this misguided path led me into a lot of trouble.<br /><br />Eventually, I realized that you dont need drugs for true enlightenment. True enlightenment is achieved through hard work (meditation, for example), not by taking drugs. Taking drugs to achieve enlightenment is a bit like cheating, especially if you are not working towards enlightenment in any other way. Eventually I was able to let the drugs go and I began to seek enlightenment instead by medition, education, and excersise. <br /><br />Recently, I&#039;ve reacquainted myself with using drugs as a path towards enlightenment. This time however, my approach is a lot different. I am using restraint when it comes to my drug consumption. I am also taking much smaller quantities. But more importantly, I also spend a lot of time &quot;doing the work&quot; in RL, so to speak - the meditaion, education and excersize. When I take drugs for the purpose of achieving enlightenment (as opposed to just getting loaded) I also try to combine it with meditation. The results have been very encouraging, so far, and I think the main reason for that is my committment to actually putting in the work towards attaning that goal.<br /><br />That being said, , I also like to get loaded ;D<br /><br />For me, the key thing is to be able to differentiate between the two and to make deliberate choices. Man, I could go on and on about this topic... I think I&#039;ve said enough for now. Maybe I&#039;ll add more some other time :)

				When I was a kid, my parents repeated &quot;Drugs are bad, don&#039;t become a drughead.&quot;<br /><br />When I was a teenager, the story never changed. They even suspected I was trying something at some point. This was redacted later on, when they determined I was just being a teenager.<br /><br />Now I&#039;m neither a kid nor a teenager. I&#039;m a person with some education, and have still retained an incredible curiosity of the world, and the illicit, illegal and dangerous are now my focus. Drugs are nothing like what was described to me, but in a way they are. They&#039;re not a one-use-and-you&#039;re-hooked phenomenon, but they are the whole-other-perspective.<br /><br />I&#039;m just being curious, maybe a little being rebellious. Mostly just doing exactly what most are terrified of, because it means I will know something they don&#039;t, and might never know.<br /><br />Education above all, I guess. I could read about it, or I could do it and understand first hand.

				Life is hard.<br /><br />You need to live a little. <br /><br />Reward hard work with celebrations, embrace a social life, expand your mental philosophy beyond the sheep-like public.<br /><br />Disregard anyone who dares inhibit your right to your own body or decisions; freedom is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />Support revolutionary sites like Silk Road, who aim to empower the individual to easily obtain quality substances without some of the violence attributed to traditional drug dealing.<br /><br />There&#039;s a time and place for being sober, and that time and place is all too often at work/school/family.<br /><br />Who doesn&#039;t like to party? :)<br />

				The legendary Aldous Huxley says it best:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That humanity at large will ever be able to dispense with Artificial Paradises seems very unlikely. Most men and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best so monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul. Art and religion, carnivals and saturnalia, dancing and listening to oratory--all these have served, in H. G. Wells&#039;s phrase, as Doors in the Wall. And for private, far everyday use there have always been chemical intoxicants. All the vegetable sedatives and narcotics, all the euphorics that grow on trees, the hallucinogens that ripen in berries or can be squeezed from roots--all, without exception, have been known and systematically used by human beings from time immemorial. And to these natural modifiers of consciousness modern science has added its quota of synthetics--chloral, for example, and benzedrine, the bromides and the barbiturates.<br /><br />Most of these modifiers of consciousness cannot now be taken except under doctor&#039;s orders, or else illegally and at considerable risk. For unrestricted use the West has permitted only alcohol and tobacco. All the other chemical Doors in the Wall are labeled Dope, and their unauthorized takers are Fiends.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />To that, I would add Timothy Leary&#039;s two commandments:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thou shalt not alter the consciousness of thy neighbor without his or her consent.<br /><br />Thou shalt not prevent thy neighbor from altering his or her own consciousness.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And my own opinion - Drugs can be fun, why not do them? There is no good moral case for not doing drugs as a matter of dogma, though I can see that some drugs can give some people problems just as some people become alcoholics. But as a general rule, do what gives you the maximum amount of happiness, while avoiding reducing other people&#039;s happiness.

				I&#039;ve always said I&#039;m not addicted to any one drug, I&#039;m just addicted to being fucked up in general. To dig a little deeper, I guess it&#039;s just as simple as being addicted to constantly escaping the monotony of everyday life and responsibilities.<br /><br />Now that I live somewhere where I can&#039;t access drugs as easily (except here), I find myself being forced to face reality. I&#039;ve been clean for months (with the exception of drinking and one weekend of coke bingin &amp; bangin). I quit buying cigarettes. I&#039;ve got a better hold on my drinking. However, the mental obsession still makes me pretty miserable I guess...<br /><br />In the end, the answers are all within yourself. Drugs were a &quot;tool&quot; for me at first, but they always turn against you in the end.

If the answers do not come from within, and they do not come from drugs, then what?<br /><br />There are no answers. Or perhaps it&#039;s just that some people have the answers, and always have. And others don&#039;t, and never will. Maybe it&#039;s just a roll of the dice.

				My philosophy behind my illicit drug use goes hand-in-hand with my general life philosophy. There is only but one life. <br />And not only is the life we have too short, but there is no possible way to explore every aspect it curtails and experience of it. I could only wish it did.<br />In the limited, scarce amount of time I have, I would like to experiment and cave in to almost every desire I have. If I&#039;m curious about something, I want to learn about it, I want to quench my interest. I do not want to regret not having experienced something. Whether the experience is negative, rewarding, breathtaking, or horrifying, I will not regret it.<br />We learn from every step we take.<br />

				At some point in time I decided I don&#039;t want to feel guilty or even criminal just for smoking cannabis. It always felt right. That was a great day. :)<br />I like to use cannabis instead of alcohol, which would be legal in my country, but I want to choose myself and not being taught that I have to drink alcohol when I want to have a drug.<br />Also it is a fact that alcohol is so much worse for your body than cannabis could ever be. And alcohol has a strong addiction once you are addicted, no thank you Germany, I don&#039;t want to join this nation of alcoholics.<br /><br />Nowadays I&#039;m always thinking about article 1 and article 2 of the German constitution which should guarantee me the freedom of using any drug I want, no matter if it does damage to me or not.<br /><br />I don&#039;t feel any guilt or shame or anything negative about my drug usage as of today.

				&nbsp;I am a &quot;drug addict&quot; because the lovely USA powers that be think it was okay to feed me speed as a child, against my will (initially) in pill form and after they provided it to me for several years of my childhood and early adulthood the dock suddenly decided no more speed for me and now all these years later I have to risk my freedom in order to maintain the addiction they started. Now I am considered a criminal for simply doing what is 100% necessary for me to function and live as a happy individual, as I was prior to being drugged by my teachers, guidance counselors, doctor, and society.<br />&nbsp; Why the hell is it legal and common and considered totally acceptable to feed innocent children speed against their will but very illegal (punished with violence and force) for a grown adult to even so much as possess let alone take speed, or whatever else they decide to put in their OWN body?<br />&nbsp; I have heard the arguments so many times of how drugs cause people to do bad shit and all the crime that drug addicts&nbsp; can be blamed on and I know people do some fucked up shit for drugs sometimes but why don&#039;t we focus laws and enforcement toward the crimes and people who commit them. maybe they would not get as much seized assets but I would rather they catch and punish the guys robbing and raping.<br />&nbsp; If someone is capable of functioning as a stand up citizen and chooses to work for a living and put chems in their own body that harms nobody.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve never had a &#039;drug&#039; problem, at least I don&#039;t believe I have.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The extent of my drug use is as follows. Weed, LSD, DMT, Shrooms, Alcohol, Tobacco, Painkillers, and Fake Weed(back when I was 16 and didn&#039;t know better) <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah at one point last year I was smoking weed almost all day every day for a few months straight... So what, I was in college. Yeah I would skip class and smoke weed. But I wasn&#039;t skipping class to smoke weed. I was skipping class because I wanted to. The weed wasn&#039;t telling me to not go to class. I was working, I was paying rent and bills, I was going to class occasionally, lol, and yeah I was smoking pot all day. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately it wasn&#039;t until last year that I finally decided to try psychedelics, I really wish I would have got into them in high school. I had a lot more free time to trip then. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#039;t smoke weed anymore due to my job, so I&#039;m basically stuck with alcohol and psychedelics until the end of next summer when I go back to school. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I never really needed an excuse for why I used drugs, nor did I have one. I didn&#039;t grow up rich, but we weren&#039;t living on food stamps. I have good relationships with my parents. I didn&#039;t do the best in high school, but I made my way by. I had plenty of friends and was never really depressed until the passing of my grandmother two years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn&#039;t using drugs as an escape, I was using them to simply make things more fun. Yeah I could sit here and watch this TV show and be somewhat amused. Or I could smoke a jay and laugh my ass off at some pointless shit and have a great time. Who are you to tell me I can&#039;t enjoy myself? <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Psychedelics are a whole different story. The more I trip the more confused I get on why I trip. Every time I trip I ask myself why I do it and I can never make up my mind. Sometimes I feel like I&#039;m looking for something, something that cannot be found in &#039;reality.&#039; My mind has taken me to some very strange places while tripping and it has opened all kinds of doors in my head and made me think completely outside the box. One thing I always try to do is keep my &#039;tripping world&#039; and &#039;reality&#039; separate. Yeah sometimes I&#039;ll lay in bed and think about shit I saw and realized when I was tripping, but who doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other side of things, I enjoy tripping just because I am amazed by what my mind, mixed with a few drugs, can come up with. Like why the fuck are my closed eyed visuals on a good acid trip the most beautiful thing I have ever seen? Why can&#039;t I even fathom what it is? Where is my brain coming up with this shit?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DMT.... I have only tripped DMT twice so I can&#039;t speak too much for it. I plan on ordering a gram soon though. But DMT.... what the fuck??? Like I try to think level headed sometimes, but this shit makes me wonder what god created this drug. <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, I&#039;m on some painkillers right now and I feel like I just randomly blabbled for a while and I&#039;m not sure if any of that makes sense, but I hope it does haha.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for drugs being illegal, who the fuck are you to say what I can and can&#039;t put in my body. Fuck you government.<br /><br />#FreeAdamKokesh<br />#HashtagOnSRwtfDogYouStupid?<br /><br />~Psychedelic

				I once had a room mate who was in his 30&#039;s and had been a daily pot smoker the entire 5+ years I knew him and another 10 or so years before I met him as well. He even took o few hits from his bong every morning before he even got out his bed, puffed on lunch break at work and again after work, hadn&#039;t missed a day in about 15yrs.<br />&nbsp; It really didn&#039;t seem to make him lazy or even seem like he was stoned most of the time either and he was totally content with his ways.<br />&nbsp;After 5yrs living there and being a friend and all I convinced the dude to take a break just to see what its like not smoking all day.

				I used to tell myself that I was taking drugs for this purpose or that purpose.&nbsp; To loosen up, or to explore my mind, or whatever.&nbsp; And I did learn a lot from taking psychedelics (and I&#039;m still learning).<br /><br />That said I eventually I realized I was a drug addict.&nbsp; That I get bored with things and I like to get high to escape my problems or just to pass the time (boredom being my ultimate problem).<br /><br />So now I stick to the least destructive drugs I know of, psychedelics and weed.&nbsp; I get bored with being sober all the time and sometimes I just want to relax and see some pretty colors.
