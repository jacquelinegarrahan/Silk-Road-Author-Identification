				I usually love Fridays. Its the last day of work because I rarely work weekends. <br /><br />So, today we had an easy day until some idiot customer comes back in with &#039;a few questions&#039;. I get asked to deal with him. Cannot say what we make but the customer was basically puzzled over how to turn the damn machine on.<br /><br />In fact, he was not only puzzled, the guy was annoying, he spent half an hour bragging about how great he was. You know the sort, full of themselves.<br /><br />I have a low tolerance for idiots and realised I&#039;d been set up. The lads and girls were laughing as they had dealt with this dingbat before. <br /><br />And then, after that, I get a cup of coffee with 2 sugars. I don&#039;t take sugar. <br /><br />To top it all off, I sneaked out for a joint of hash. On the way out, I get blasted with a water gun by one of the guys.<br /><br />But, on a good note, I went outside and found a nice fat slug. I went to the canteen, slipped that slug onto the salad bowl of Mr Water Gun. His face was a picture. He never ate it but will now have to spend the afternoon getting wound up. <br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />On a darker note, we cannot sneak out today until around 3.00pm. Booked in till 5.00pm, so we get paid, but I like to sneak off maybe 1.30pm, get home, grab a shower, cook the evening meal and be in the pub for 7-8.00pm.<br /><br />The boss is a cool guy. Bit of a cokehead (weekends only) but at least that gives us the right to smoke a sly joint with his permission as long as we get the work done and only if its not working at height (we stay sober for that shit)<br /><br />Hate getting up at 5.30am for certain jobs. That means I stay sober the night before. Wish we had cars from the future which just drove us to wherever whilst we sit back, roll a joint and listen to some good music.<br /><br />Wish we had robots to do the work.<br /><br />Wish we had free beer and maidens with silver trays of fine bud and hash.<br /><br />And wish we had cooler weather. Don&#039;t like the heat myself. We should ban that also.<br /><br />I get irritable in work sometimes. <br /><br />But the more you look at the clock the longer it seems.<br /><br />I took the clock off our rest room wall. Should have stuck it up tjhe bosses ass.<br /><br />I hate his pet dog also. It frayed my sleeves on my shirt. <br /><br />Bah!

				I actually have a pretty laid back job.<br /><br />And as for smoking weed at work, I will go through a pipeful while having a cigarette break at least twice a shift.&nbsp; If I forget my weed and pipe, it&#039;s a rough fucking day sometimes.&nbsp; What is worse, is when I have everything except........<br /><br />A lighter.&nbsp; I am the ONLY one who smokes tobacco at work, so no help from my co-workers in that department.<br /><br />I also don&#039;t like having to get to bed so fucking early.&nbsp; If I stay up past 30 pm, that&#039;s staying up late for me.&nbsp; Like tonight for example.<br /><br /><br />
