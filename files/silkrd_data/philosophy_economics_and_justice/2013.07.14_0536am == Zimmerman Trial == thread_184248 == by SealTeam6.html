				The jury did the right thing. Zimmerman was clearly acting in self-defense when he shot Martin.<br /><br />It should never have been brought to trial to begin wtih. This entire thing was primed by the media trying to frame the trayvon killing as being something like a KKK lynching.

				So why is so quick to not notice Zimmerman&#039;s extreme Hispanic-ness? Because black people know only too well that when you flash-mob Hispanics, they&#039;ll kill you right back - that ghetto-hoodrat act don&#039;t even faze your typical cucaracha, who&#039;s got even less love for boolies than Egyptian cab drivers. And chimping-out is supposed to be fun - shootin&#039; white fish in a barrel, most too terrified even to hit back.<br /><br />Hispanics know what white Southerners used to know - show a negro some backbone and he runs....that&#039;s why the only mentions of Zimmerman&#039;s ethnicity you&#039;ll read will mostly be in sidebars you&#039;ll hopefully ignore.

				My understanding is:&nbsp; Zimmerman was doing his neighbourhood watch thing in a gated community, sees a guy who he deems suspicious, confronts him.&nbsp; Martin comes back a few minutes later and starts kicking the shit out of Zimmerman, who then shoots the Martin dead.<br /><br />I&#039;d call that manslaughter.&nbsp; I have no idea how it&#039;s been painted as some kind of cold blooding racist killing in the media.<br /><br />Surely this is the exact scenario that people use to justify the right to bare arms?

				&quot;Casing the place for a burglary&quot; LOL come on man you really believe that? I agree with the verdict and I also agree that Martin was wrong in his decision to fight Z which is what ultimately caused his death..But I don&#039;t think the guy was casing the area lol! He was a black dude walking home and didn&#039;t like the fact that some strange guy was harassing him. So he did what society tells a young black dude to do, act gangsta and whoop that ass . When I say that I mean I believe black culture is as much to blame in his death than he and Z are. The music, the tv, and everything else has black people thinkin they must be hard and gangsta for some reason. Its all macho shit. And its all wrong. Pretty sad. The black community needs to address the problems with this type of mentality that so many seem to have. That is the root to many many black problems imo.. And no Im not black, just no many and have dealed with so many my whole life.

				Has anyone noticed that, in typical fashion, the grounds for outrage keep subtly shifting?<br /><br />Month 1- &quot;A crazed white vigilante murdered an innocent, angelic boy!&quot;. Then it turned out that Martin wasn&#039;t so innocent or angelic, and was for all practical purposes a man, not a boy. Zimmerman was also revealed to be not so crazed and not so white. So that angle was dropped.<br /><br />Later- &quot;It&#039;s those awful &#039;Stand your Ground&#039; laws, that&#039;s what&#039;s wrong!&quot;. But the defense didn&#039;t even need to mention that law at trial, because was totally irrelevant to the case. That line was abandoned pretty swiftly by the smart media players, though some stragglers still haven&#039;t wrapped their heads around it yet.<br /><br />During the trial (after it became clear that there was no way to prove murder)- &quot;Zimmerman recklessly provoked a confrontation, ignoring police instructions!&quot;. But police testified that he cooperated fully and followed all their instructions, and the jury subsequently agreed.<br /><br />After the acquittal: &quot;Anyone who is going to carry a deadly weapon should be more careful, and more knowledgeable!&quot; i.e., GZ was a little bit of a bumbling incompetent, which is more-or-less true.<br /><br />This kind of &quot;outrage distillation&quot; is common when the press push a bullshit narrative and then discover that they were mostly wrong. They can&#039;t continue lying, but they can focus the same amount of anger and opprobrium onto smaller and smaller sins.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=184248.msg1340007#msg1340007">Quote from: subsrgood on July 15, 2013, 01:34 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Florida has the worst justice system...

				Ok..... my 2 cents<br /><br />In the community where Zimmerman was &quot;watching&quot; over it is plagued with theft from young, black males. Zimmerman, seeing Trayvon, approached him and then was getting his ass whooped by Trayvon- who by the way was training at a local boxing gym. <br /><br />If you listen to the 911 tapes you can hear Zimmerman screaming in terror for his life, because Trayvon had him pinned underneath him and proceeded to beat his face and slam it up and off the concrete. Legally, It all boils down to whether or not Zimmerman took the necessary force to save his life in self defense. None of the issues leading up to the confrontation are of any legal value. The jurors, after hearing all of the evidence, came to the conclusion that Zimmerman acted &quot;rightly&quot; in deciding to fire his weapon. Hence, why they found him not guilty. This is not an issue of race. Had it been Mexican&#039;s who were stealing and robbing from the community it would be the same issue. Did Zimmerman act &quot;rightly&quot; in self defense. I believe he did.<br /><br />It&#039;s sad that the media wants to portray this as a race issue, when more black on black crime is committed all over the US.

				There is already another High Profile Stand Your Ground trial about to begin where a white guy killed a black guy in &quot;Self -Defense&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp; This one seems a little bit more cut and dry, but you never know with Florida&#039;s judicial system.<br /><br />http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/07/trayvon-martin-jordan-davis-stand-your-ground<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A white man named Michael Dunn shot and killed an unarmed black teenager named Jordan Davis in Florida last year after a brief dispute. The prosecutor overseeing the case is Florida state attorney Angela Corey. Dunn, who will be tried for murder, claims the shooting was in self-defense. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Now that the state&#039;s nationally televised and notorious self-defense case has ended with the acquittal of defendant George Zimmerman, a next potentially high-profile test of the state&#039;s criminal-justice system may come when Dunn goes on trial for first-degree murder this September. And while Florida&#039;s controversial Stand Your Ground gun law didn&#039;t in the end figure into the Zimmerman decision, it may be tested in the Dunn case.<br /><br />The killing took place in November 2012, while Dunn was parked at a gas station convenience store, waiting for his girlfriend to emerge from inside. Four teenagers, including 17-year-old Davis, were parked* next to Dunn&#039;s car in an SUV. After an argument over the teens&#039; loud music, Dunn fired on the boys from his car, killing Davis. Dunn claims he opened fire only after one of the teens threatened his life, brandished a gun, and started to exit the SUV. Later he told police that he had &quot;never been so scared&quot; in his life.<br /><br />The Davis family attorney, John Phillips, told HLN recently that Davis&#039; parents are &quot;freaking out about justice&quot; after the Zimmerman verdict. But in another HLN interview, he cautioned that the two cases aren&#039;t identical, saying &quot;the justice process is different for both. You gotta keep them separate.&quot;<br /><br />He&#039;s right—there are some crucial distinctions. No one but Zimmerman and Martin himself bore witness to Zimmerman pulling the trigger. But there were several eyewitnesses to the Davis killing, including his three friends who survived. Despite Dunn&#039;s claim that one of the victims had a gun, police recovered no weapon, and witnesses say no one involved got out of a vehicle except for Dunn, who allegedly did so as he fired his final shots. Instead of calling 911 or waiting for police to arrive, Dunn then fled the scene with his girlfriend, went back to his hotel and ate pizza, and later returned to his home without calling police. Whereas Zimmerman walked free for nearly six weeks and was only arrested and charged after a national outcry, police arrested Dunn the day after he killed Davis.<br /><br />Corey has been under fire over the outcomes of two self-defense cases she recently oversaw. Since the Zimmerman verdict, some critics have blasted her for charging him in the first place, while others argue that her team didn&#039;t present the case against him effectively. Zimmerman&#039;s case has been likened to another one handled under Corey in 2012: that of Marissa Alexander, a black woman who tried to use Stand Your Ground as her defense against aggravated assault charges. She said she fired a warning shot into a wall to fend off her abusive estranged husband; she was sentenced to 20 years in prison for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Corey claims there are &quot;zero parallels&quot; between the two cases.<br /><br />In the upcoming Dunn trial, the issue of race is obvious to Davis&#039; mother, Lucia McBath, but she told HLN&#039;s Raising America recently that it should not be the main focus.<br /><br />&quot;It&#039;s apparent that Michael Dunn is white, it&#039;s apparent that Jordan is black,&quot; McBath said. &quot;But the issue is the Stand Your Ground laws. The issue is not the racial part of it. We&#039;re not going to center and focus on that, because that doesn&#039;t do any good for the country. We&#039;re not going to incite racism in this country. The bigger picture is making a change in the laws so that…this doesn&#039;t continue to happen.&quot;&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Am I allowed to reveal my race or is that a breach of etiquette here? No matter. The fact of the matter is two idiots decided to be idiots and when their idiocy collided it left death in its wake. They were both wrong. Trayvon should&#039;ve taken his black ass home. Zimmerman should&#039;ve stayed in his vehicle and hung back. His lack of training made this situation into what it turned out to be. He could&#039;ve obtained visuals from his vehicle there was no need to follow a potentially dangerous person on foot. Was profiling involved? Perhaps but we profile all of the time when we recognize recurring patterns. So I&#039;m not as mad as most of the other people I talk to about it. Then again I&#039;m not mad at all and can&#039;t even be real about it.

				Regardless what the verdict is, Zimmerman is still going to have to deal with the national attention, death threats, and racism (against him). A name change, basic appearance change and relocation is probably necessary for any type of return to a normal life. Probably not just him to, his family and whoever else was part of trial. Also all the money to have that done, not to mention his legal fees, and the interrogations and police involvement he was already a part of before the verdict.<br /><br />I&#039;m on his side, race shouldn&#039;t really matter in this, but now that the verdict is in, the Martin&#039;s have no other option but to make it a racial issue. This whole thing is really a step backwards in society, if you ask me.<br /><br />

				I didn&#039;t follow the trial but I read up on the case prior to the trial, and have read the news since it. I think that Zimmerman acted foolishly in a few ways. Getting out of his car and following Trayvon was a bad idea, but maybe he was just trying to keep track of his location to help the police find him. Trayvon was almost certainly a burglar since he was previously found at school to have dozens of pieces of stolen jewelry, but who knows if he was casing houses or not, it is a bit irrelevant to the confrontation between Zimmerman and him. I think Trayvon was probably panicked that somebody was following him for whatever reason, he had no clue who Zimmerman was, etc. I don&#039;t think Trayvon really did anything particularly wrong in that he wasn&#039;t out looking to get in a fight and he probably felt some level of threatened, so he himself could have argued self defense if he lived through the ordeal, although it seems like he went way overboard given the perceived threat so he would have probably been convicted of at least assault and perhaps aggravated assault. But I can&#039;t really blame Zimmerman for shooting him. If somebody is on top of you beating on you, maybe you shouldn&#039;t shoot them if it is just a normal ass kicking. But when you start slamming somebodies head into concrete you are pretty much attempting to kill them or cause them serious brain damage. I have no doubt that Zimmerman felt in fear of his life, and it isn&#039;t like he did anything illegal or even particularly warranting of an ass kicking by following Trayvon, so for the most part Trayvon tried to kill Zimmerman after being spooked by him and somewhat provoked, and he ended up dying because Zimmerman had a gun. If he had just punched him in the face and brought him to the ground and then stopped, he should not have been shot. But he went way overboard and it seems like Zimmerman wasn&#039;t even really fighting back, was pinned to the ground and had his head repeatedly smashed into concrete, so although a violent reaction by Trayvon would have been justified, he took it way too far and escalated it to such a point that Zimmerman was perfectly justified in elevating his own confrontation to deadly force. Trayvon is the one who escalated things.

If anything this is a great example of why guns should be legal.

				I could&#039;ve been on the bad side of an incident as I was robbed for 6 zips of molly. I had 4 guns held to my head by 4 shakey-handed niggas....for what tho? There was no malice in my mind, as I ignored the signs that somethin like this was gonna happen. When I got home, I used my backup cell and texted that fool. Basically, he said he robbed me because he got robbed the week prior and then told me to &quot;Go teach someone else a lesson&quot;....shit made me sick to my stomach cause I can see that faggot being one of those people who blacked out his facebook page &quot;in tribute&quot; to Trayvon Martin....basically sayin, &quot;Oh I can treat my black people the way I want to but it isn&#039;t ok for other races to do the same.&quot; Get real<br /><br />I know that innocent people are killed every minute, but I never looked at the Trayvon case from a racial standpoint. As someone stated earlier, there were wrong doings by both parties....And just like innocent people are killed, cases are wrongfully trialled. Because in the end....it&#039;s not about what you know...IT&#039;S ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN PROVE. <br /><br />In my opinion, truth is proof and proof is in education...especially for black people. <br /><br />&quot;A System Cannot Fail Those It Was Never Meant to Protect.&quot;<br />The sooner some of you racnegroes realize this, the more consolidated we will be as black people. Take accountability and stop blaming the world for problems. This whole Martin case made me put together an organization in the troubled neighborhoods of my city. Hoping to make a difference locally. Cause most people aren&#039;t doin shit but spectating and speculating. <br /><br />P.S.....the media is a shit stream...

				The two tragedies of the Martin shooting are that a young man is dead. The second is that the media in the US and beyond have completely unnecessarily turned this into a wider racial conflict which is resulting in further race-related violence and animosity. <br /><br />The mainstream media in the US have a lot to answer for. They are the ones who cast Zimmerman as the &quot;white&quot;. Has anyone ever heard of the ethnic descriptor &quot;white-Hispanic&quot; prior to the Martin shooting? Fuck no. If some white guy gunned down Zimmerman in an altercation, you can bet your house the Hispanic advocacy groups would be describing him as a Latino, not a &quot;white-Hispanic&quot;. Why don&#039;t we ever hear that Obama is the first &quot;white-black&quot; president? And let&#039;s not forget that Zimmerman&#039;s Peruvian grandmother is half African, meaning that Zimmerman has enough African ancestry to be eligible for the affirmative action enrolment credits offered to African-Americans at most US universities. <br /><br />But no, what we&#039;ve all been presented with by much of the mainstream media is that the white guy murdered the black child. What a simplistic analysis.<br /><br />Shit, you gotta feel sorry for Zimmerman. I mean, imagine if we alter just one aspect of history - that&nbsp; George&#039;s mother was white and his father was Latino. That means he would be George Mesa. And we wouldn&#039;t be having this conversation, because we would never have heard of George Mesa or Trayvon Martin. A Latino guns down a black ... well it&#039;s just another day in the &#039;hood. Slow news day. Wait for the retaliation, or don&#039;t. It&#039;s so predictable it&#039;d be barely newsworthy within the county, let alone the state. <br /><br />But a white spastic cop murders an angelic black kid - now there&#039;s a national (make that international) story with legs. And with a name like &#039;George Zimmerman&#039;, it&#039;s too easy to paint him as a white. A few days later and the slightly inconvenient fact that he&#039;s on the electoral roll as a Hispanic and a registered Democrat emerges. Thankfully, his father&#039;s white, and his family name&#039;s Zimmerman, for god&#039;s sake. How white can you get? Oh, the mother. OK so he&#039;s &#039;white-Hispanic&#039;.<br /><br />And then there are the two photos of Martin that the media runs constantly. One is of him looking angelic when he was about 12. The other is a poignant shot of him in a hoodie. Martin&#039;s family went to great lengths to ensure no recent photos of Martin were released with him showing his teeth. Why? Because he had a dirty great grill. And he enjoyed gangsta poses. This of course proves nothing, but it undermines the choirboy image the media projects. We are being fed The Narrative they&#039;ve decided upon, and photos of a 16 year old trying very hard to look as badass as possible (an image that most 16 year old boys the world over either cultivate or would like to cultivate) don&#039;t support The Narrative. So these photos which show another side of the Real Trayvon don&#039;t see the light of day.<br /><br />From what I know of the case, it&#039;s clear there&#039;s reasonable doubt Zimmerman did not murder Martin. Nope, not even manslaughter. There is no evidence that Zimmerman ever intended to harm Martin. Zimmerman claims that he was on his way back to his car when he was ambushed by Martin. No one is able to contradict this. There is no evidence that Zimmerman was lying about this, even though he may have been. But the threshold is reasonable doubt that Zimmerman was the aggressor. This was clearly not established, and could never have been established given what was presented in court (as well as what was in the public domain prior to the trial!) Zimmerman&#039;s head injuries to his face and the back of his head - which received practically no coverage in the mainstream media - were consistent with his account that Martin was beating the shit out of him; he was on the ground being punched in the face and his head was being slammed into the pavement by Martin who was straddling him. Then Zimmerman shot him because he claimed Martin was going for his gun. One man&#039;s word - there were no witnesses to the shooting. <br /><br />And therein lay the problem for the prosecution. There was evidence that corroborated some of Zimmerman&#039;s version of events. Other parts of what he says happened....well all we have is his word. The prosecution&#039;s version of events is either supported by extremely weak evidence or is provided in the form of supposition by someone who was not there, did not see what happened, and has constructed a scenario that would make Zimmerman guilty of murdering Martin. Oh dear. Beyond reasonable doubt - that&#039;s what the jury had to decide upon. Not a chance. Given the above, Zimmerman should never have been charged, let alone faced court. He simply wouldn&#039;t have been tried if the case wasn&#039;t so massively politicised.<br /><br />It&#039;s a terrible, terrible event that&#039;s set race relations back years. So unnecessarily. And it&#039;s primarily the mainstream media&#039;s fault. They&#039;re the ones that framed this shooting as a &quot;white on black crime&quot;. I bet they made a shitload of money out of this circus. <br /><br />And you know what? The real elephant in the room is black on black killings. The Martin shooting was not necessarily a crime, but it&#039;s obvious that white people commit crimes that cause the death of innocent black people like Trayvon. <br /><br />But for every one such case, there would be 10 or (possibly many) more incidents where innocent black people die from crimes committed by blacks. We don&#039;t talk about this much, however. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, they&#039;re all pretty quiet about that. They&#039;ll talk for as long as you&#039;ll listen about George Zimmerman, however. Hell they&#039;re still talking after everyone&#039;s left the room, the silly old blowhards.<br /><br />The whole thing is a deeply, deeply sordid and cynical affair driven by the lure of ratings hikes by inflaming racial division - and doesn&#039;t that result in a few nice fat paychecks for the leaders of the Victim Industry?<br />
