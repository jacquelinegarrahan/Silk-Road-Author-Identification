			<dd class="postbody">
				Edward Snowden is a bad-ass.<br /><br /><br />Snowden issued a stinging response to accusations from former Vice President Dick Cheney and others that he is a “traitor.” He said, “It’s important to bear in mind that I’m being called a traitor by men like former Vice President Dick Cheney. This is a man who gave us the warrantless wiretapping scheme as a kind of atrocity warm-up on the way to deceitfully engineering a conflict that has killed over 4,400 and maimed nearly 32,000 Americans, as well as leaving over 100,000 Iraqis dead.<br /><br />“Being called a traitor by Dick Cheney is the highest honor you can give an American, and the more panicked talk we hear from people like him, [Democratic Senator Dianne] Feinstein, and [Republican Representative Peter] King, the better off we all are. If they had taught a class on how to be the kind of citizen Dick Cheney worries about, I would have finished high school.”

				NSA spying is not really news but for those to who it was Edward Snowden is a hero. I&#039;ve always figured they&#039;re doing this shit, and many years ago there was a whistleblower talking about wire splits at ISPs for the NSA, and the most that happened is Dog&#039;s Barked.<br /><br />I think we&#039;re facing so much evil people are only starting to see what good is. So this time the news set off alarm bells for us all. The fight is getting stronger, horrah!

				This has been the norm in the U.S. for a while.&nbsp; Funny how now that it&#039;s a black president, it&#039;s a scandal!&nbsp; It&#039;s all smoke and mirrors folks, but I do still believe much good can come from it.&nbsp; You cannot hide the truth forever.&nbsp; This truth coupled with all the neg publicity the war on drugs is currently receiving has to lead to some sort of change.&nbsp;

				Slow down, guys. Please, slow down. First, my rant... then my deeper considerations.<br /><br />1. Has Edward Snowden provided any proof of what he claims?<br /><br />I&#039;m not convinced. If he is legit, then I want to be convinced. I want evidence that what he describes is not only possible but being abused.<br /><br />If there are communications that could be captured and deciphered, and those illegal wiretaps sniff out terrorists, then it should NOT be secret. We need to be shown that it isn&#039;t being abused.... (I believe that every system will always be abused... we&#039;re all too human.)... This is fucked at best, but Snowden is a media hound and a political tool until proven otherwise.<br /><br />Terrorists... China... Big Brother... Fuck... I guess I really don&#039;t give a fuck in the end because I use 4096+ RSA, etc, etc. I&#039;m not trying to overthrow the current world order... <br /><br />2. Most of the human population will (probably) always be disadvantaged... What I want to do is equip those who want security with the tools to do so. I guess Snowden is the crusader that makes the need to take responsibility and action, so I&#039;ll give him that. He is a great scare monger. We need that. Not everyone on the Road is stepping up their own game in the face of adversity that we face. Most of us here already know the story that Snowden is telling, albeit with no proof (yet).<br /><br />OK. But... NSA doesn&#039;t share their secrets with FBI, DHS, LEOs... It would reveal their power... their secrets. It would also create public nightmares like Snowden is claiming. NSA doesn&#039;t go after harmless marijuana users that find the Road to be a godsend from the old way of narcotic acquisition. They target geopolitical threats to US stability....... Jesus, this is getting to be a bigger post than I thought. Let me chew on that, and I&#039;ll wait for replies before continuing...

Please, slow down. First, my rant... then my deeper considerations.<br /><br />1. Has Edward Snowden provided any proof of what he claims?<br /><br />I&#039;m not convinced. If he is legit, then I want to be convinced. I want evidence that what he describes is not only possible but being abused.<br /><br />If there are communications that could be captured and deciphered, and those illegal wiretaps sniff out terrorists, then it should NOT be secret. We need to be shown that it isn&#039;t being abused.... (I believe that every system will always be abused... we&#039;re all too human.)... This is fucked at best, but Snowden is a media hound and a political tool until proven otherwise.<br /><br />Terrorists... China... Big Brother... Fuck... I guess I really don&#039;t give a fuck in the end because I use 4096+ RSA, etc, etc. I&#039;m not trying to overthrow the current world order... <br /><br />2. Most of the human population will (probably) always be disadvantaged... What I want to do is equip those who want security with the tools to do so. I guess Snowden is the crusader that makes the need to take responsibility and action, so I&#039;ll give him that. He is a great scare monger. We need that. Not everyone on the Road is stepping up their own game in the face of adversity that we face. Most of us here already know the story that Snowden is telling, albeit with no proof (yet).<br /><br />OK. But... NSA doesn&#039;t share their secrets with FBI, DHS, LEOs... It would reveal their power... their secrets. It would also create public nightmares like Snowden is claiming. NSA doesn&#039;t go after harmless marijuana users that find the Road to be a godsend from the old way of narcotic acquisition. They target geopolitical threats to US stability....... Jesus, this is getting to be a bigger post than I thought. Let me chew on that, and I&#039;ll wait for replies before continuing...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />I think he is legit, but i must agree on the NSA stuff.....they pretty much own the internet, and they definitely own TOR, because with a few million dollars i could own TOR, there simply is not enough exit nodes, mathematically, if only 10% of the 3000 odd exit nodes are compromised, you will exit from one of those corrupted nodes at least once a week if you log on every day. VPN may help, but i doubt it. In all probability i think the NSA already knows everyone on the road, down to your address and phone number, it&#039;s just not important enough to the NSA for them to do anything which might give away control to the people they are really after.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />When you use a hidden service you don&#039;t go through an exit node.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I don&#039;t want to split hairs, but TOR traffic can be captured like any other network traffic. The creators of TOR most likely monitor traffic, and we shouldn&#039;t get too confortable with the idea that we are entirely secure via hidden services.<br /><br />Be vigilant.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Traffic to hidden services is end to end encrypted. I highly doubt the creators of Tor monitor traffic, and even if they tried to there would be no way for them to monitor much of it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />kmfkewm I usually love your posts and I&#039;ve learnt a great deal from them but I have to disagree with this and I think I even read this in one of your posts or replies. From what I understand and correct me if I&#039;m wrong is everything on Tor is encrypted except the exit nodes so it wouldn&#039;t be that communications could be intercepted at that point and if it not encrypted it would be a bad situation. Also the Tor network can be analysed by your above average computer user with open source tools.Tor is a great tool don&#039;t get me wrong but it&#039;s not the holy grail of privacy and anonymity but it sure is a great step in the right direction. The other thing is I really don&#039;t like to say this but I think sometimes you overestimate the NSA. I know you guys think I&#039;m stupid for saying that but I realize how powerful they are but for them to have ever User &amp; Vendors contact info and a log of their activity seems far fethced to me at best. Granted they&#039;re powers of surveillance are astounding that would still take some serious effort and man hours to infiltrate the Tor Network and SR. With that being said though I&#039;m sure if they had a reason or proper motivation they could bring the whole ship down in less than a week.&nbsp; 8)

				Well if you believe what you hear on the news he is still in Russia. Supposedly in some state of limbo. Not sure if I missed something but either they&#039;re trying to make his whereabouts really obscure cause they know where he is or they really don&#039;t know. On a side note a former russian spy has announced that she would like to marry Snowden. After reviewing her pictures I would say that&#039;s his get out of jail free card, she&#039;s pretty damn fine if I do say so myself.<br /><br />Or also it could be the Russians have him somewhere secure, told the US to fuck off and that&#039;s not exactly something the US can let the whole world know about.

Please, slow down. First, my rant... then my deeper considerations.<br /><br />1. Has Edward Snowden provided any proof of what he claims?<br /><br />I&#039;m not convinced. If he is legit, then I want to be convinced. I want evidence that what he describes is not only possible but being abused.<br /><br />If there are communications that could be captured and deciphered, and those illegal wiretaps sniff out terrorists, then it should NOT be secret. We need to be shown that it isn&#039;t being abused.... (I believe that every system will always be abused... we&#039;re all too human.)... This is fucked at best, but Snowden is a media hound and a political tool until proven otherwise.<br /><br />Terrorists... China... Big Brother... Fuck... I guess I really don&#039;t give a fuck in the end because I use 4096+ RSA, etc, etc. I&#039;m not trying to overthrow the current world order... <br /><br />2. Most of the human population will (probably) always be disadvantaged... What I want to do is equip those who want security with the tools to do so. I guess Snowden is the crusader that makes the need to take responsibility and action, so I&#039;ll give him that. He is a great scare monger. We need that. Not everyone on the Road is stepping up their own game in the face of adversity that we face. Most of us here already know the story that Snowden is telling, albeit with no proof (yet).<br /><br />OK. But... NSA doesn&#039;t share their secrets with FBI, DHS, LEOs... It would reveal their power... their secrets. It would also create public nightmares like Snowden is claiming. NSA doesn&#039;t go after harmless marijuana users that find the Road to be a godsend from the old way of narcotic acquisition. They target geopolitical threats to US stability....... Jesus, this is getting to be a bigger post than I thought. Let me chew on that, and I&#039;ll wait for replies before continuing...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I worked for one of the largest state governments in the US, in a similar capacity as Snowden, and I can tell you firsthand that what he is revealing is ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. Belive everything he says. Imagine waaaay more. It&#039;s being done. And yes, nsa does share their secrets. Government employees share information. IRS shares information. Our government is more blatantly corrupt than any throughout history.<br />And yes, government agencies ARE stupid, filled with stupid people who lack imagination. Spying on your citizens is not the way to gather intelligence. It&#039;s the easiest, which is why it&#039;s being done. And I&#039;m afraid it will only get worse because as we all know, only half of the population belives it&#039;s going on. The other half has their heads up their ass, or simply choose to ignore it. It&#039;s the dumbing down of america.

Spying on untold masses is the easiest thanks to the exponential increase in computing power. The hardest is simply thinking and the grind of plain old-fashioned detective work and footwork.

				BTW... being that this thread is called &quot;Edward Snowden&quot;, I just now heard that he&#039;s about to receive some papers any minute to be able to leave the Moscow Airport and enter Russia while he waits the 3 months to find out if Russia approves his request for temporary assylum there...&nbsp; &nbsp;He said he wants to stay a while there and find a job &#039;cuz if he tries to fly to Latin America in the near future, chances are that the US will find a way to ground the plane he&#039;s on...&nbsp; so....&nbsp; &nbsp;hey, I hope he makes out O.K...&nbsp;

				Woohoo, Snowden! <br /><br />Heres the latest from Eddie - ( from *CLEARNET* http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden )<br /><br />The US government has paid at least £100m to the UK spy agency GCHQ over the last three years to secure access to and influence over Britain&#039;s intelligence gathering programmes.<br /><br />The top secret payments are set out in documents which make clear that the Americans expect a return on the investment, and that GCHQ has to work hard to meet their demands. &quot;GCHQ must pull its weight and be seen to pull its weight,&quot; a GCHQ strategy briefing said.<br /><br />The funding underlines the closeness of the relationship between GCHQ and its US equivalent, the National Security Agency. But it will raise fears about the hold Washington has over the UK&#039;s biggest and most important intelligence agency, and whether Britain&#039;s dependency on the NSA has become too great.<br /><br />In one revealing document from 2010, GCHQ acknowledged that the US had &quot;raised a number of issues with regards to meeting NSA&#039;s minimum expectations&quot;. It said GCHQ &quot;still remains short of the full NSA ask&quot;.<br /><br />Ministers have denied that GCHQ does the NSA&#039;s &quot;dirty work&quot;, but in the documents GCHQ describes Britain&#039;s surveillance laws and regulatory regime as a &quot;selling point&quot; for the Americans.<br /><br />The papers are the latest to emerge from the cache leaked by the American whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who has railed at the reach of the US and UK intelligence agencies.<br /><br />Snowden warned about the relationship between the NSA and GCHQ, saying the organisations have been jointly responsible for developing techniques that allow the mass harvesting and analysis of internet traffic. &quot;It&#039;s not just a US problem,&quot; he said. &quot;They are worse than the US.&quot;<br /><br />As well as the payments, the documents seen by the Guardian reveal:<br /><br />• GCHQ is pouring money into efforts to gather personal information from mobile phones and apps, and has said it wants to be able to &quot;exploit any phone, anywhere, any time&quot;.<br /><br />• Some GCHQ staff working on one sensitive programme expressed concern about &quot;the morality and ethics of their operational work, particularly given the level of deception involved&quot;.<br /><br />• The amount of personal data available to GCHQ from internet and mobile traffic has increased by 7,000% in the past five years – but 60% of all Britain&#039;s refined intelligence still appears to come from the NSA.<br /><br />• GCHQ blames China and Russia for the vast majority of cyber-attacks against the UK and is now working with the NSA to provide the British and US militaries with a cyberwarfare capability.<br /><br />The details of the NSA payments, and the influence the US has over Britain, are set out in GCHQ&#039;s annual &quot;investment portfolios&quot;. The papers show that the NSA gave GCHQ £22.9m in 2009. The following year the NSA&#039;s contribution increased to £39.9m, which included £4m to support GCHQ&#039;s work for Nato forces in Afghanistan, and £17.2m for the agency&#039;s Mastering the Internet project, which gathers and stores vast amounts of &quot;raw&quot; information ready for analysis.<br /><br />The NSA also paid £15.5m towards redevelopments at GCHQ&#039;s sister site in Bude, north Cornwall, which intercepts communications from the transatlantic cables that carry internet traffic. &quot;Securing external NSA funding for Bude has protected (GCHQ&#039;s core) budget,&quot; the paper said.<br /><br />In 2011/12 the NSA paid another £34.7m to GCHQ.<br /><br />The papers show the NSA pays half the costs of one of the UK&#039;s main eavesdropping capabilities in Cyprus. In turn, GCHQ has to take the American view into account when deciding what to prioritise.<br /><br />A document setting out GCHQ&#039;s spending plans for 2010/11 stated: &quot;The portfolio will spend money supplied by the NSA and UK government departments against agreed requirements.&quot;<br /><br />Other documents say the agency must ensure there has been &quot;an appropriate level of contribution … from the NSA perspective&quot;.<br /><br />The leaked papers reveal that the UK&#039;s biggest fear is that &quot;US perceptions of the … partnership diminish, leading to loss of access, and/or reduction in investment … to the UK&quot;.<br /><br />When GCHQ does supply the US with valuable intelligence, the agency boasts about it. In one review, GCHQ boasted that it had supplied &quot;unique contributions&quot; to the NSA during its investigation of the American citizen responsible for an attempted car bomb attack in Times Square, New York City, in 2010.<br /><br />No other detail is provided – but it raises the possibility that GCHQ might have been spying on an American living in the US. The NSA is prohibited from doing this by US law.<br /><br />Asked about the payments, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: &quot;In a 60-year alliance it is entirely unsurprising that there are joint projects in which resources and expertise are pooled, but the benefits flow in both directions.&quot;<br /><br />A senior security source in Whitehall added: &quot;The fact is there is a close intelligence relationship between the UK and US and a number of other countries including Australia and Canada. There&#039;s no automaticity, not everything is shared. A sentient human being takes decisions.&quot;<br /><br />Although the sums represent only a small percentage of the agencies&#039; budgets, the money has been an important source of income for GCHQ. The cash came during a period of cost-cutting at the agency that led to staff numbers being slashed from 6,485 in 2009 to 6,132 last year.<br /><br />GCHQ seems desperate to please its American benefactor and the NSA does not hold back when it fails to get what it wants. On one project, GCHQ feared if it failed to deliver it would &quot;diminish NSA&#039;s confidence in GCHQ&#039;s ability to meet minimum NSA requirements&quot;. Another document warned: &quot;The NSA ask is not static and retaining &#039;equability&#039; will remain a challenge for the near future.&quot;<br /><br />In November 2011, a senior GCHQ manager working in Cyprus bemoaned the lack of staff devoted to one eavesdropping programme, saying: &quot;This is not sustainable if numbers reduce further and reflects badly on our commitments to the NSA.&quot;<br /><br />The overriding necessity to keep on the right side of the US was revealed in a UK government paper that set out the views of GCHQ in the wake of the 2010 strategic defence and security review. The document was called: &quot;GCHQ&#039;s international alliances and partnerships: helping to maintain Britain&#039;s standing and influence in the world.&quot; It said: &quot;Our key partnership is with the US. We need to keep this relationship healthy. The relationship remains strong but is not sentimental. GCHQ must pull its weight and be seen to pull its weight.&quot;<br /><br />Astonishingly, the document admitted that 60% of the UK&#039;s high-value intelligence &quot;is based on either NSA end-product or derived from NSA collection&quot;. End product means official reports that are distillations of the best raw intelligence.<br /><br />Another pitch to keep the US happy involves reminding Washington that the UK is less regulated than the US. The British agency described this as one of its key &quot;selling points&quot;. This was made explicit two years ago when GCHQ set out its priorities for the coming years.<br /><br />&quot;We both accept and accommodate NSA&#039;s different way of working,&quot; the document said. &quot;We are less constrained by NSA&#039;s concerns about compliance.&quot;<br /><br />GCHQ said that by 2013 it hoped to have &quot;exploited to the full our unique selling points of geography, partnerships [and] the UK&#039;s legal regime&quot;.<br /><br />However, there are indications from within GCHQ that senior staff are not at ease with the rate and pace of change. The head of one of its programmes warned the agency was now receiving so much new intelligence that its &quot;mission management … is no longer fit for purpose&quot;.<br /><br />In June, the government announced that the &quot;single intelligence account&quot; fund that pays for GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 would be increased by 3.4% in 2015/16. This comes after three years in which the SIA has been cut from £1.92bn to £1.88bn. The agencies have also been told to make £220m savings on existing programmes.<br /><br />The parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) has questioned whether the agencies were making the claimed savings and said their budgets should be more rigorously scrutinised to ensure efficiencies were &quot;independently verifiable and/or sustainable&quot;.<br /><br />The Snowden documents show GCHQ has become increasingly reliant on money from &quot;external&quot; sources. In 2006 it received the vast majority of its funding directly from Whitehall, with only £14m from &quot;external&quot; funding. In 2010 that rose to £118m and by 2011/12 it had reached £151m. Most of this comes from the Home Office.

				Heard/read all that too, Wepromisewenty - so happy for Ed Snowden! ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;He WAS/IS responsible when letting the people know what everyone has the right to know about who else is reading/listening to what they are saying privately to the person(s) they communicate with.&nbsp; The NSA &amp; other related government agencies have NO right to be reading/listening to anything not addressed to them and it was making me sick how all the stories - especially mainstream were like deliberately ignoring the proverbial &quot;elephant in the room&quot; and trying to make it all about Snowden and whether or not he&#039;s a hero or traitor (the answer to that imo has always been obvious - HERO!)<br /><br />Anyway, I really do hope that he will stay safe.&nbsp; Am sure he is very aware that he needs to be careful - US alphabet soup types are crawling all over the globe anyway, and surely are in great numbers in Russia right now.&nbsp; At the same time, should he be hit by a drone strike or even an assassin, surely suspicion will be put immediately on Obama and he&#039;s already looking pretty bad in the eyes of a lot of people..&nbsp; hopefully he knows better than to go on the attack..&nbsp; &nbsp;although I must admit, the thought of how pissed he must be really be at having not gotten his way and especially that is is so publicly known.. is at the least, amusing.&nbsp; And that bitch Diane Feinstein must be just livid!&nbsp; Good to see karma in action.&nbsp; Snowden got his assylum, those who knowingly ignored the constitution and set up the huge spying operation and tried to keep it secret got caught, are totally embarrassed (and rightfully so) can&#039;t do a damn thing about it..&nbsp; ha ha!<br /><br />Never been much of a fan of Putin, but might be starting to like him a bit more..&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Stay Safe Edward Snowen!&nbsp; You are truly courageous and a real Hero to so many!!! ;D

				Snowden is 80% hero. Not only has he blown the whistle on the NSA and exposed DC&#039;s overreach, he&#039;s also had the balls to tell the world who he is and why he&#039;s doing what he&#039;s doing. He didn&#039;t try to dump what he knows anonymously and hope not to get caught. He identified himself and explained his honourable motives. He&#039;s on a martyr&#039;s path, not that of a criminal.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Compare to Assange...hrm, bit of a blowhard. He&#039;s a middleman. A smart middleman, sure. But he&#039;d be nothing without people like Snowden (even though it could be argued that the precedent Assange set made the Snowden revolution possible) and Bradley Manning. Not that Manning&#039;s a greatly important or admirable character. If he actually leaked something more than a whole lot of juicy diplomatic gossip which is ultimately of little consequence I might have a bit more respect for him. And of course he only started banging the liberty drum once he was caught. Kind of undermines your credibility a bit, Brad.<br /><br />All in all, when it comes to gravitas, Snowden is The Economist while Manning is the National Enquirer.<br /><br />There is a black mark on Snowden, though - why did he shop the US out to China? Yes I know the US does some bad shit, but sometimes you got to take sides and I&#039;ll tell you what - the Chinese will do whatever it takes. They are at an economic and technical disadvantage to the US when it comes to intelligence gathering, but they don&#039;t want to catch up - they want to surpass. They&#039;ll do whatever it takes.&nbsp; Personally, if the NSA, CIA and their allied intelligence services WEREN&#039;T hacking the shit out of the Chinese government&#039;s networks and their proxies and finding out exactly what those guys are up to, then they should all lose their jobs. That&#039;s the kind of shit they need to be focussing on, not listening to mobile phone conversations between two German housewives.<br /><br />And now Snowden&#039;s in Russia. Initially I thought it was a disaster for the US - I&#039;m sure Snowden will have to have every piece of intelligence he holds to the FSB, if they haven&#039;t already taken it. What a disaster if Snowden gave the Russians a tranche of top secret information. <br /><br />Then again, maybe it&#039;s not so bad. It isn&#039;t in Russia&#039;s interests to tell the rest of the world what they&#039;ve learnt from Snowden. The Americans don&#039;t yet know exactly what Snowden&#039;s got up his sleeve. If the Russians show their hand, the Americans can change strategy and the Russians will lose their advantage. But if the Americans don&#039;t know what the Russians know, they won&#039;t know where to look.&nbsp; If Snowden has provided intelligence to the Russians, it would be very much in the Russian interest to keep what they know to themselves.<br /><br />Putin: he&#039;s perhaps the world&#039;s richest man (see what you can find out about an oil broking firm based in Switzerland called Gunvor) in a country that&#039;s going to be utterly fucked by the end of this century. <br /><br />Let&#039;s consider China and Russia. Do they have admirable political systems? Good god no. They are truly fucked, hideous. The ruling elite in those countries create despair.<br /><br />What about the US? It&#039;s a nice idea that worked for a time but some wankers fucked with the formula and now it&#039;s disappointing. <br /><br />But in disappointment we have the possibility of something better, because the formula&#039;s still there. The tree of liberty hasn&#039;t been watered enough recently, and consequently we have people like Barack W Obusha, and the Republic&#039;s a pale imitation of what it should be. But that tree of liberty&#039;s a tough plant and it can wait for water.<br /><br />&nbsp;You can&#039;t say that for Russia or China.&nbsp; Despair.

They don&#039;t co-operate with the Americans at every turn because they have their own agenda, which I suspect you wouldn&#039;t be a big fan of.<br /><br />Consider the following.<br /><br />You observe Party A attempting to rape Party B. Suddenly, Party C steps in and prevents Party A from raping Party B. <br /><br />You applaud Party C, because it looks as though Party C acted to stop Party A because they objected to the violation of Party B.<br /><br />But what if Party C acted to stop Party A because they wanted to rape Party B instead? And probably do some more stuff besides. Maybe I&#039;m cynical, but this is Putin&#039;s Russia, unfortunately. <br /><br />Lesser of two evils? The US is less evil.

Nothing, i think hes a fake, as iv said.<br />Its good because we have a comparison in this case, snowden knows this too, thats why he released his to a major broad sheet and manning to a whistle blowing web site, the difference is that manning is sat in a high security cell and most likely will be for the rest of his life and snowden gave interviews from a luxury hotel room. <br />If he wanted to change things, show the world the truth he would have stuck to his guns and released all, just like manning did, follow it through or don&#039;t bother starting it, as it stands all he has told us is that the NSA are undertaking a massive surveillance operation that is in place across the globe incorporating many security agencies, something most of us had a hunch they were up to in the first place. <br />So, whats the situation with prism now? Well its still in operation and now we all know about it....have you got outraged? have you written to your senator about your concerns? I don&#039;t know, i hope so but the more you look at this the more its looking like some fantastic publicity stunt to reveal the existence of a constitutional breaking surveillance program that now every knows about but don&#039;t appear to be doing much about.
