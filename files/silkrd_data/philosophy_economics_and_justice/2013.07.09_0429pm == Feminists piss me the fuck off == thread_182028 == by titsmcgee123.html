				Well.. the only thing that annoys me about them is this.<br />When a man hits a woman, even if she was assaulting him, feminist groups go into uprage all over the world and jump on the bandwagon about how he should be locked up etc, however then they shout that they want equality and womans rights. If women and men are the same, should it not matter if a man hits another man or a woman? Well, shock to the system, there actually are differences, whether it be physical or mental, there are differences and they just dont want to admit it.Its fact end of.<br /><br />Men and women are different end of story. The fact is that feminists have gone too far. They have started a whole thing about wman now when everything is already equal, Youl also find the majority of them are those vegan hippies you see everywhere....

				HAH! good one.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let them piss you off mate, listen, debate, argue.<br /><br />Some i&#039;ve met just clearly wanted something more than others.&nbsp; Most of the time they&#039;re not so confident in respect to men and only want something for themselves and not as much for others.<br /><br />Some however have something real to say and are doing the right thing.<br /><br />Like with every other social situation, distinguish the opportunists from the righteous. (bit of a strong word?)<br /><br /><br />However, you may not realize it if you&#039;re not a total douche, but a LOT of women do not feel at ease mainly because of men (and they&#039;re not all feminists).&nbsp; The situation should not be ignored and everyone should have their say.<br />If you&#039;re not comfortable with your girlfriend walking home alone at night, fearing for her safety, that&#039;s exactly the problem.

I want to be able to look after her. I am the jealous type but not the controlling asshole type. I dont like those types of douches, But i do feel like I need to look out for her and that she WOULD need my help if shit were to go down, I also dont think i would be able to live with myself if it did.<br />When she works, i cant sleep until she is home anyway, However&nbsp; i know women that are the same about their husbands who work late.<br /><br />its a sort of strange topic

				Thanks HeatFireFlame.<br /><br />As for hitting women when they go psycho is actually a personal dilemma of mine.<br />My current girlfriend thinks it&#039;s ok to slap me on the head now and then.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I deserve it, at least not most of the time.<br /><br />Actually she&#039;s a bitch so there&#039;s not much debate there.<br /><br /><br />An interesting example of some annoying feminists are those who responded to the &quot;Blachman Show&quot; on Danish television.<br />Basically Blachman is Danish jazz musician and now hosts a show where he invites a celebrity to observe a naked woman.&nbsp; They look for women of all ages from 18 to 100 to come on the plateau in a robe and take it off so they can start commenting her.&nbsp; I think they are attempting to evoke the poetry of the female body.<br /><br />Unfortunately Blachman also puts forth the proposition that a female body is thirsting for a man&#039;s words.&nbsp; It seems a little presumptuous, but I doubt he believes that is all that women thirst for.&nbsp; He does say the &quot;female body&quot; and not the &quot;female&quot; as a whole.<br /><br />Therefore feminists are in outrage, some do not even bother to translate what is said and assume they are saying &quot;nasty things&quot;.<br /><br />Clearnet link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VABxnDXoYQ4

Feminists seem to have this impression that everyone else is out to get them and &quot;all&quot; men are whatever. They categorize men more than we categorize women.<br /><br />As for your girlfriend slapping you etc, i have been hit of my girlfriend a few times, however its not like its the worst they do it because you can stand there and take it, if you were to turn round and hit her back she would most likely fall, and probably never hit you again yet it isnt right to do so because men are superior physically. It is a fact so it isnt a manly thing to do to hit a woman.However this does not give her an excuse to hit you because she knows you wont hit her back, this is taking advantage. <br />And if she hits you and looks like she will continually hit you or do it again, just grab her and hold her down on the ground. This will stop her doing it, your not hitting her, your well within your rights and it will piss her the fuck off, trust me, thats what i do, or used to do. Dont need to anymore.<br /><br />Women love positive comments from men. same as men love positive comments from women, so bloody what? its nature. No need to be feminists etc. <br /><br />Hff

				Some threatened males in this thread.<br /><br />Feminism is completely right. Feminism is about seeking equality in society, education, and the work-place; and about giving women control over their own fertility. It is also about recognizing the overwhelming majority of inter-gender violence, is male on female. Not all, but the overwhelming majority.<br /><br />Yes, there are some counter-productive feminists, especially the radials. But the radicals of any ilk contain the most mental of any ilk. Like white people. White radicals - racial activists - are repellent idiots, but it would be a shame to write off the entire white races (or races) because of them. Same with feminism. That there are some very loud and very wrong feminists does not make feminism itself wrong, just them.<br /><br />Or junkies who overdose, leave their needles about, thieve or cause violence for their drugs, etc.... do you think it is fair your drug use is judged because of their destructive behaviors?<br />
