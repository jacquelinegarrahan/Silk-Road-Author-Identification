				These are going to be Clear net links so don&#039;t use TOR to go there and further more don&#039;t be on TOR when browsing with your regular browser.<br /><br />I got my philosophy from these 2 sources and they make more sense to me then any bibles I have read and I think I have read them all along with all the history of their writings.<br /><br />http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/index.htm&nbsp; <br />with how I have experienced my life The Kybalion makes more sense to me.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6OkPiU5YqA&amp;list=PL4D5D24FF3C9AB532<br />These videos with Napoleon Hill are amazing and if you can look past the low standard of technology in those days and if you can understand the message then it is clear that the man was on to something. He came up with his publications during the 1930&#039;s depression era in an attempt to help Americans drag themselves out of a bad time. To me it&#039;s a work of genius. Look at the video about cosmic habit force. This one taught me how to change my habitual way of thinking that would change my paradigm and it has been working great. ASt first it&#039;s hard and I had to write on a peice of paper every morning so that when I woke up I would remember to start each day out with giving thanks and it sets the tone for the day to go good. After a couple of weeks this became a habit and I no longer had to put in any effort to do it. That&#039;s when the changes became evident on a daily basis. They start out as little evidences. For anyone that wants to see their life change for the better then go give this mans philosophy an honest try. Watch all the vids one after another. Take him up on his challenge and see for yourself that it works.<br /><br />Also look closely at all these vids and follow his philosophy it will not fail you I promise<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />He must have been a Freemason for it was the Knights Templar who kept the secrets hidden from the world so they could control the world with their man made belief system. The Freemasons, Knights Templar, and Rose Croix were all the same organization with the Illuminati trying to say that they were devil worshipers. NOT TRUE in my opinion. I believe they really were the protectors of the secrets of the universe and would not let just anyone know about it because of there own sense of wanting to save the world from itself at first then corruption took hold when they realized the power they possessed with it. It was wrong to keep this hidden from the world but it was meant to be like that. You see, people have got to evolve and be ready to except such info. If you read The Kybalion it plainly states that it doesn&#039;t ask for followers or for it&#039;s writtings to be made into a &quot;creed&quot; or bible. It states that &quot;the lips of wisdom are open only to the ears of understanding&quot; Now you may read it and think &quot;what a bunch of shit&quot; but I was able to read it and understand it. At first it left me feeling strange and scared. It takes me about 4 hours to read the whole thing. I&#039;ve red it a lot. There&#039;s movies that narrate it word for word. I&#039;ve slept with it playing.<br /><br />I&#039; graduated High School with ease and went to Tech school and got certified and went on to college and had to drop out because of financial situations so I am a fairly educated person. My point is that after a person does so much reading in their life then certain works become noticeable and when history is researched thoroughly then a pattern begins to show itself. <br /><br />I have no doubt that these 2 paths of info is where they got their research for the movie &quot;The Secret&quot;.<br /><br />Oh yea when I started researching 3 years ago I ran into that also but I found holes in that one as well and so my search continued until I found these sources. They work for me.<br /><br />If you have any questions then feel free to reply with it here because I rarely use HeeHaw anymore<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				... so being grateful for what you have instead of coveting what you don&#039;t have and simmering in bitter resentment makes one&#039;s day more pleasant.&nbsp; By God, it&#039;s a bonified cosmic phenomenon -- we must put theory to this mysticism...!!<br /><br /><br />Gimme a break man.&nbsp; Some things work well, and some things don&#039;t.&nbsp; Doesn&#039;t mean the universe gives a fuck either way.<br />

				it doesn&#039;t give a fuck.<br /><br />I feel that God exist but that&#039;s it. The earth and universe are here for us to use with our abilities and we get no help from a deity. We be and that&#039;s all God done. We have more abilities then people can phanthom at this stage in our evilution but trust me when I say that each one of us is in control of our own world. I don&#039;t thank God when I give thanks. I just have thoughts and feelings of thankful ness for things like my health. Your body is created brand new every 2 or three years and your mind has an influence on the cells that are generated new every day. <br /><br />The churches have exploited this to make people believe that their religion works when it is just the art of being tahnkful and feeling thought of gratitude with in your heart that works. Not to a God. I will never push religion. I&#039;d rather push Marijuana. It&#039;s really from the creator. You want to be an athiest then go ahead it&#039;s your freedom. I will fight for your freedoms even if I don&#039;t agree with it. I don&#039;t follow any cults or religions. <br /><br />Water is something special and I do all my &quot;being thankful&quot; during my morning Showers. My philosophy is something That I came up with myself after living for almost 50 years and experiencing life SS but if you want to come over and smoke a bowl or vape a rock then I&#039;d love to with you

				Sorry man, I apparently jumped to conclusions thinking you were -- well, that you were saying something you apparently weren&#039;t.&nbsp; I agree, being grateful is a very effective way to maintain perspective.&nbsp; I&#039;ve even seen studies that say so.<br /><br />Interestingly, depressed people are much more likely to have a realistic view of the world and their prospects.&nbsp; The ones who are delusional and let themselves think they&#039;ll win the lottery someday or something like that tend to rate their life with much high satisfaction levels when asked (really bad example, but you hopefully see what I mean).&nbsp; In my opinion, &quot;the secret,&quot; is that it isn&#039;t just their happiness and outlook that changes.&nbsp; Their expectations for what will happen changes.<br /><br />The people who expect good things to happen and sincerely believe that they can make them happen are much, much more likely to accomplish their goals.&nbsp; There is power in believing you can change the world.&nbsp; Even if you can&#039;t, just believing you can makes it much more likely that you ever will.&nbsp; Most people don&#039;t seem to realize that.

				God is not here and has never been here but we have always had dogs and they teach us love.<br />The secret as promoted by whatever business thief got its greedy mitts on it is an over simplified version of a reality that can be and is for those who actively, conciously diligently train there minds.<br />The many Buddhist sects around the world have been on it for ever. As we live in the modern world&nbsp; brain patterns have been observed and the researchers are gob smacked with what they see. The Dalai Lama is regularly invited to the various&nbsp; conferences that the world leaders in quantum physics hold. <br />A researcher recently dealt with a person who suffers phantom pain due to an amputation, he had them stand in front of a mirror and due exercises, due to reflective crossover, whzat the patient was seeing was there amputated limb exercising and this info has been processed by the brain new pathways have been grown to accommodate. End result for patient way less pain. the result for humanity if allowed would be profound.<br />With the correct brain training and diet etc you could constantly be healing and preventing disease and so much more.<br />That being said, if a really positive christian that has faith [ short circuited brain or scammer ]&nbsp; comes to your door on a sunday, well sometimes its good to put positive thought into action. Whistle up ya god/ dog and get him to chase that evil fucker away.
