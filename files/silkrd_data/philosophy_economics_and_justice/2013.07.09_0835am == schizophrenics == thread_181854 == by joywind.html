				schizophrenia is largely misunderstood as split personality disorder. The two are actually different.

				I found a statistic that 25% of schizophrenics recover entirely after a single episode, 25% have chronic schizophrenia with no remission, and 50% have schizophrenic episodes mixed with periods of remission. I think schizophrenia is best described as an episodic or chronic disorder, depending on the particular case, but it definitely does not appear to be a progressive illness, other than perhaps from the onset to the peak of an individual episode, or from onset to symptomatic in chronic schizophrenics (but not progressive through the course of life of those afflicted by it).

				I think the study you linked to confused correlation with causation, as the more recent study I linked to claimed that the reduced volume of brain tissue was caused by secondary factors, such as the use of anti psychotic drugs, and was not directly caused by schizophrenia.

				Actually it looks like both of those studies came out very closely to each other, so the one I linked to must have been referencing another set of studies. I suppose the only conclusion we can come to is that the evidence to determine in either way is inconclusive, with some researchers arguing that schizophrenia progressively leads to brain deterioration and others saying that it very rarely does and that studies showing otherwise are not taking into account secondary causes such as exposure to anti psychotics.

You were able to tell that you were in what you call &quot;hell&quot; or psychosis. Real psychotic behavior, however, is not understood by the one having it, if not, in fact, in the remission lapses. When you are in a real psychosis you cannot understand that you are behaving psychotically atm. If you can understand it when you are having the psychotic episode, then it&#039;s not real psychosis. As an example it happens to a lot of people to have an anxiety attack in where you think you are going insane. If you can think that you are going insane, you aren&#039;t really going insane, it is just the anxiety that makes you behave like you think so.<br /><br />Schizophrenic people are not suffering at the moment of psychosis (or better: they naturally can suffer depending on what they are feeling/experiencing, but the suffering is not caused by the comparison between &quot;reality&quot; and &quot;psychosis&quot; and the difference in the two as in your case) because they feel they are perfectly &quot;normal&quot; and what they experience as perfectly real and the true state of things. In your described experiences you could feel sorry when you were in that state because you could understand it as unnatural in comparison to what you can consider a &quot;normal&quot; state of mind. For schizophrenics (and real psychotic episodes) this doesn&#039;t happen, so how can they feel &quot;bad&quot; for what&#039;s happening?<br /><br />Apart this, then, psychosis is a very ample subject, probably too ample to be able to approach it correctly in a forum. I personally think that the only real &quot;bad&quot; thing of schizophrenia and psychosis is that you cannot make order in the chaos and work practically within that new framework (as you can do in the &quot;normal&quot; one that all people experience); if you could, then that state would not be absolutely &quot;bad&quot;, it would be just a different framework, and it would just depend on the framework itself if it is bad to be there or not (as in, for example, having voices telling you to harm yourself then it obviously is not so good to experience this as real, but in the case you instead will hear a voice that would instead help you then it would not be absolutely a bad thing, just the contrary; btw, Socrates heard &quot;voices&quot; too, he called the voice his Augoeides or &quot;Genius&quot;). <br /><br />I have a very close friend with schizophrenia and when she had the psychotic moments amidst the chaos there were many many times where she actually had a vision of things that were, IMO, much better than the &quot;normal&quot; approach to things of &quot;normal&quot; people. It is only that she could not work practically with that vision, she was just a slave of it. If she could learn to make order in the chaos and work practically in that framework, she would not have been in a worse position than &quot;normal&quot;, actually the contrary. Btw many of the things and states that psychotic pass true are passed upon practicing Magick or Mysticism (or even shamanism or sorcery); it is only that in this last case, as I said before, you are a master there and you can make order in the chaos instead of being a slave of what&#039;s happening, but many of the &quot;effects&quot; are not so different (case in point: hearing &quot;voices&quot; or similar things).

Cancer is an example of a progressive disease. The tumor continues to grow and spread and the cancer gets progressively worse over the course of the disease, unless it is cured. Neurodegeneration leading to behavioral changes can be discrete or continuous. In the case of a stroke it is discrete, the damage is done to the brain and then no further degeneration occurs, in other words there is no progression of neurodegeneration after the stroke and related issues are dealt with. In the case of schizophrenia, having neurodegeneration after an initial episode is not enough to make it a progressive disease, just as having neurodegeneration after a stroke is not enough to make it a progressive disease. In order for it to be a progressive disease, the amount of neurodegeneration would need to increase in a continuous fashion over time. Initial degeneration prior to any secondary causes being a possibility (ie: prior to the administration of anti-psychotic drugs) does rule out secondary causes and gives strong supporting evidence that schizophrenia leads to initial neurodegeneration, but if the volume of brain tissue stabilizes after the initial decrease it doesn&#039;t make sense to me to call it a progressive disease.

				I&#039;m not sure that neurodegeneration after a stroke could be described as discrete? It&#039;s generally a hugely traumatic event, that has long term flow on effects that results in secondary damage occurring well beyond the loci. That aside, you seem to be saying that schizophrenia causes neurodegeneration, when I thought we&#039;d already agreed schizophrenia is an ambiguous term for a very misunderstood condition. So, on what evidence does &quot;schizophrenia&quot; cause neurodegeneration, rather than neurodegeneration cause schizophrenia. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;If the neurodegeneration had occurred during development of the brain, ceased and remained latent until first episode then it would not be progressive. That does not appear to be the case. After the brain has finished developing neurodegeneration occurs, after neurodegeneration occurs behavioural changes occur, this is progressive. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I raised this point in response to your point on first episode schizophrenics &amp; your assertion that anti-psychs are a potential cause of neurodegeneration. I never indicated I thought neurodegeneration ceased after first episode. To the contrary, that article I cited is primarily a meta analysis of imaging studies performed on long term schizophrenics which demonstrated statistically significant results in favour of progressive neurodegeneration.

I have always thought that a progressive disorder is one that becomes increasingly worse as time passes. By your definition a heart attack is a progressive disorder, because after cardiodegeneration occurs behavioral changes occur. I would not consider a heart attack to be a progressive disorder but rather an acute disorder that can indeed progress to death. I think by your definition everything must be considered a progressive disorder if it doesn&#039;t take place in a planck unit of time. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, I raised this point in response to your point on first episode schizophrenics &amp; your assertion that anti-psychs are a potential cause of neurodegeneration. I never indicated I thought neurodegeneration ceased after first episode. To the contrary, that article I cited is primarily a meta analysis of imaging studies performed on long term schizophrenics which demonstrated statistically significant results in favour of progressive neurodegeneration.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Originally I posted a link to a study claiming that the lessening of brain tissue associated with schizophrenia is caused by secondary causes and is merely correlative with schizophrenia. You countered this by saying that after an initial episode and prior to the administration of antipsychotic drugs, there is detectable lessening of brain tissue volume. I then took the position that perhaps the onset of schizophrenia is associated with a decrease in brain tissue, but that subsequent decreases in brain tissue are caused by secondary causes such as the administration of antipscyhotics , as the research I linked to claimed. If schizophrenia causes acute neurodegeneration, but not chronic neurodegeneration over time, then it is not a progressive disease as far as my understanding of progressive diseases go.

Zipursky, M.D.<br />Professor and Chair<br />Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences<br />McMaster University<br /><br />Clinicians generally think of Schizophrenia as a progressive illness, beginning early in life with psychotic episodes in adolescence and the early twenties, and resulting in a state of disability. Yet these assumptions may be incorrect. Reasons for the assumption that Schizophrenia is a progressive disease may include the â€˜clinicianâ€™s illusionâ€™, which is the attribution of the characteristic and course of those patients who are currently ill to the entire population contracting the illness. Another component that may contribute to the assumption of progression is Berksonâ€™s fallacy, the idea that those who have other disabilities that are not causally connected to the condition being investigated are more likely to enter the formal treatment system, and that these etiologically unrelated conditions may have a negative influence on the course of the illness. A longitudinal study found that the best predictor for a long-term successful outcome is the patientâ€™s treatment success in the first two years of the illness. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the percentage of those doing poorly increases over time. Conclusions emphasized the following: there is little evidence that there is substantial progression of the disease, most remitted patients remain well with going treatment, short-term course predicts long-term outcome, the percentage of patients with a poor outcome remains stable over time, and many patients can be symptom free and obtain employment. The reasons why patients do poorly can be due to premorbid deficits, concurrent disorders, extended period of the disability before treatment, limited access to necessary interventions, non-adherence with resulting relapses, and a downhill spiral due to stigma, poverty, homelessness, and unemployment. Clinicians must work hard to intervene in ways that are known to be effective.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Schizophrenia is a made up word to encompass a very broad range of mental disorders. If you ask 10 psychiatrists what it means, you&#039;ll get 10 different answers, if any answers at all. It&#039;s not treatable through conventional western medicine, although the pharma industry would like people to believe that so they can cash in. It is also the most inhumane field in medicine where the patients have no rights and&nbsp; abuse both mental and physical is rife (far worse than Gitmo).

				I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia.<br /><br />My symptoms are very similar to schizophrenia&#039;s definition on wikipedia. I often have slurred speech or mix words in sentences. And I&#039;ve always experienced auditory hallucinations(mainly whistling) and didn&#039;t tell anyone until a few months ago. I started seeing things while operating a forklift which is why I sought help.<br /><br />I used to be severely depressed but I am now on Quetiapine which stops my suicidal thoughts. Hasn&#039;t been long enough to know if the hallucinations are gone though(only been two weeks.)<br /><br />I always knew I was screwed up because I never laugh. And I stay as cool as a cucumber when everyone else is loosing their shit.<br /><br />Oh and painkillers don&#039;t work for me. Ecstasy does not give me a body high, and I&#039;ve had 7g of mushroom and not feel much while my friends are rolling on their faces on 3.5g of the same. This is while following all rules(no tolerance due to other drugs, no diary, empty stomach, take with vitamin c etc.)<br /><br />EDIT: I also get lots of pleasure from blunt force. If I get into a fight or just stub my toe I always come out with an erection. My wiring is very screwed up.

				My buddy is schizophrenic, but as long as he takes his meds he is cool.<br /><br />When he does not take the meds, he loses the plot a little and can knock at anyones door asking strange questions.<br /><br />Lucky its a small village so nobody is put out much.<br /><br />I think we need to differentiate between schizophrenia and the many other forms of mental conditions.<br /><br />Depression for example is the main No 1 mental issue as reported by the doctors. <br /><br />Thing is no mental condition out there inhibits your ability to be intelligent. <br /><br />If you have some mental condition that is a burden sometimes, think of the positive. Many intelligent people will suffer with some mental health condition/issue. <br /><br />Schizophrenics should always take their medication and if young, you need to try out different meds at different doses and trust me, you WILL get better. We need to be careful that those suffering schizophrenia don&#039;t stop using meds. Its amazing how research is coming on. Its a terrible condition IF you have no support or if you do not know what is actually happening to you.<br /><br />Simple fault in the brain that one day will be cured, with ease, by some simple procedure.

				To the OP, I was recently told by a medical professional that, contrary to traditional thinking, schizophrenia is not chronic but can be cured entirely.<br />One thing a lot of people don&#039;t understand are the so-called &#039;negative symptoms&#039; (depression, lack of speech, apathy, and so on) which are often harder to treat than the &#039;positive symptoms&#039; (voices, delusions). Anti-depressants are often used in conjunction with anti-psychotics for this reason.
