				Can the guy who got arrested for the ricin letter sue for false imprisonment?<br />We studied this law case in class last week called Ferrel vs Mikula <br />if you google it theres more info but ill give you the short story<br />basically these&nbsp; 2 girls got arrested bec as they were leaving the resteraunt (somebody left without paying) someone pointed out their car to the cops instead of the suspects car <br />cops pulled them over and put them in handcuffs and detained them on the side of the road for 20 mins, and then let them go back to their car and drive off after they realized they had the wrong person<br />they went to court and sued the resteraunt a couple other defendants.<br />courts ruled in favor of defendants and case was dropped so they appealed<br />Appellate courts reversed the decision and said that they can be held liable for false imprisonment even if they had probable cause! Furthermore Ferrell can hold them liable for false imprisonment even though it wasnt malicious

				He can try to sue for a multitude of things but ultimately it will all depend upon how much money this guy has available to spend and how good of a lawyer he gets. Some things I could imagine he could sue over is false imprisonment, reputation tarnishment, drawing unwanted media attention, loss of wages because it will make it harder for him to get employed, etc.. In the US, you can sue for anything you can think of pretty much. Do I think he is going to? Maybe. But it would most certainly be something small settled out of court.
