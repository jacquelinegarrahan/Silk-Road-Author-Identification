				I would claim not to have known what they were, and since you have no other naughties on your record, you may be OK, especially as you never opened them. Keep your fingers crossed (never hurts). I really don&#039;t know what the pigs think about those types of compounds - perhaps they will test as speed, as the 2C compounds are all amphetamine-derivatives.

				did you get arrested and the cops took the 2c-e as evidence or was the 2c-e taken as by the hospital to see what you &quot;overdosed&quot; on or whatever they think happened to you so they would know how to treat you? 2C-e was scheduled as a Schedule 1 drug in the United States this past year (along with Mephedrone, MPDV, 2-CI, and 2c-P), So I assume they know what it is in a lab and what to test for. Were you charged with anything or was it just confiscated by the cops?

				pm theadvocate if you can find her...<br /><br />Hopefully you kept your mouth shut.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t know why, youtube &quot;why you should never talk to the police.&quot;&nbsp; First offence, small amounts are circumstances in your favour.&nbsp; Hopefully you didn&#039;t say fuck all to the cops about anything. Theadvocate is a lawyer on here and s/he&#039;s has a good presence on here.&nbsp; Hopefully you didn&#039;t say one word to the police.&nbsp; Good luck.

				I dont understand were you arrested and you are being charged with controlled substance (and they are lab testing to find out which one)&nbsp; ??<br />Then you are probably screwed, but a good lawyer will get you off with simple probation<br />Did they just confiscate the said drugs and not charge you with anything?<br />then you are fine, you have nothing to worry about, Theyre not gonna come busting down your door to arrest you over a personal amt they confiscated from you previously

I&#039;ve never heard of that, but where I&#039;m from (i live in a major city), if the cops find weed, they will usually just take it and grind it into the pavement with their shoes and let you go. If its pills, they usually just take the pills and either let you go or arrest you on the spot.<br />The one time that I got arrested, I was in NYC. The cop who pulled me over said i looked kinda high and searched my car for like 15-20 mins. He kept finding stuff that he claimed were paraphenlia (like sealed straws from mcdonalds, a metal spoon that i used for my otameal) and got real frustrated that he couldnt find any drugs or real paraphanelia. Finally he pops open my trunk and after searching for awhile he finds my GF&#039;s pregnancy test box and finds two opanas inside. So I get arrested, but they just gave me a desk appearence ticket at the precienct and let me go. When i came to court with my lawyer, i find out the case was dropped due to &quot;overcrowding&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Well in this case I would assume it&#039;s pretty likely since he said they were lab testing it. They need some revenue to cover that. So I&#039;m pretty sure in most all instances like OP&#039;s you&#039;ll catch a case. I would guess he was cited for whatever it is they knew they found, so he&#039;s already got a case, then they just add charges. Anyway I haven&#039;t something this specific happen but I have had them change/adjust/add charges on to my cases before, seems pretty standard.<br /><br />Anyway yeah, big city they will have less time for shit like that, but felony charges means thousands are getting tossed around, it&#039;s just good for business and the officers numbers.

				i have no charge. i have nothing right now. i have a reference # and i was just told shit was sent to the lab, but im sure once they are finished fucking with it there wont be more than 10mg (from 25mg) 2c-e left. not even enough to be effective. Also both the 2c-e and 2c-p bags were NEVER opened. I could careless about the pot. it would my first pot charge. and no one gave them permission to search. i have a full time job, own my own car and live very healthily...<br /><br />we will see..

				Hm that sucks. I know where I&#039;m at they have a pretty long time before they have to actually file charges, so they can dick around and come get you if they feel like it. I&#039;d look into how long that is just so you know for sure.
