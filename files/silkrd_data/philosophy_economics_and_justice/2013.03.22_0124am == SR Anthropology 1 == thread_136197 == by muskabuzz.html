				wondering if our friends here noticed anything interesting in the waves of people constantly becoming Silk Road<br />especially their assimilation/the community&#039;s assimilation of their own traits <br />evolution of SR and greater agorist civilization<br /><br />we know this is not the place for noob hate nor sentimentality but rather to contemplate the reality of an unprecedented community and appreciating a live moment in history we share.<br /><br />thank you SR philosophers<br /><br />Muskabuzz<br />

				I find it harder and harder as time goes by to recognize the nyms of those I came to know in the early days. Many of them I can&#039;t even recognize in the sea of posting, and I assume many people don&#039;t remember the conversations we have had. With influx after influx, of new users (and I am not saying that is a bad thing) it is hard to hold on to the past here in the public view. I read a lot of the posts I find interesting, and comment here and there, but I am nowhere near as active here as I once was. I like the idea of the newb section (not because I don&#039;t think they belong on the main board, but because I think the basics should be asked and answered there instead of &quot;race to 50&quot; threads) I would also like to see a veterans section (not vendor roundtable) but a section for those of us who have been weathered by the past couple years of expansion. It is easy enough to keep that in private forums, but what that has is &quot;family&quot; feel, it lacks in being public with new members and ideas entering the circle. I&#039;m not talking a section to be voted into, but one that doesn&#039;t have &quot;how does I pgp&quot; and &quot;where is bitcoins from&quot; threads. where we can just chat. I like to chat. I like off topic discussion. All of the people who I would consider my best friends are from this online scene, and it&#039;s just too bad they are not all in one place.<br /><br />sorry about the wretched ramble, it is becoming more common as higher doses of 2C-B become regular.<br /><br />shameless plug on envious&#039; 2C-B...It&#039;s great stuff and priced right...tell him wretched sent ya and maybe I&#039;ll get a commission, lol

				It sounds very much like a small town where everyone knew each other has turned into a dynamic city.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				That sort of describes it. some of us have moved into the suburbs, but travel to the city regularly to see what&#039;s new :)
