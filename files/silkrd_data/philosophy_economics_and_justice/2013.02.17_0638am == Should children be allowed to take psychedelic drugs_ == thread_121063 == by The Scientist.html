				Among the Mazatec Indians, it is common for children to eat psilocybin mushrooms with their parents. (see &quot;Hallucinogens and Shamanism&quot;, edited by Michael J. Harner, p. 86.)<br /><br />Timothy Leary said that psychedelic drugs will revolutionise our procedures of child rearing and education. <br /><br />&quot;Through the use of these chemical keys to the nervous system as regular tools of learning, you will be asking your children, when they come home from school, not &#039;What book are you reading?&#039; but &#039;Which molecules are you using to open up new Libraries of Congress inside your nervous system?&#039; Chemicals will be the central method of education in the future.&quot;<br /><br />What do you think? With proper supervision, should children be allowed to take psychedelic drugs? Could they play a role in education? Would children benefit from having a spiritual psychedelic experience?

				IMHO, it would be a bad idea for kids to take psychedelic drugs. Their brains aren&#039;t fully developed and I would have thought that psychedelic drugs could hamper their development. I&#039;m not an expert, so just expressing my opinion :)

				Agree 100% with what people have said. No mind altering chemicals (unless it is a serious medical issue, and no i dont mean &quot;Timmy wont listen to me and doest what he wants, he needs ritalin&quot; BS) should be introduced into a developing brain. Once the brain is developed, there is almost zero risk of permanent damage to the wiring and chemical balance of the brain....AS LONG AS they are used in very disciplined and spaced out sessions. Most people dont do that part, myself included, but still, if you choose to take that path of having regularly, wait for the brain to fully develope.<br /><br />S

				when you look at the use of psychedelics in societies where it&#039;s accepted/used in social context (such as african tribes), <br />you&#039;ll note that the earliest use of psychedelic isn&#039;t given during the childhood but during the ritual that marks the passing from childhood into adulthood,<br />since there is no knowledge about the use of psychedelics in children, <br />and the &quot;oldest&quot; knowledge&quot; that we have regarding the use of such molecules in young persons is from such tribes - <br />I would argue that giving it to children is a bad idea and that the first dose shouldn&#039;t be given before the &quot;rite of passage&quot;.<br /><br />

				I feel like children shouldn&#039;t... Their brains are still developing- So that&#039;s a no go for any drug, plus they should probably get a better hold on their life before trying it. I know that might sound a bit off, but I don&#039;t have another way to phrase it...Lets try it this way- I don&#039;t want a child to experience an awesome burst of color, then start to think that life is boring.<br /><br />Or have a mental melt down.<br /><br />You know, either one.&nbsp; ;D

				I recall reading somewhere that they had a study where they discovered that the use of THC before the age of 18 actually does have a measurable, negative impact on brain development. I would think that psychedelics would probably have a much greater impact, not to mention as mentioned several times above the whole perspective thing. <br /><br />IMHO, when they do legalize drugs I would definitely be in favor of it not being allowed under 18, but only in conjunction with an overhauled drug education program that more accurately describes and better informs about in general the effects of drugs on your body. I remember during my health classes, both in middle and high school, that they did not actually teach you very much about ANY of the drugs except that they are bad (mkay?), and it was not until I began doing a lot of research on chems myself that I realized just how biased and uninformed the classes are. Frankly, that kind of pissed me off. Even in college, some of my friends in psychology classes have described to me the lectures on drugs, and while they are slightly more informative than in public school, they are still woefully lacking in solid information and are still very biased against them. <br /><br />Before we can think about legalizing drugs for use by anyone, ESPECIALLY children, we might want to first make sure that people are given easy, unrestricted, and as unbiased as possible access to information about chems. <br /><br />Got a little off topic there I think. Anything involving the backwardness of the educational/political systems tends to get me rather irritated. To return to the original question, I do not think drugs are good for anyone who has not fully developed physically, as we do not yet know the potential effects. We need a lot more information before we can make a good, solid decision.

				huh, I&#039;d like to know what that study was that found the use of THC before 18 caused irreversible damage. <br /><br />Fuck it, I&#039;ve been smoking pot since I was 13. Mushrooms at 15, LSD and MDMa at 16. Didn&#039;t start smoking regularly til about 15-16. it&#039;s probably too early to tell but I&#039;m rockin&#039; a 3.5 GPA at a decent college w/out much trouble, don&#039;t have trouble focusing, etc. When I wake up every morning I have never felt foggy, burned out, or any of that shit. I think some people are more prone to developing the notorious and often misused &#039;permafried&#039; state.<br /><br />However, I definitely wished I would&#039;ve waited until I was at least 16 to start using any drugs. To me, it is common sense to not allow children (under 14) to use any sort of drug. I really do not see the point or the benefit, why not wait a few years til the effects can actually be appreciated. I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll gain anything, and this is a shot in the dark but I think children would be a lot more prone to developing Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, which could fuck any child up mentally for a while, if not permanently.

				I will try to track it down for you and post it here. It was not a major impact, but it was large enough to be measured. I do not recall how extensive the tests were other than basic IQ tests, or which IQ tests were used. <br /><br />Thing is, THC is generally regarded (as far as I know) as being one of if not the softest drug out there. The fact that it has an impact at all may indicate that more intense drugs such as psychedelics could have an even more significant impact. Plus, I know several heavy users that have definite issues, although their level of competence has never exactly been incredibly high. And of course as you said, everyone reacts differently to chems, some people may have an inherently higher risk of negative long term effects from THC use than others. <br /><br />Why do you wish you would have waited? It sounds like you are doing alright academically, better than me in fact.

				Brain isn&#039;t &quot;fully developed&quot; until around 25. That is when the part that analyzes risk is more hardwired. I would postulate the brain not being fully developed is why drugs have the most cognitive altering benefits. When the brain is fully developed it is essentially become hardwired, for the most part at that point who you are changes very little. Sure experiences and knowledge add to the formula that is you, but you will have a core that is difficult to change. <br /><br />When drugs are taken prior to this stage I like to think people have the greatest philosophical gains. Memories and thoughts are not just electrical impulses they are chemical as well. When you have thoughts that lead to conviction they are strong when under the influence because a strong chemical state ingrains it. Kinda why time seems to go slower when someone is in a life or death situation, they are flooded with chemicals and in a flight or fight response your body&#039;s senses become more aware, all these above normal levels of chemicals and sensory perception add more to the memory making it appear as if time was slowed when it was just a heightened state of awareness.<br /><br />When teens are going through puberty their chemical balance is being defined and drugs during this time will alter it (no evidence that it is permanent but it makes sense to me, same as how the chemical state of the mother in the womb will not only affect the development of the baby but also the dna switches that are still happening which we all know are pretty permanent)<br /><br />tl;dr Brain fully develops around 25, philosophical ideas that occur before then especially on drugs become more ingrained, #opinion the optimum stage for personal development is after puberty and before 25.<br /><br />This isn&#039;t to say you don&#039;t benefit after that age (hell or even before), just myself postulating a maximum benefit time frame.<br /><br />One note; doctors prescribe drugs to children willy-nilly nowadays. If a child has cluster headaches... I wouldn&#039;t have a problem treating them with mushrooms. I&#039;d find a way to make it easier such as capsule form, taken before bed, and make the transition as easy as possible.

				Very interesting perspective, definitely something to think about...<br /><br />Did you know that fluoride which is in our water here in America but not in Europe destroys our pineal gland. Studies have found that &quot;calcified parts of the pineal gland (hydroxyapatite crystals) contain the highest fluoride concentrations in the human body&quot; (up to 21,000 ppm F) (link to this article: http://www.fluoridealert.org/issues/health/pineal-gland). <br /><br />Our pineal gland is our third eye and gives us the ability to see beneath and beyond the surface. Psychedellics like DMT awaken our third eye so you might be unto something when you say that psychedelics can enhance learning for children, even though the conventional thinking is that a child&#039;s brain is still developing so drugs should not be consumed during this vital and vulnerable stage........but the reality might be that it will result in stimulating certain neurotransmitters and in helping rewire the brain in a way that enhances learning.<br />

Basically Follow the money and that is who is controlling our food, economy, education, media to serve the interest of a select group of people and they want us dumb, gullible and easy to control and they want less of us around (control population).<br /><br />But your points are totally valid :) and I have not made up my mind either way on this proposal made by OP.<br />But is definitely an interesting topic to talk about and explore.

				My only request is that the findings of this study be replicated at least 5 or 6 more times and that during the study very light dosages are used as light as possible; in order for the results to be significant the results don&#039;t have to be dramatic, a small measurable change can be statistically significant. Also the parents need to be present during experiment and consent ofcourse.<br /><br />Great discussion.

I wouldn&#039;t give them to my kids. At such a young age, I feel that giving them knowledge is more important than anything. They should be able to make sense of the experience before they embark on it (or at least as much as any of us can&nbsp; ;) ).<br /><br />As much as I disagree with how many parents raise their children (or don&#039;t), every parent deserves to do things their way -- non-violently of course.

				My stringent belief is that once a person gets to a point of maturity where they can feasibly, reasonably, and consciously make decisions independently, then anything within reason, should be allowed. Now obviously this is very objective in which many variables can influence it, but the over-arching point is if you understand the pros and cons of taking said substance with responsibility and purpose, why not?<br /><br />Children however, are a completely different ballgame. I&#039;m all for the use of psychotropic compounds to expand ones consciousness and the human experience, or attempting to view existence from different perspectives, but in order for that to be achieved one must have already set that goal. I highly doubt most children have even the most basic knowledge of psychedelics, let alone their purpose in past civilizations and society, and how they can be used responsibly. Not only that but as many have said before, a child&#039;s mind is constantly growing and evolving. Introducing a highly potent psychedelic during that process to an unprepared mind, would just be asinine. I&#039;m completely in agreement that most drugs, especially psychedelics, have properties which heal and evolve the human consciousness in profound ways, but when used irresponsibly can also have very damaging effects and/or experiences. Messing with reality to someone who has yet to even begin to understand what reality is, is really taking shots in the dark. <br /><br />Childhood is something experienced only once. I&#039;m sure all of us have fond memories of our own youth. Now imagine you were introduced to psychedelics at an early age? How would all of that change for you? How would the way you experience your childhood and life change? What do children have to gain from psychedelics? The innocence of a child is a very fragile matter, and once that is lost then true childhood is essentially over.<br /><br />It&#039;s a very complex subject with little room to debate honestly. Psychedelics should be used only by those with purpose, understanding, and responsibility, or at the very least some maturity. <br /><br />To end with a popular cliche; there is a time and place for everything.

But what would we use psychedelics in children for exactly? Generally at that age, a very small minority are suffering from any type of mental &quot;disorder&quot;, and only begin to show signs of symptoms or predispositions at a later age. I absolutely agree with you, but one must consider the realistic scenarios of such a psychedelic being put to work. I would imagine if this concept were generally accepted, parents aren&#039;t going to be giving their children 100 mics of some L that a deadhead synthed in his trailer. The pharmaceutical companies would have to get involved in this one way or another.<br /><br />@moon unit - I was more under the impression that the OP was referring to simply accepted psychedelic use in children and/or overall in society, vs real-world, controlled environments where dosages, set/setting, etc, are all completely monitored. Like I said before, there is no doubt in my mind that psychedelics are extremely viable for a variety of mental conditions, under the right circumstances.<br /><br />I guess I was imagining Ma and Pa giving little Johnny a tab of some dancing bears to alleviate his anxiety before he goes to school lol.

I would think that psychedelics would probably have a much greater impact, not to mention as mentioned several times above the whole perspective thing. <br /><br />IMHO, when they do legalize drugs I would definitely be in favor of it not being allowed under 18, but only in conjunction with an overhauled drug education program that more accurately describes and better informs about in general the effects of drugs on your body. I remember during my health classes, both in middle and high school, that they did not actually teach you very much about ANY of the drugs except that they are bad (mkay?), and it was not until I began doing a lot of research on chems myself that I realized just how biased and uninformed the classes are. Frankly, that kind of pissed me off. Even in college, some of my friends in psychology classes have described to me the lectures on drugs, and while they are slightly more informative than in public school, they are still woefully lacking in solid information and are still very biased against them. <br /><br />Before we can think about legalizing drugs for use by anyone, ESPECIALLY children, we might want to first make sure that people are given easy, unrestricted, and as unbiased as possible access to information about chems. <br /><br />Got a little off topic there I think. Anything involving the backwardness of the educational/political systems tends to get me rather irritated. To return to the original question, I do not think drugs are good for anyone who has not fully developed physically, as we do not yet know the potential effects. We need a lot more information before we can make a good, solid decision.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I recall a similar (or perhaps the same) article in regards to neural development and juvenile neurons, maybe about 2-3 years ago at the most. It was speaking in reference to THC, which does have a negative impact on neurons in people under about 22-24 years of age. However, after that point, which is when most of the neural circuitry involved in interconnecting different brain areas has been established (i.e., one has learned to &quot;multitask&quot; as the magazine Scientific American had put it), the metabolic effects of THC were NOT detrimental to the brain. The researchers did not have an understanding of why this is.<br /><br />Today (13 March 2013) I found an article on the Google News page warning of the dangers of giving children psychotropic drugs, such as Zoloft, Paxil &amp; other SSRI&#039;s, and probably MAO inhibitors as the effects of those chemicals was unpredictable and potentially dangerous to developing brains. I think Raphael5 spoke correctly that people in Africa can take these compounds at the point in life where they enter manhood (or womanhood) - please forgive me if I mis-quoted you or credited the wrong person - it is at the early part of this thread. I also agree that these types of modern psychedelics (SSRI&#039;s, MAOI&#039;s) should only be given to juveniles with some type of extreme mental issues, not some parent&#039;s lack of proper raising of their child &amp; giving them Ridalin. <br /><br />I confess I have not read all the posts in this thread before I commented, but I do feel very strong about this issue, as do many others it seems.

A parents responsibility (since the governments don&#039;t do it) is give them a thorough education on the subject so that they can then decide for themselves if they want to take drugs or not.<br /><br />There&#039;s a difference between a father giving his son a shandy to make him feel big and grown up, and another altogether than dropping acid and listening to Hendrix!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m just trying to present that children, like adults, are highly variant. I would go so far as to say that some children grasp things better than many adults do. Despite this, as you say they have got a developing brain and should not be taking anything mind-altering. <br /><br />You are generalizing too much to say that children are unable to make decisions -- many are not, but many are -- and it obviously depends on age very much. When it comes to children I feel that we should give them more responsibility &amp; freedom that we do. I know that when I was 9 or 12, I would get pissed off whenever adults acted like they were automatically smarter or knew better just because they were older. This kind of arrogance doesn&#039;t translate well onto the child nor help them learn or become responsible. We never even give them a chance to prove themselves responsible -- or irresponsible for that matter, it is assumed. <br /><br />Of course I don&#039;t think that children should be having sex. But they shouldn&#039;t have their heads shoved into the sand regarding the subject. Most people can&#039;t even trust their kids to know things, so how can we trust them to educate their children? I really think that a good majority of parents absolutely fail their children -- but the thing is, if the kid starts showing an initiative to raise himself, to grow up one way or the other, that is stopped because it is looked at as a coup d&#039;état by the parents or whoever. No one raises their children to be self-reliant and especially not to think for themselves -- else they might not grow up the way the selfish parent wants them too. I&#039;m just saying -- let your children grow up themselves, or else they won&#039;t at all. Instead of making the child &quot;feel&quot; big by letting him drink the shandy, let him actually make some decisions on his own, and hint: you can still be in control if he makes the wrong decision, it&#039;s just about allowing him to practice decision-making at all.<br /><br />Back on the subject: kids should never taking mind-altering substances, or fuck each other. IMO, they should also never watch TV, as that warps a child&#039;s mind more than anything -- except maybe being raised to believe the religious lies that their parents do. You can&#039;t trust parents to &quot;parent&quot; children, in today&#039;s world, all they do is try to &quot;program&quot; them. <br /><br />When I said &quot;solve the root problem&quot; in my last post, I meant the fucking psychotic parent who is giving his god damn kid acid in the first place . Banning something, especially in children, makes them want to do it. If you simply discourage it&#039;s use -- especially if you actually tell them what you told me, &quot;that your brain is still developing and if you decide to take it, it should definitely be later when it&#039;s done,&quot; rather than, &quot;no, it&#039;s banned.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=121063.msg898796#msg898796">Quote from: JezuzWazaMushroom on March 14, 2013, 02:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wake up dude there&#039;s freedom and then there&#039;s parental guidance and ethics.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It would seem as if all parental guidance is nowadays is taking away a children&#039;s freedom. This is a generalized statement, so I hate saying it, but it applies on a large scale. <br /><br /><br />Long story short -- parents fail their children -- we blame the child. We need better parents across the board.
