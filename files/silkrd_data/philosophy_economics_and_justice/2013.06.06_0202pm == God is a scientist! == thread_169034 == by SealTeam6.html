				Continuing on my &quot;God is&quot; series, I posed this statement to my close friends.&nbsp; What if God is a scientist, a scientist who created the world, but, some how forgot that he created it!&nbsp; We all know how quirky and weird scientist are.&nbsp; I think God is a forgetful scientist, who created the world and forgot he did it, cause of course he&#039;s God, he does a lot of things.<br /><br />Second part to this is how do we remind God that we are here?&nbsp; Well, I think there are about two ways we can remind him.&nbsp; Either with hate, or Love.&nbsp; I of course choose love.&nbsp; I think if this scenario is possible we can wake God up with love and remind him why he created this beautiful world.
