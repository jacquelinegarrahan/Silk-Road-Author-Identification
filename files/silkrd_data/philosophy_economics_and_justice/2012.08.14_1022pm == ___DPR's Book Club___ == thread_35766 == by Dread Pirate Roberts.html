				Welcome to DPR&#039;s book club!&nbsp; Knowledge is power, and reading is one of the best ways to expand your knowledge.&nbsp; Each week, we will select a reading designed to expand our understanding of the issues that face the Silk Road community and have a group discussion on the material.&nbsp; My hope is that a high level of discourse will be fostered, and as a community, we can become strong in our beliefs, with a coherent message and voice as the world begins to take notice of us.<br /><br />We will focus on agorism, counter-economics, anarcho-capitalism, austrian economics, political philosophy, freedom issues and related topics.&nbsp; My hope is that through this, we will discover what we stand for and foster a culture of peace, prosperity, justice and freedom.&nbsp; There is so much double-speak and misinformation in the world today that we must take our education into our own hands, and defend our minds with reason and critical thinking.<br /><br />Here&#039;s how it will work:&nbsp; Each week we will start a thread for the material we will cover that week.&nbsp; The title will start with ***DPR&#039;s Book Club***.&nbsp; You will be free to begin discussion on the material as soon as you begin reading.&nbsp; There won&#039;t be an official ending to the thread, but we will begin the next one about one week later.<br /><br />Everyone is encouraged to participate in the discussion, even if you are adamantly opposed to any bias that may be in the reading, or any consensus that may form in the group.&nbsp; There are however a few guidelines that we must enforce to make sure we accomplish our goals.<br /><br />1) Remain civil at all times.&nbsp; If you disagree with something, debate the issue, don&#039;t attack the other participants.<br />2) Stay on topic.&nbsp; We can stray a little bit as the material stimulates discussion, but we want to always bring it back to the specific material that we are covering in the thread.<br />3) Forward the action.&nbsp; Try at all times to build on what has already been said.&nbsp; We don&#039;t want 10 ideas being discussed simultaneously.<br /><br />That&#039;s about it.&nbsp; DoctaFeelgood will be moderating for us.&nbsp; He is fairly new to the forum, but has a passion for the topics we&#039;ll cover, and is skilled in articulating the concepts and helping anyone with sticking points they may have.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Dread&nbsp; 8)

				Great idea for a new section. Does this mean that DPR has some leisure time now? :) <br /><br />PS - there should be a minimum post count in order to post here. I feel it would help keep the banter a bit more civilized. <br /><br />I.E - Everyone can read, but only 100 post people or more can post. Stops the trolls from creating brand new account just to argue.

				I think it is a sound proposal, I also agree with Shroom that you may want to create something like a post limit to prevent trolling though (I&#039;d prefer capcha to a post limit, but that&#039;s just my preference).<br /><br />Can we suggest reading material to whoever is appointed to select the books?

Unfortunately, he has taken out a comprehensive policy with Octogen Group Protection Insurance. Our agents were unable to penetrate his escort and we took heavy losses.<br />We regret to inform you that this will entail an increase in this years premium, as you have lost your no claims bonus.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally, we have reason to believe that OGPI have subcontracted a bounty for your neutralization.&nbsp; A hitsquad from EXecutive solutions is believed to be hunting you. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately you only paid for BRONZE level protection. This means we can no longer guarantee your safety if you remain in your own home.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, for a slight increase in your monthly payment, we would like to offer you a place in our new enclave,&nbsp; Insurance Fortress 9B. Here behind our razor wire we feel sure you will feel more comfortable, knowing your family is guarded 24/7 by our highly trained merc squads.

				Sorry we haven&#039;t started yet have we? I thought that must be the book in DPR&#039;s signature.

It shouldn&#039;t be just books from the shelves of a literati either, it&#039;s good to mix up lighter stuff with smaller amounts of denser material. e.g. I advocate everybody read extracts from the Wealth of Nations, but I wouldn&#039;t be advocating people read all the volumes, 20 or 30 pages is far far more material than the majority of writers can cram into an entire bookshelf. Similarly I think Hayak and Friedman are more potent in small doses. A Lodging of Wayfaring Men on the other hand can be read fairly quickly (this book described Bitcoin/SR ages before they even existed, it&#039;s eerie to read it now!).<br /><br />One socialist author that should get a look in is George Orwell. 1984 is a truly remarkable book and much fewer people have read it than heard of it.<br /><br />Books! The First Internet :)<br /><br />They seem like opposites to me. With the Internet you have a tremendous range of knowledge, but it is frequently shallow knowledge, not deep like books, but the literati and digitari are both explorers of the mind, so they are complimentary. Many people love books but can hardly find the time to read them all, so book clubs are definitely a good idea on general principals. It is like going to the Book Gym! If you are a Spartan of the body and an Athenian of the mind, you have a lot going for you right there.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				I like this idea, but I believe it is important that dissenting opinions are also respected. It&#039;s the libertarian thing to do.<br /><br />It is infinitely better to also read and openly discuss material you disagree with it, than to only feed the readers biased literature. This forum is an excellent location for open debate, because governments cannot censor it.<br /><br />The only people who can censor the discussion here are DPR and the mods. My request to them is: please don&#039;t.

However, DPR wanted a specific theme for *his* book club and I am merely referring to which books we will be reading. I am just trying to say that the bible probably won&#039;t be something chosen for a reading assignment. If you wish to debate religious views in a non-bashing and respectful manner, you are absolutely free to go start a thread and begin. I am not here to censor anyone. The only posts I will remove are spam like Mt. Gix and Btkoin. I simply ask that you treat each other with respect and keep an open mind.

				I don&#039;t mind the first book or future books being libertarian. If you have a huge issue reading things that you disagree with, then maybe you need to evaluate your own opinions to see how strong they are. It&#039;s easy to read a book where you&#039;re nodding your head the whole time; it&#039;s much harder to do as I am with this libertarian reading, having to really think out the things he&#039;s saying to poke holes in his arguments. I love that kind of stuff, mental stimulation and all that. I imagine that in the future we&#039;ll have books from all different political spectrums to keep things interesting. I think that religion could be an interesting future topic. Although considering the nature of the site, I think it might be more interesting to get into spirituality from maybe a pantheistic or deistic viewpoint rather than attacking Christianity, because frankly that&#039;s been done to death at this point. Although I&#039;m atheist, some of the newer spirituality movements have given me pause, and some of my experiences with psychedelics have led me to believe that pantheism might not be so far from the truth. It would be interesting to explore. But DPR runs the show, so I&#039;ll read whatever he wants to discuss. I trust him to pick some interesting topics.

I found this fitting quote from Burgess himself about the 21st chapter:<br /><br />&quot;The 21st chapter gives the novel the quality of genuine fiction, an art founded on the principle that human beings change.&quot;<br /><br />That being said, the &quot;evil&quot; glare from Alex in the end of the movie is not the &quot;whole&quot; story. The 21st chapter has him realizing the ease of destruction relative to creation. I read it a long time ago, but it almost seemed, to me, that he stops being destructive in his ways because it was &quot;not cool&quot; anymore. It may draw parallels to medical marijuana because once someone realizes the ease in breaking a vase (or a law) it becomes non-desired due to the fact that the thrill is lost. Alex is always going for the &quot;thrill&quot; but no longer sees it his ways. Thus, change.<br /><br />

At first Alex tries to taunt him out of his &#039;safe&#039; life, but he&#039;s &#039;evolved&#039; out of all the kid stuff and you see Alex is left impressed by his friend&#039;s maturity.

				About to read escape from evil by Ernest Becker. Can&#039;t wait.<br /><br />The Denial of Death was the most profound book I&#039;ve ever read and changed my life in many ways. It was like coming into the clear after a lifetime of confusion and fog about how this land of the mind worked and just why I and everyone else was just so damn batshit crazy. Well this wasn&#039;&#039;t all good as my comfort blanket against the night was thoroughly ripped away but I would recommend anyone who is interested in learning the &quot;truth&quot; about humans and why we behave as we do, why we have so many fantasies, hopes, dreams, terrors, delusion and attachments to give it a go.<br /><br />Also been listening to Henry Miller&#039;s own reading of his book &quot;To Paint is to Love Again&quot; So far it&#039;s brilliant, very relaxing as has inspired me to; in his own words &quot;Paint as you like and die happy&quot;.

Obviously, &#039;Man, Economy, and State&#039; is THE book on austrian economics.<br /><br />David Friedman&#039;s &#039;Machinery of Freedom&#039; is a highly entertaining read and offers the Chicago-approach to anarcho-capitalism.<br /><br />George J. Stigler&#039;s &#039;The Citizen and the State&#039; is quite good, but a lot less &quot;grand&quot; in scope. It focuses only on regulation and the phenomenon of regulatory capture.<br /><br />And if this all seems a bit overwhelming, Bob Murphy&#039;s &#039;Lessons for the Young Economist&#039; is an excellent introduction to austrian economics.<br /><br />Lastly, I&#039;d replace Hayek&#039;s &#039;Road To Serfdom&#039; by his essay &#039;The Use of Knowledge in Society&#039; and then either his last book &#039;The Fatal Conceit&#039; or &#039;The Constitution of Liberty&#039;. I disagree strongly with the statement that &#039;Serfdom&#039; is his masterwork as he hardly even touches upon his most important concept of spontaneous order at all..

				Having looked at the recommendations above, I should note that I have some familiarity with economics in general.&nbsp; In fact, my username is actually a hint.&nbsp; <br /><br />Instead of recommending a list of books, I would like ask for something else: if you could recommend just one book or work regarding economics for someone to read and understand, regardless of difficulty, what would that one work be?&nbsp; Ideally, this will get some responses where people have thought about what they think the most important work on economics is.&nbsp; I would ask that you please confine your answer to only one book or work.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks!

				I confess I am also a reader!<br /><br />I ind it hard to list my top ten books as its imnpossible really.<br /><br />I would say try some of the ancient philosophers&nbsp; just to see if we are progressing with regards to our intellectual capacity to understand human nature and life itself. <br /><br />Here are a few quotes by the Greek philosophers of the day.....<br /><br />A small rock holds back a great wave. ~ Homer<br /><br />No man loves life like him that&#039;s growing old. ~ Sophocles<br /><br />The destiny of man is in his own soul. ~ Herodotus<br /><br />The good and the wise lead quiet lives. ~ Euripedes<br /><br />Natural forces within us are the true healers of disease. ~ Hippocrates<br /><br />Let each man exercise the art he knows. ~ Aristophanes<br /><br />Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. ~ Plato<br /><br />All virtue is summed up in dealing justly. ~ Aristotle (good one for traders and buyers alike!)<br /><br />The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God. ~ Euclid<br /><br />If forced to suggest 2 books I would recommend George Orwells 1984 and Aldous Huxleys &#039;Brave New World&#039;. These two books combined, seem to actually predict a lot of what is going on today! Read them, you will be shocked.<br /><br />I read a lot of English history and it always amazes me how the Victorians were so productive! They had access to drugs which we would trully rave about! Pure cocaine HCL, pure morphine, even speed in later times. They had cannabis tincture, hash and cannabis which would bring a 5/5 here from even the most fussy of tokers.<br /><br />In the 70s, Valium by Roche became the &#039;cure all&#039; drug handed to anyone who had ANY mental issues, stress or e3ven insecurity. O copurse I tried,, but diazepam is a unny drug - some can go out and drink on it - I tend to sip hal a pint and pretty much its head on the table time or me! So, I use it only as a &#039;come down&#039; drug in case I&#039;m on any stimulant and, of late, had some wierd shift hours so it helps to sleep when I&#039;m wired up a little. <br /><br />One book I can reccommend, a book which opened my eyes a lot is the book &#039;And the Band Played On&#039;. Its a very big book and details the history o how aids first began to show up in the USA and the dedicated doc whose effforts, with others. led to the disease being recognised and for preventative measures to be taken.<br /><br />I also like some poetry also, plus some horror, but not much.<br /><br />I also like reading the old childrens classics we all read as kids! These books show how a book is written - the skill of the writers and their aility to bring you into the story is amazing.<br /><br />I am also the co author of a safety manuel! <br /><br />I also like to write short stories, had a few published! These are magazine stories and to be honest I basically just make something up and get a couple to split the money! <br /><br />I also got told off at work for writing a short story about a lesbien who had access to pharm grade drugs o all descriptions. The story line was that she seduces some chick but invites me to the party! I thought it was well written, but the boss panicked in case the emails got out to the high up bosses.<br /><br />I&#039;m currently writing a guide to the female orgasm. Had it printed on business-cards. My advice is to drink 8 cans of bitter, watch match of the day - then she will come if your team win. Also, all you got to do is offer her some LSD, that way you actually make love ina real profound way!<br /><br />With cocaine, its more a case of keep on banging as hard as you can and for as long as you can.<br /><br />I&#039;m so good I can knock my chick out, have her snoring because I&#039;ve obviously banged her into dreamland!<br /><br />Trouble is, banging an unconcious woman is non consensual - so of course I have to roll off the point of the Zzzzz Orgasm.<br /><br />My next book is &#039;gay sex for the straight guy&#039;. I explain how you can bond with the bros but without being gay! You basically put a rubber mask of Kylie Minogue on them -put some football on, drink 8 cans and well, whatever!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D<br /><br />But sure, reading is important!!!!!! <br /><br /><br /><br />

				There was a book i had a while back which i can&#039;t find anymore.<br /><br />Made in the 70&#039;s and called something like &quot;how to take cocaine&quot; or something. It had information on the best way to take coke at parties, note rolling techniques, how to store it, etc. I found it cute and very funny. Also quite informative! Anyone know what book this might have been?

				Hi all, love this thread, the current book, The creature from Jeckyll Island has long been a favourite. Just wondering if there are any F Paul Wilson fans here. I preferred Enemy of the State to Alongside Night, although i did love both. The repariman jack series is also a lot of fun, i highly recommend to everybody. Enemy of the state is about a non violent revolution to overthrow an oppressive government and is very well written.

				Thanks to Capslockian for having a great user name and finding us a treasure trove of information.<br /><br />My Kindle overflows!<br /><br />Show me a well read man or women and I&#039;ll show you someone who can have a conversation.<br /><br />Actually, we have a good philisophical discussion going on in work right now.<br /><br />Well, more like &#039;who has the best hash&#039; conversation, but we are at the stage of being stoned before noon so the conversation is pretty varied. One premise we are debating is that you cannot have a civilised society until a certain percentage of people like to get high and read.<br /><br />I love going to old book shops after a sly joint.<br /><br />I&#039;ve got 3 book cases plus over 1 million e-books.<br /><br />Not got round to reading all those so if someone has a cure for death, I&#039;ll pay a few btc for that then go to the pub and announce mny immortality (to jeers)<br /><br />Yup, this dying shit is a bummer for us readers.

				Hey all, yeah I agree, I don&#039;t want this thread to die either. Maybe DPR&#039;s too busy dealing with the feedback overhaul to be worrying about his reading lists. I&#039;ve been doing a lot of reading this summer. Been tearing through some Charles Bukowski novels. So far I&#039;ve read Invisible Monsters, Ham on Rye, Hollywood, Choke and I&#039;m just getting into another of his. He wrote Fight Club and if you enjoyed that then you&#039;d definitely enjoy these. He used to sit at the typewriter powering through several bottles of wine and writing in the evening and then he&#039;d delete some of it the next day, but a lot of it he&#039;d keep. He&#039;s great, very funny and engrossing and you feel sad when you&#039;ve finished the novel. Out of them all I enjoyed Invisible Monsters the most, although they were all great. I read Women too which was just him going on about all the tail he got after he became semi famous and him drinking loads. Boys, if you&#039;re in dire need of getting laid, become a published author like your Uncle Chuck!
