				(ClearNet) http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/court-says-drug-dogs-sniff-at-front-door-is-unconstitutional-search/2013/03/26/cd02ce84-9621-11e2-8764-d42c128a01ef_story.html <br /><br />Court says drug dog’s sniff at front door is unconstitutional search<br /><br /><br />By Associated Press, Updated: Tuesday, March 26, 11:14 AM<br /><br />WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that police cannot bring drug-sniffing police dogs onto a suspect’s property to look for evidence without first getting a warrant for a search, a decision which may limit how investigators use dogs’ sensitive noses to search out drugs, explosives and other items hidden from human sight, sound and smell.<br /><br />The high court split 5-4 on the decision to uphold the Florida Supreme Court’s ruling throwing out evidence seized in the search of Joelis Jardines’ Miami-area house. That search was based on an alert by Franky the drug dog from outside the closed front door.<br />Justice Antonin Scalia said a person has the Fourth Amendment right to be free from the government’s gaze inside their home and in the area surrounding it, which is called the curtilage.<br /><br />“The police cannot, without a warrant based on probable cause, hang around on the lawn or in the side garden, trawling for evidence and perhaps peering into the windows of the home,” Justice Antonin Scalia said for the majority. “And the officers here had all four of their feet and all four of their companion’s, planted firmly on that curtilage — the front porch is the classic example of an area intimately associated with the life of the home.”<br /><br />He was joined in his opinion by Justices Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.<br /><br />On the morning of Dec. 5, 2006, Miami-Dade police detectives and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents set up surveillance outside a house south of the city after getting an anonymous tip that it might contain a marijuana growing operation. Detective Douglas Bartelt arrived with Franky and the two went up to the house, where Franky quickly detected the odor of pot at the base of the front door and sat down as he was trained to do.<br /><br />That sniff was used to get a search warrant from a judge. The house was searched and its lone occupant, Jardines, was arrested trying to escape out the back door. Officers pulled 179 live marijuana plants from the house, with an estimated street value of more than $700,000.<br /><br />Jardines was charged with marijuana trafficking and grand theft for stealing electricity needed to run the highly sophisticated operation. He pleaded not guilty and his attorney challenged the search, claiming Franky’s sniff outside the front door was an unconstitutional law enforcement intrusion into the home.<br /><br />The trial judge agreed and threw out the evidence seized in the search, but that was reversed by an intermediate appeals court. In April a divided Florida Supreme Court sided with the original judge.<br /><br />The Supreme Court’s decision upholds that ruling.<br /><br />“A drug detection dog is a specialized device for discovering objects not in plain view (or plain smell),” Kagan wrote in a concurring opinion. “That device here was aimed at a home — the most private and inviolate (or so we expect) of all the places and things the Fourth Amendment protects. Was this activity a trespass? Yes, as the court holds today. Was it also an invasion of privacy? Yes, that as well.”<br /><br />The four justices who dissented were Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Samuel Alito.<br /><br />It’s not trespassing when a mail carrier comes on a porch for a brief period, Alito said. And that includes “police officers who wish to gather evidence against an occupant,” Alito said. “According to the court, however, the police officer in this case, Detective Bartelt, committed a trespass because he was accompanied during his otherwise lawful visit to the front door of the respondent’s house by his dog, Franky. Where is the authority evidencing such a rule?”<br /><br />Alito also said that the court’s ruling stretches expectations of privacy too far.<br /><br />“A reasonable person understands that odors emanating from a house may be detected from locations that are open to the public, and a reasonable person will not count on the strength of those odors remaining within the range that, while detectable by a dog, cannot be smelled by a human.”

				There&#039;s hope for this country after all!<br /><br />God Bless America!<br /><br />Such a bi-partisan agreement!&nbsp; You can&#039;t get anymore polar opposites together on one issue. Ginsberg +Kagen agreeing with Thomas and Scalia? - That is just beautiful. <br /><br />You&#039;ve renewed my faith in this country. One can really get down reading about how Obama was connected to the same Cabal of Banksters as Bush and those before him. <br /><br />I needed that shot of true &#039;Hope&#039;. - Not change. The constitution works. Capitalism works. <br /><br />This &#039;police state&#039; shit has to really be turned down a notch.

				&nbsp; http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/19970303.htm<br /><br />QUESTION: Do you see much evidence of a revolutionary spirit in the America of the 1990s?<br /><br />CHOMSKY: You didn&#039;t find evidence of it in the America of the 1790s. The Revolutionary War was an important event. But it was in the first place, to a significant extent, a civil war, as most revolutionary wars are. And it was a war of independence, as opposed to a revolution against the social structure. The social structure didn&#039;t really change significantly. There were problems right after the war was done. For example, Shay&#039;s Rebellion and the Whiskey Rebellion and so on were challenging the social structure, and there were efforts on the part of radical farmers to take seriously the meaning of the words in the revolutionary pamphlets, but that was pretty well quieted down.<br /><br />If you go back to the record of the Constitutional Convention, which took place in 1787, almost immediately after the end of the war, you see that they are already moving in another direction. James Madison -- who was the main framer, and one of the founding fathers who was most libertarian -- makes it very clear that the new constitutional system must be designed so as to insure that the government will, in his words &quot;protect the minority of the opulent against the majority&quot; and bar the way to anything like agrarian reform. The determination was made that America could not allow functioning democracy, since people would use their political power to attack the wealth of the minority of the opulent. Therefore, Madison argues, the country should be placed in the hands of the wealthier set of men, as he put it.

With a first lady constantly bathing in opulence, and her husband doing nothing to hide his associations with billionaire banksters, I had totally given in to a &quot;this is the end&quot; theory in the back of my mind. <br /><br />The post of the SCOTUS Ruling was very affirming to me, that while, yes I know it&#039;s not a perfect system, it is one of the imperfect ones I choose to rely on, and hope that it&#039;s given a chance. <br />When you can see clearly that there were mixed feelings, between left + right, on this, and where you had two polar opposites agree, was heartening, to me. I&#039;ll still take the constitution of the US, over any other one right now. As the ruling was a &#039;win&#039; for the people. I really got hope for a change! - pun truly not intended!<br /><br />When you see day after day, the attacks on the constitution by these leftover 60&#039;s revolutionary types, being given permissions and duties, that clearly shouldn&#039;t be in MOST of this administrations hands, if not all. Then to only have a once strident media, melt away into nothing but stenographers, waiting for the talking points to come out of the White House so they have something to &quot;report&quot; on. There hasn&#039;t been any &#039;reporting&#039;. True investigative &#039;reporting&#039; stopped with Obama getting elected the first time. <br /><br />It was beginning to look like a communist revolution was taking place. With the whole occupy actors, and the silent media doing nothing to investigate that their chosen one for the Presidency was (A) Qualified, and (B) Living up to expectations, which we know now are both big NO&#039;s !!

Then I was detained FOREVER (about an hour) and grilled over and over again with the same questions. Finally, the k9 unit showed up - circled the car four times with no indication. Finally, the handler took him to the furthest corner of the car from where I was standing and I saw him give a hand command (different from all the ones he had been using up until this point) and the dog halfheartedly scratched the window a couple times.

They grilled me for a good 20 minutes after they searched it trying to get me to admit to something. I have to admit I was a smart ass as much as I dared at that point. I knew the car was clean. <br /><br />I would love to hear people&#039;s experiences with getting pulled over and avoiding search.<br /><br />For example, I suspect that the first experience accounted above was largely due to the fact that the officer told me to sit with him in his car while he wrote me a warning for the bullshit traffic stop.
