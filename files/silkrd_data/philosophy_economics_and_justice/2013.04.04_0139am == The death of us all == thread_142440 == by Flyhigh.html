				Awesome work! Truly the job of a hero +1<br /><br />Fascinating stuff, had never contemplated combining harmalas with acid or smoked DMT...<br /><br />[Probably because, once you&#039;ve tasted them, you&#039;ll go out of your way to make sure you don&#039;t ever have to taste them again... :-X&nbsp; ]<br /><br />Peace, love and gratitude!

				Thank you so much for this post! I truly appreciate you taking time to post this. And I especially enjoyed reading every single word. Hell, I even went to the newbie section to make my 50 posts in order to thank you!<br /><br />I have a question though...Is this the entire book? It seems that some of the parts are not included. I am referencing the part where he says to look at DMT ~ Water Spirit<br /><br />Anyway thank you again! I will spread this around my group of people as they enjoy these things as much as I do. I feel like everyone should read this especially the last part about the history of psychedelics and how they have influenced us as human beings.<br /><br />DeeMeeTree

				This...is going to be a very essential thread! <br /><br />Like a psychedelic advent calendar&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />So, now I know I can try smoking that bitter-as-hell Syrian Rue extract I have somewhere for a pleasant high.<br /><br />Also, the last time I ingested SR (the rue, not the entire site!) prior to some DMT (a waste, you need massive quantities compared to smoking IMHO) I finished up the day with some K. Definitely one of my best K holes, with OoBEs and everything. Wondered if K must like a MAOI environment too. Makes sense given the -amine following the Ket-&nbsp; Hardly scientific, but it will do for me...<br /><br />On another note, ashamed to say I had not come across DM Turner&#039;s writings til the OP&#039;s massive act of generosity. I had heard of &quot;the guy in the bathtub&quot; but had no idea of the tragic loss of such an inspirational intellect. Have tried to make amends in the last 24 hours, and he definitely deserves a much wider audience.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure the elves are happy to have him back with them...

				Flyhigh, again, thank you so much for sharing this with us. I don&#039;t think you understand how much reading these posts means to me! I know that I have at least over 100 hours of researching various psychedelics, but nothing has been able to describe the world of psychedelics as this book has to me. I am truly grateful for your posts to the forum!<br /><br />I have had a great understand of psychedelics, but reading these posts have made even more sense especially in relation to one another. The combination he describes are wonderful and I cannot wait to try them!<br /><br />Again thank you so much for your posts! I really do appreciate this and the people I share this with also send their thank yous! <br /><br />Is this the entire book or are there more parts to this? If there are please share them with us!<br /><br />DeeMeeTree

				thank u bro the true information about how healthy these psychedelics are for our brains/where they came from is being hidden... LSD is in our brain! along with marijuana, DMT, mescaline, peyote and psilocybin. These things are good for us, its been proven that they cure many sicknesses and its virtually impossible to overdose on any of them. Fuck the bullshit gov. controlled mainstream media.
