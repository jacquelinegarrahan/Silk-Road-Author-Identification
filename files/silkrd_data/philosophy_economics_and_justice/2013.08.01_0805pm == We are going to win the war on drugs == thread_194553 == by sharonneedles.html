				Friends, it has come to my attention that there are skeptics among you who do not perceive what I perceive, who do not dream what I dream. Today is a groundbreaking day for it marks the day of the first country to fully legalise and control cannabis. Uruguay is this country and we should celebrate their relentless courage and strength in bringing an end to the global war on drugs.<br /><br />This will have a huge effect on international law. For Uruguay will now have to pull out of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is likely they will resubmit for compliance with harder drugs but with the clause that cannabis is legal. If this condition becomes accepted then it will set precedence for other countries who will be reassured that there will not no consequences for legalising cannabis. And why stop there?<br /><br />If Uruguay take it a step further they could pull out of the Convention and not reapply at all - they could draw up a whole new convention for the legalisation of cannabis (or all drugs) and ask countries to sign on. <br /><br />This news will surely tempt Latin American countries who already have drugs decriminalised. Most European countries have a de facto legalisation and could too follow suit.<br /><br />Today is the day which puts an end to skepticism around the global war on drugs. Do not submit to the doubts that the powers at be plant in your head. Stand up and continue to fight the fight which you believe to be right. Do not give up and become the victim of fear. <br /><br />As I type this thousands of people continue to transact in drug sales over this one website worldwide. Think of all the websites like this one and all the street deals that are currently under way. There is no putting an end to drugs, this is an inherent truth in our nature and to deny this is to deny nature. Therefore to deny our inevitable victory in the war on drugs is to become unnatural, defeatist and fearful.<br /><br />We are going to win the war on drugs&nbsp; :)

				I assume you&#039;re talking specifically about the US, and only specifically certain states within the US. Because there is no more prosecution in Uruguay, Latin America and most of EU and Australia for personal amounts of drugs (some countries only weed but others all drugs).<br /><br />+karma for you despite the skepticism ;)

				I think it&#039;s insane to believe that we&#039;re going to win the war on drugs. With marijauana for example, even if it was legalized in all 50 states, the fact remains it would be socially unacceptable to use it. Obviously there&#039;s a lot of people who could careless, but the vast majority of the population isn&#039;t going to do anything that&#039;s socially unacceptable. So legalizing and regulating marijuana in one country doesn&#039;t seem like much of a victory.<br /><br />I personally do not see how it&#039;s going to happen in America anyways, especially with the pharmaceutical companies and their resources (and aren&#039;t alcohol companies worth billions?).&nbsp; We would need to overcome too many powerful special interests.&nbsp; To me, winning the war on drugs would mean people are able to freely purchase all drugs. But how many doctors would that put out of business? The impact on the medical industry alone would be insane. Pharmaceutical companies would no longer be able to come out with new products and make billions, so they would unite and try to make sure it never happens. It would totally change the landscape of... everything. Such an extreme change just wouldn&#039;t be allowed to happen.<br /><br />I understand that no one wants to hear this, but winning a few battles doesn&#039;t mean anything significant in terms of the overall war. In the end, the perception of society is key, and too many younger people are still weak. They grow into adults just as complacent and scared to go against society as everyone else. As long as that remains the trend, we&#039;re going to continue losing.

Look at the courage of the Middle East over the few years and Turkey recently. This tells me that people are courageous when it comes down to it. Of course many fascist counties like UK and US try to impede on peoples freedom. I dont blame this on the people. London riots proved that people do not stand for bullshit.<br /><br />When drugs become an issue worthy of people to stand for then we will see a worldwide paradigmatic shift. the average Joe has no idea about the benefits of legalising drugs so it is up to us to provide that awareness and bring education to the public light.<br /><br />For me I think anyone that says the war on drugs will win are the same people who youve described - scared and not willing to fight for their beliefs. Go out and protest and see how many people agree with you. The more people do this the faster we will win.

I can hardly think of anyone in that range that hasn&#039;t done it, much less that would stigmatize someone else who does and I grew up in a land where people think Obama is a terrorist. I can easily see marijuana being comparable to alcohol in the next ten years.

				Be a little more weary of the situation... all&nbsp; is quiet for the&nbsp; moment, and in my experience, is when the fan hits the shit. All it could take is 1 kid who gets to fucked up from something he got on SR, OD&#039;s in school or something,and&nbsp; every news station will start slinging accusations , misinformation, and insinuations&nbsp; &nbsp;about SR trying to make us look as though we spawned from the unholy bowels of internet hell. Then the cops start trying to be the white knights, and before you know it, SR has gone the way of napster and bitcoins&nbsp; are&nbsp; illegal. <br />Itll be a long time before the persecution will cease Im affraid

				Let&#039;s look a bit further into the future, folks. Many of you are probably aware that 3D printing is going to be huge in the not too distant future. It&#039;ll be a massive gamechanger - highly decentralised manufacturing. The technology&#039;s getting cheaper and smaller.<br /><br />3D printing technology has great potential applications in pharmaceutical production. Yes, you could well be able to print your own drugs :)<br /><br />OK it probably won&#039;t be as simple as sticking an ink cartridge in a modern printer (but perhaps it will be, who knows?), trading in small amounts of restricted precursors may still be necessary and these would be where the main danger of LE interception lies, but the point is that the market will become highly fragmented, flooded with small time producers using freely available software to create their own gear of consistent quality for personal use for minimal cost. There would be a lot less money in it so organised crime would exit, coppers might be able to pinch users but the days of multi-million dollar busts in shipping containers would be well and truly over. <br /><br />In such a scenario, prosecuting the War On Drugs just wouldn&#039;t pay dividends anymore. <br /><br />

				Just wait for the rest of Latin America to turn against the UN and Western world for allowing this shit screen of the war on drugs to cover up the disasters in their countries, they will all legalise drugs and will follow Uruguay, then we will have new international law.<br /><br />This is it. Uruguay have started something huge and we will realise this by 2016 when new UN law will be adopted.<br /><br />Keep the fight going and fuck people who will discourage you and demotivate you, they are not going to accomplish shit in their lives. Why not stand for change in your life so you can save the lives of millions of people victim to the war on drugs.

				Fear not, dear friends. We will win on all fronts, not just the War On Drugs. Technology of all kinds is decentralising. Take energy. The government subsidised renewables - forget that crap. Anything that can&#039;t stand on its own two feet won&#039;t. In half a century, we could well be drawing massive volumes of power from small, failsafe (and I mean genuinely failsafe) nuclear-powered generators in our basements. And cheap energy = better standards of living. There will be a point in the future when energy is superabundant and will be of negligible cost. Our lifestyles at that point will be radically, radically different. Money, gold, commodities...these are promissory notes on energy, which is scarce, even today. The wealthy are wealthy because the amount of energy they can direct. However, energy superabundance will ultimately mean we can all do just about anything we like. This could happen in our lifetimes.<br /><br />Point being...I know it can be hard to see beyond the formidable apparatus the state has constructed to destroy the trade in what they call narcotics. But things change. If you could borrow a time machine and take a 1950s manufacturing worker - perhaps even a senior manager - who lived and worked in Detroit back then out on a tour around that city today, they would be shaken to the core. Look at the photos of the scores of abandoned posh hotels, office complexes, financial institutions, hospitals, churches, colleges and so on. Now they are decrepit and decaying, but were once glittering, gilded edifices. Detroit was very, very, very wealthy city not all that long ago. Bureaucratic inertia&#039;s inadequate ability to effectively adapt to technological developments and restructure the industry based on the new realities caused the decline of Detroit from one of the richest American cities to the poorest.<br /><br />Similarly, the great bureaucratic edifice of LE may utilise technological advancements in their prosecution of the War on Drugs, but ultimately the supply landscape will fundamentally change due to technological developments that will greatly empower consumers.<br /><br />The War On Drugs will simply no longer be viable in the future.

				You see, With uruguay they can just say, &quot;we legalized it to take the money away from the cartels,&quot; There are no gangs like that in europe. People dont run around with Ak&#039;s. (MOSTLY) <br />Dont get me wrong, there are actually plenty of people who probably do. But it is VERY different to latin america. Imagine mexico, Or south africa ? The corruption there is on a completely different scale to here.<br />Lets say the Uk citizens said we want the same in this country. The government would just say fuck off, There is no cartel control here, We could argue it would take money away from criminals, But they really dont give a shit about it.

We just want to go a step further and do like Uruguay have.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hold on, so you&#039;re saying that there are countries where you can walk into a pharmacy and buy anything without a prescription? And there&#039;s also a way to purchase psychedelics and other drugs that get you high? I&#039;m not saying I doubt you, I&#039;d just really like to see how opposing businesses are handling that. The reason why it doesn&#039;t matter to me is because I completely agree that the war on drugs is a US thing, it seems impossible for the war on drugs to be won here (I probably should&#039;ve specified in my post that I was referring to the US).<br />&nbsp;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=194553.msg1404136#msg1404136">Quote from: sharonneedles on August 02, 2013, 07:35 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I dont think this is true. Look at the courage of the Middle East over the few years and Turkey recently. This tells me that people are courageous when it comes down to it. Of course many fascist counties like UK and US try to impede on peoples freedom. I dont blame this on the people. London riots proved that people do not stand for bullshit.<br /><br />When drugs become an issue worthy of people to stand for then we will see a worldwide paradigmatic shift. the average Joe has no idea about the benefits of legalising drugs so it is up to us to provide that awareness and bring education to the public light.<br /><br />For me I think anyone that says the war on drugs will win are the same people who youve described - scared and not willing to fight for their beliefs. Go out and protest and see how many people agree with you. The more people do this the faster we will win.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yeah, the Middle East and other countries are definitely different than the US because the US really has shit locked down socially to the point where I can&#039;t imagine enough courageous people existing in this lifetime to win the war on drugs. But my point is, I agree 100% that the average Joe has no idea about the benefits of legalizing drugs, and until that happens, we&#039;re nowhere near close to winning. And I say that because: our opponents are the reason the average Joe has no idea about the benefits. They are clearly winning in that aspect (arguably the most important aspect)... It&#039;s what allows drugs to be illegal, it&#039;s what allows for the prison sentences, etc. I think that providing awareness and education means we&#039;re making progress, but I&#039;d really hesitate to say that we&#039;re winning (again, in terms of the US).<br /><br />If I went out and protested, the minority would agree with me. And others who did agree would do nothing because of how our society views drugs. And that indicates to me that we&#039;re not winning. If you look at how much effort is going on to get weed decriminalized, it is absolutely insane, and it&#039;s still federally illegal. If I went to people and said, &quot;let&#039;s try to decriminalize cocaine or LSD,&quot; they&#039;d look at me like I was crazy for thinking such a thing is possible.

				Here&#039;s a shallow argument from a previous poster:<br /><br />&quot;With marijauana for example, even if it was legalized in all 50 states, the fact remains it would be socially unacceptable to use it. &quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />The fact actually is that the social acceptance of CANNABIS is what is bringing its decriminalization and legalization to many States within the Union. I hate when people refer to it as &quot;Marijuana&quot; ... such cop-like terminology.

				Huge change can happen, I’m optimistic.<br /><br />Only 100 years ago racism was deeply embedded in parts of the US. The KKK was a powerful organisation that included senators. Politicians would have their photographs taken at lynchings to show their support. <br /><br />Where are the KKK today? People see them as a joke, a bunch of hillbilly’s. Racism has receded a great deal.<br /><br />Organised religion’s hold on peoples minds and opinions would have once seemed as concrete as the war on drugs does today. Who could have thought that people can directly and openly challenge (and mock) the claims of religion, as some writers like Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris do today. Atheists can, and do get elected to power (Jose Mujica president of Uruguay, Julia Gillard primeminister (until a few weeks ago) of Australia).

				Yes, change will come for sure - as you say, there are many things we consider normal today that were frowned upon or even illegal last century. Tolerance has improved tenfold for many minority groups, although their struggles are far from over. We have seen dramatic attitude shifts. <br /><br />Likewise, the normality of recreational drug use is pushing its way into mainstream consciousness. Ignorance breeds fear and panic but each new generation is more familiar with the realities of drugs, as opposed to the &#039;dope fiends&#039; panic propagated by 1950s media. It&#039;s no longer just users who see that current drug policies cause more harm than good.<br /><br />An example of generational cultural change: today I know mothers who have supervised their teenage daughters first mdma experience. The papers would denounce such irresponsible parenting, when in fact it&#039;s the opposite. Drug culture is a right of passage for the majority of teenagers. These mothers grew up raving, and want to ensure their kids safety when they start experimenting. I&#039;m sure this is a minority attitude, and dependent on an open trusting family relationship but maybe in years to come the parents-kids drug guidance will be just as expected as the family planning talk! It probably should be already. <br /><br />The Silk Road users are a wonderful community with an immense amount of knowledge but we are hidden. Is there a way to find our voice to educate the ignorant without jeopardizing our privacy / freedom / livelihoods? It&#039;s a Catch 22 - we need to educate those who cannot understand our culture, and explore and explain the benefits of major policy change. But being open and honest to all and sundry lines us up for unwanted attention and prosecution!&nbsp; <br /><br />SR must stay underground to survive but its revolutionary nature is fascinating to global media. Another thread speculates on whether DPR has given an interview for the next round of publicity. If so, then I imagine he had little choice - better to take the opportunity to set the record straight, than allow lies and misinformation to go unchecked. <br /><br />Like a previous poster touched on, if the whole world knows about Silk Road, but the whole world thinks its a dubious criminal enterprise of scammers and evil drug dealers flogging pills to children then we&#039;re doomed! Fear-mongering in the press will increase pressure on LE to find a way to finish us off. Dealing with the media might be unfortunate but necessary damage limitation. A measured and well argued explanation of SR&#039;s ethos may change attitudes. <br /><br />Politicians in the UK stick rigidly to their anti-drug policies for fear of losing votes. I have no doubt a pro-drug political party in the UK could garner a lot of support and publicity. Potentially it could provide an excellent platform to get the truth out. There is a whole generation with no empathy or faith in current politicians &amp; policies. The field is ripe for change. If &#039;radical&#039; policies proved popular the main parties would see an opportunity to gain votes - they would sit up and take notice, helping &#039;leftfield&#039; ideas into the mainstream arena. <br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are plenty of groups and individuals out there already working towards these aims. The international dialogue has started, and change is creeping forward. Keeping that momentum up is vital. Anyway, it&#039;s very easy to say all this, but much harder to actually do. <br /><br />

				Some people mentioned social change before, but this isn&#039;t driving the revolution. Technology is the key. The individual is being empowered like never before, and this isn&#039;t going to change. Think about your standard&nbsp; home office printer/scanner/photocopier. Ten years ago, you would have had to each device and you&#039;d be pushing $2000. Or you could buy a 3 in 1 which would cause no end of headaches. Plug and play my arse. 20 years ago - too expensive for a home office. Go to the post office or something. 30 years ago....forget it, unless you;re Gordon Gekko and willing to put up with 5 minute battery life. <br /><br />3D printing. That&#039;s where it&#039;s going to happen. It&#039;ll be affordable. It&#039;ll be easy. It&#039;ll be beyond the control of LE.

There would be a lot less money in it so organised crime would exit, coppers might be able to pinch users but the days of multi-million dollar busts in shipping containers would be well and truly over. <br /><br />In such a scenario, prosecuting the War On Drugs just wouldn&#039;t pay dividends anymore.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Can you print hookers to :) ?

				Arse I wrote a long post about 3D printers and stacked it. To recap, agreed re social change but all these factors can influence outcome and together will determine how things play out, for good or bad. <br /><br />In regards the 3D printing, presumably LE are crapping themselves already about that tech thanks to the 3D gun? On that basis, should we not assume that LE will be working on their own tech advances to monitor what goes on / combat different scenarios? If a plastic gun can slip through a body scanner, do they upgrade the entire worlds airport security systems? Or do they try to keep the product off the market as long as they can on the basis of national security. <br /><br />I guess that further down the line, when they make a cheap, small and freely available 3D printer, there will be little that LE can do to keep up. Families printing benzos off for teatime will probably be the least of their concerns. <br /><br />These days I read that the majority of benzos (just an example) on SR are fake, produced in some lab or other. Effectively a 3D printer could hand us back quality control of our drugs right? That would be cool. I can&#039;t even fathom how the process would work - presumably you&#039;d need to do a bit of chemistry first before using the printer, or would the printer do all the hard work. I know that&#039;s a somewhat impossible question to answer. Maybe we&#039;ll know in a few years time!<br /><br />
