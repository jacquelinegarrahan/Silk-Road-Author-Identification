				I am getting a free master key saw the listing and could not pass it up but now like must things i ordered i am having a moral deliumea of how or if to use it.

So I feel if you are doing no harm it is ethical so for example using open&nbsp; or cracking wifi should not be illegal but stealing someones router for your own home is. Taking drugs in&nbsp; your own home legal. Forcing someone else to take drugs without there knowlege or consent illegal. Around those terms what would be an ethical use of a master key?

				It completely depends on the context and circumstance.<br /><br />If I live on an island with 100 people, 99 of whom are starving, including myself.

I mean I have one coming to me baring the fact that it might not arrive or it might not work. Are you saying their really is no use for it that falls under my grounds of moralty should I just throw it away seems like a wast but if it keeps me out of trouble. I am just trying to find a legitimate or at least partily legitimate use for this?

				Again, it completely depends on circumstance. If someone locks you in a room against your will, then you have found a legitimate use for the key. If you end up starving and homeless and you can go and grab some bread from walmart, you&#039;ve found a legitimate use for the key (in my opinion, I&#039;m sure others including perhaps DPR would disagree with this).<br /><br />I don&#039;t really know anything about master keys and what they work on, if they work on everything etc. But I&#039;m sure you could do some awesome &#039;urban exploring&#039; with one of these.<br /><br />But if you&#039;re looking for someone to tell you &quot;stealing is okay&quot; then you really need to rethink your perspective on this. You need to decide what is right and wrong for yourself. Is there anything specific you have in mind for the key?

I know it is wrong and that is why I posted this more as a what are you using your master key for if you have ordered one off of here for.I Dont really know how the work to be honest or if they will work on anything near me IT WAS FREE!!!!!!&nbsp; &quot;Urban Exploring&quot;?&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yeah fair enough man. As I said, sometimes stealing can be okay, imo. But yeah I get ya, what is everyone else doing with theirs? I suspect others might be less concerned about ethics than yourself.<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration<br /><br />If a master key is a key that opens everything (i don&#039;t even know... is that even possible?) then this is one of the first things I&#039;d be thinking about. Illegal, but ethical and potentially awesome.

I should have simply posted the below, as a 2nd glance illuminates to me that I completely missed the mark and was reacting to something that didn&#039;t exist. I apologize. The below still stands, however, and should have been the only thing I wrote.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Now I&nbsp; know everyone defines morality differently and that is what will make this interesting.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />While this may be an accurate description, it does not mean that all moralities are equally good. Morality is concerned with the well-being of conscious life, and a &quot;well-being quotient&quot; can be reasonably understood through the facts of the cosmos. In other words, some moralities are definitely worse than others and we can say this with varying degrees of confidence. Once a person understands this simple fact they should be able to discern what is ethical and what is not, provided they have relatively normative brains. In other words, you already have a pretty good idea as to what would be ethical. Your actions may or may not be influenced by a concern with ethics, but the ethical value of these actions is what it is. If you act unethically, you have acted unethically. We must stop tricking ourselves into thinking otherwise.
