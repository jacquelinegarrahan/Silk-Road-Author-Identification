				To be honest DPR is not my hero since he did not put any solutions on the table..<br /><br />We all know its bad but what are we going to do about it?<br /><br />If keeping on writing to eachothers about how bad it is, would fix whats bad then it would not be anything bad left in this world already..<br /><br />I say everyone that does not speak of or point out the true power of btc and Sr when it comes to sharing info in the same way as drugs are shared.. Is a failed hero to me since the core of btc and Sr is not to be a part of a silly drugwar but instead ending all wars.<br /><br />Only a failed hero would be in this forum writing about how bad everything is but no futher info on what you are doing personally to detach from everything that is bad like modern slavery and the destruction of our homeplanet that will cost most of humanitys lifes..<br /><br />Writing about how bad everything is.. Is just not making you evolve since we need conclusions to be able to evolve and btc and Sr should make you all come to a conclusion just like I have.. <br /><br />Since that conclusion is that btc and Sr can be used to end wars and slavery instead of being a part of the war on drugs.. And if you are to much hero to even see that then you will probably not hear what im saying.<br /><br />Im just dropping some seeds tho and in some minds they might grow and all the sudden we have vendors providing services for infosharing on a huge scale while slaves all over the world finds out the economy is fake and it will crash while they got a chance to use their fiatmoney to spread info on a global scale thru Btc and Sr.<br /><br />Kinda ridiculus to be telling you all that the fiatmoney you got is not going to be worth anything soon when the economy crashes. So the amount of fiatmoney you stacked up is not what is important, what you used your fiatmoney for is whats important. Youre induvidually responsible for everything you do to others since karma is a universal law.<br /><br />So if you care about yourself you care about others but also realise that most of humanity will not make it since they are dumbed down beyond the slavestate of mind.. <br /><br />We are all failed heroes but at least I put a solution on the table so vendors can get to work to provide the service that enables people to pay to share info thru letters.. <br /><br />But its all up to the people, I have just told the vendors that I want the truth-sharing-services avalible..<br /><br />I got fiatmoney to spend and thats what i wanna spend their fiatmoney on, informing other fellow humans about the slaveowners that controlls the fiatcurrency.<br /><br />So now its all up to the vendors to say that they dont want the slavemaster&#039;s fiatmoney that I am willing to give them if they provide the service I was askin for.<br /><br />But they all know they are getting fuked and they can basicly hear lucifer&#039;s balls slapping against your ancles..

				Hahahahaaa I guess Im to late, like two years to late and now the feds came in and took all your money that was in SR..<br /><br />Thats the only screen im getting from visiting SR, a screen saying that the site has been removed since they controlled it and they did not like it when to much talk was going around in the forums about using Sr and Btc for good purposes instead of being a part in the war on drugsusers..<br /><br />The vendors had a few days up to a week or two to get this service provided and it would make the feds stay away from SR since if SR was used to send info instead of drugs then the war on drugs would look like a failure to the real dopedealers who promotes the war on drugs.<br /><br /><br />So the feds took all the vendors and costumers money now?<br /><br />How did they manage to get their hands on something that should be unabled to get their their hands on?<br /><br />I guess Btc was safe but SR was a part of the feds and its just another robbery done by the feds and polices..<br /><br />Since they will be using all fiatmoney then stole from you in this robbery to buy more weapons to use against you in the continual war against drugusers.<br /><br />So whats up now DPR?<br /><br />What says the hero now?<br /><br />I would say get another site running just like SR but this time lets focus on providing vendors that wanna print large amounts of letters since Btc still enables us to use money anonymously, for a while and now they shutted down SR, or should i say robbed SR.. <br /><br />I think they could smell the dangers of letting SR go on specially when people writes about ending the war on drugs using the same tools that was used for shipping drugs anonymously all over the world.. Since lets keep in mind that they keep their power by dividing humanity while they run off with the power over the people they cant controll.<br /><br /><br />Karma works kinda fast here but I guess its the beast coming now to eat you up since you fell for the lies and promises while ignoring the truth because you cant handle the truth.<br /><br /><br />Real sad folks but what can i say, I knew it was coming and you all should have known.. This is just the start on whats about to go down for the next couple of years.<br /><br />Hell on Earth for real.<br />
