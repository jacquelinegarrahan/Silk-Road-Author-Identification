				It is possible to experience a mystical state of consciousness with the use of LSD, mushrooms, and mescaline.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is a state of consciousness, characterised by a profound sense of objectivity and reality, in which all sensuous, conceptual, temporal, spatial, and empirical content is excluded, so that there remains nothing but an undifferentiated, distinctionless void of pure awareness, which is immediately recognised as a basic principle of existence. W.T. Stace, Pahnke, and other students of mysticism have distilled the following universal characteristics of mystical experience, free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations:<br /><br />- Cosmic Unity.

You can be propelled into this state with large dosages of psychedelics, or by lower dosages in combination with meditation.<br /><br />Many people, I think use psychedelics to hallucinate, and confuse hallucinations with mystical experiences. But you won&#039;t experience cosmic consciousness if this is the direction you are looking in, no matter how many times you used psychedelic drugs. <br /><br />

				Also, my problem with most people is that they say things like &quot;i&#039;ve experienced ego death many times..&quot;<br /><br />Your ego can&#039;t die.&nbsp; It&#039;s impossible.&nbsp; <br /><br />What most people WANT is realizing that there is no self to control anything.. then the real magic happens.&nbsp; no psychedelic bullshit needed for that AND it stays with you.&nbsp; people who claim their &quot;ego&quot; has died more than once are just idiots who think taking that next 10 strip is going to solve their life problems.

				i think the substance definitely matters. as said before lsd and psilocybin are good for it. phenethylamines in general lack the &quot;one with the universe&quot; aspect i get from indoles. i havent done mescaline so i cant speak on that. if anything maybe just take a break from use? nothing wrong with going a few months without tripping. its good to take from the experience, then integrate it. if your constantly dissolving your ego its not going to have the lasting effects like it normally would in my opinion.

Too much of anything is not good. Psychedelics should always be treated with respect and maybe youre just growing up. I also was a disillusioned idiot, but many of us are when we are young especially. <br />Sounds like youve come to the same realization about psychedelics as I have, I wish you the best, remember it&#039;s not the end of the world. Enjoy it for what it was.

				what you need to do is rotate the crops, like what farmers do with their fields<br /><br />if you do to much LSD and the spiritual yeild is beginin to yield, fire yourself up some DMT<br />do for a while, rotate the crops once more<br /><br />thats the beauty of Silk Road, almost every halucinagenic drug known to man(I may be wrong Im no genious) is here for your enjoyment<br /><br />that being said LSD has always been a big meany to my brain, most other halucinagens I enjoy<br /><br />so mix it up, go for the exotic stuff youv never tried before

Once you have experienced cosmic consciousness on LSD or mushrooms, it is much easier to access this state by disciplined meditation and concentration. If one is able to attain cosmic consciousness by an act of will, I don&#039;t think one needs to use psychedelic drugs for spiritual purposes,&nbsp; but these substances may still serve a useful role for other purposes.<br /><br />As for the great mystics and sages of history, many of them had spontaneous mystical experiences which they were not afterwards able to replicate. Many others evoked mystical states of consciousness by methods which are very inefficient, such as fasting, self-inflicted pain, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation,&nbsp; breath control, self-hypnosis, long hours of solitary prayer, etc. Like psychedelic drugs, these methods elicit biochemical changes and unlock the door to higher levels of consciousness. Unfortunately, these methods usually take years of practice and require the complete devotion of the individual, making social action impossible. They are also inefficient methods, similar to ingesting small dosages of psychedelics.&nbsp; I think it is better for a person to have a drug-facilitated experience of cosmic consciousness, instead of remaining withdrawn from the world until old age as a result of such ascetic practices.<br /><br />As to how do I know that what I experienced is cosmic consciousness, cosmic consciousness is really unmistakeable once you have legitimately experienced it. There is the sense of complete unity with everything in the universe, transcendence of space and time, loss of the illusion of controllership, ineffability, parodoxicality, and the other characteristics I listed above.&nbsp; I have also studied mystical literature and I find myself going through states of consciousness which correspond precisely with every description of mystical experiences that I had ever read.&nbsp; I have also experienced cosmic consciousness long before I got into drugs,&nbsp; and I find that the state of consciousness I am able to attain with LSD is identical to my previous mystical experiences.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Also, my problem with most people is that they say things like &quot;i&#039;ve experienced ego death many times..&quot;<br /><br />Your ego can&#039;t die.&nbsp; It&#039;s impossible.&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The word death in &quot;ego death&quot; is just a metaphor for transcendence. It could just as easily be called ego transcendence. The point is that the ego is no longer the whole, but is reduced to a part of a larger whole, the bodymind. It is not unusual for the individual, who hitherto saw the autonomous ego as the highest stage of unity,&nbsp; to become apprehensive about dying, to believe that he has already died, or that he now knows what death is going to be like. Hence &#039;death&#039; is a valid metaphor. Ego death also paves the way for a kind of rebirth in which feelings of annihilation are followed by a sense of reunion with the ground of being. The whole death-rebirth struggle is a very common experience in psychedelic sessions (at least in higher dosages). That&#039;s why the word &#039;ego death&#039; is used. I think it&#039;s a valid metaphor.<br /><br />Anyway, I think you raise a good point. It is quite possible for some individuals never to have a spiritual experience on LSD or mushrooms. I never experienced anything spiritual on my first 40 or so acid trips. I think this is because I was looking in the wrong direction - I was confusing aesthetic and hallucinatory experiences with spirituality. Naturally, I got frustrated when I realised that these weren&#039;t real spiritual experiences, but mere illusions. I think there is a technique to evoking a mystical state of consciousness with LSD. This is why it is important to have a competent guide who has attained higher levels of consciousness with the drug. You should also take somewhere between 200 and 400 micograms, which is much higher than the common dosage.

				if psychedelics are losing their magic, that probably means it&#039;s time for a break. doing them too often can definitely lessen the experience. you know what they say, too much of a good thing...

				I commonly hear this from psychonauts who use the same substance too frequently.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve been doing acid for the last year, you need to switch it up and do Iboga or DMT, or 2C-E... do yoga, travel, meditate, learn about tantra, etc.<br /><br />So many ways to evolve. Keep going.

				I think that everyone before using any psychedelics should learn and read a lot about it... Knowledge it&#039;s most important imo... When we r confident about it I can&#039;t imagine bad trip...

				In response to OP (I skipped over the bickering) the same thing happened to me after I started using psychedelics.&nbsp; When I first tripped on acid, I saw the beautiy in every little thing that I took for granted my whole life, I felt like I could see the would through a child&#039;s eyes.&nbsp; After I sobered up, the way I felt (enlightened/one with existance/whatever) seemed like a dream that I could only recall glimpses of.&nbsp; I took lots of psychedelics, hoping to &quot;figure out&quot; why they made me feel like that, so I wouldn&#039;t lose the feeling when the drugs ran their course - needless to say it didn&#039;t work.&nbsp; Now I have come to terms with the fact that drugs are only a tool to explore the depths of conciousness - they can&#039;t show you any &quot;truth&quot; that you aren&#039;t capable of finding on your own, but they can make it a little easier if you use them productively.&nbsp; Learn to appreciate the little things when you are sober, learn about philosopy, read books (good ones, full of knowledge), find your true self - drugs can help you to understand reality, but they are only 1 tool amoung many, don&#039;t rely on them too much - at least don&#039;t expect all the answers from them. <br /><br />tl;dr taking psychedelics lets you see things without all the preconeptions that society pounds into our brains - you can learn to see with open eyes without being on them (though you won&#039;t be giggling as much) Don&#039;t take drugs too seriously, but don&#039;t take them for granted either.<br /><br />Regarding this topic I would sugest reading a book called BE HERE NOW, by Ram Dass aka Prof. Richard Alpert

				My immediate intuition is that you aren&#039;t doing high doses sparingly.&nbsp; 75mg of DMT through a freebase vaporizer will most likely put you into contact with the &quot;Other&quot; or &quot;others&quot;.<br /><br />There are so many factors that go into the outcome of a psychedelic experience that have nothing to do with the potential of the substance.<br /><br />1) What is the exact substance/species and any information about its purity?<br />2) Size of dose.<br />3) Method of ingestion.<br />4) How often?<br />5) Any other substances in the mix?<br />6) Environment.<br />7) Mental/emotional/physical state before the trip.<br />8) Attitude and expectations for the trip.<br /><br />And a couple of qualitative points:<br />1) The substance cannot show you what you are not ready to see nor teach you what you are not ready to learn.<br />2) Observe and value the relationship you have with the substance.&nbsp; Try communicating with it if there is something wrong.

				The more psychedelics I take, the less I feel the need to take more. My original goal in using them was as a tool to be the person I wanted to be, and they&#039;ve been accomplishing that better than I had hoped so I&#039;ve noticed it&#039;s been getting longer and longer in between trips which is alright with me. :D They&#039;ve taught me quite a lot about myself and I&#039;m able to have a good time regardless of if I&#039;m high or not, only now I&#039;m able to get high regardless of the situation and still be myself. Hell, if I&#039;m able to trip on shrooms at work and actually have my employers congratulate me on doing a great job I think I&#039;m doing something right with them. The reason I bring that up is because I really believe that the experience is what you make of it, try to do something different with your time under the influence like learning a language or reading a book on consciousness or philosophy. I know for my next trip on LSD I&#039;m going to sit down and read my Dr Seuss collection to see how they&#039;ve effected my life since reading them as a child and meditate on it afterwards outside in my garden smoking weed, I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll be really pleasant. :) Do you have some grandparents alive? If so I highly recommend that you take some MDMA and stop by their place to catch up, ask them about their life and compare how much you can relate or how many differences they had growing up compared to what it was like growing up for you. Just keep moving forward and focus on living in the moment when you ever doubt yourself.

				look at people who take shitloads of psychedelics like Tim Leary and John Lily. Then come back with me and take it with pain. Hence the psychedelics.

				DMT is interesting from a scientific point of view, but I think the mental pyrotechnics of DMT are sensory, aesthetic, linguistic, and cognitive, not transcendental or spiritual.&nbsp; English mystic Alan Watts tried DMT, and considered it &quot;amusing but relatively uninteresting&quot;. I agree with the amusing part, but I still think it&#039;s highly interesting, but the interest is more akin to the interest of space exploration than that of mysticism, in my humble opinion. It&#039;s an amazing experience but quite distinct from a mystical state of consciousness. Enlightenment comes with cosmic unity; as Watts liked to say, the unity is &quot;that than which there&#039;s no whicher&quot;. You can&#039;t get any &quot;higher&quot; than that. LSD, mescaline, and mushrooms seem to be the most effective methods of evoking this state of consciousness, while DMT seems to me to be more of a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />I could be wrong about DMT. That&#039;s my impression based on only a handful of experiences with the drug, and the descriptions of it given by Terence McKenna.

				I think is all about the user. LSD helps me think about things or problems under a different perspective, under a different light. But you never stop being you, all you feel and see is something you had inside you all the time, is like it helps you tap into your subconscious. You are not going to experience things you didn&#039;t have in the beginning.
