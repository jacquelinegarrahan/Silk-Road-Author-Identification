				It just absolutely amazes me that people discovered satori without the use of chemical substances. I could never have imagined anything like that in the whole of my life..... to be free from all suffering.... to know that death is an absurdity, and everything is as it ought to be.... to know that we are all one... that there is no other soul in the universe except one&#039;s own self which is one with the Godhead. Thank you Albert Hoffman. It took me many many years of skeptical inquiry, but I am finally convinced. There is a God, and I&#039;m it.<br /><br />I couldn&#039;t find you before because you were my Me. Like looking at my eyes directly. Only the mind reflecting itself in itself can discover God. <br /><br />

				Sufism is very interesting. I think Sufism, Zen Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, etc., are all originally based on Satori-Samadhi experiences. They just offer different cultural symbols for that experience. Some religions seem to give a sharper, more coherent picture than others. But the experience to which all religions refers has a universal, and not a cultural or denominational, significance.
