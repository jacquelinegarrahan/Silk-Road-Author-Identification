				I remember reading somewhere that Rothbard had a big problem with Agorism and said it was a failure or wasn&#039;t compatible or something along those lines. I was never really too familiar with Agorism until recently, and from the simple descriptions I have read, it seems to hit the nail on the head with everything I have come to believe. As somebody who hold&#039;s Rothbard&#039;s teachings in the highest regards, what exactly was his problem with Agorism and why are they not compatible? Hopefully one of you can give me a short and sweet answer so I don&#039;t have to do anymore homework and research then I already have on my plate.&nbsp; :-\ <br /><br />-Doc

				It looks like Rothbard&#039;s critique of Agorism is related to Ronald Coarse&#039;s The Nature of the Firm.<br /><br />There is a good synopsis here: http://www.anthonyflood.com/rothbardkonkin.htm<br /><br />And konkin&#039;s rebuttal to rothbard: http://www.anthonyflood.com/konkinreplytorothbard.htm<br /><br />I&#039;m speedreading, but it appears from this that Konkin&#039;s vision of Agorism would mean everybody&#039;s an independent contractor. Rothbard sees this as absurd, we need group organization like corporations etc.<br /><br />It looks like the transaction costs argument. That some transactions are too expensive and must be internalized within units of organization called corporations instead of being all market based. <br /><br />Rothbard then says there are severe limitations to the scope of the black market being used for freedom (Konkin&#039;s argument), because practical stuff like making cars, concrete factories have no reason to be black market economy stuff. Essentially he accuses Konkin of overly focusing on exotic elements e.g. illegal drugs rather than the more mundane production necessary for the world.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I think it would be very interesting to know what Rothbard and Konkin would think about cryptocurrencies! It is possible Rothbard is completely correct in 1980 and completely wrong in 2020!<br /><br />Must add: I find left wing libertarians seriously confusing animals. I don&#039;t see what&#039;s left wing about them exactly. They seem to think being against American policies is somehow an automatic left wing position, but markets and/or private ownership is ok. As far as I&#039;m concerned meritocracy and egalitarianism are exact opposites. Somebody explain to me how these dudes live with themselves, they seem neither fish nor fowl to me.<br />

				Thanks for finding these Pine.&nbsp; Rothbard and Konkin were the two main inspirations for creating Silk Road, so it is interesting to see that they disagreed on some things.&nbsp; They both have the same ends: abolition of the state.&nbsp; However, they disagree on what the best path to get there is, and what the world will look like if&nbsp; we do.&nbsp; Regarding how labor will organize absent government controls, as I&#039;ve mentioned in other posts, no one really knows, but I tend to side with Rothbard on this one, that organizations of different sizes would be optimal and have their place along side sole-proprietorships.&nbsp; Konkin cedes this point as unimportant in his reply anyway.<br /><br />The main difference I see in these essays is the means that should be pursued to bring about a free society.&nbsp; Konkin advocates agorism, while Rothbard advocates political action.&nbsp; In this case, I think Rothbard is out of touch with business, markets and the messy power struggle of the real world.&nbsp; He&#039;s an amazing economist, political scientist, and historian, but he&#039;s not a businessman or entrepreneur.&nbsp; Konkin is no where near the academic that Rothbard is, but his genius lies in his simple insights he called agorism and counter-economics.&nbsp; He saw that society is simply the aggregate of the billions of human to human interactions that go on daily and that the power of the state is derived from their control of those interactions.&nbsp; The more they control, the more powerful they are, the less they control, the less powerful they are and the more freedom individuals have.&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; So, if you want to be free and remove your support from the state, stop engaging in interactions that they control as much as possible.<br /><br />Honestly I see no major problem with either approach that would make it unworthy of pursuit.&nbsp; Electing officials that will take steps to dismantle the state apparatus and give people more freedom is great.&nbsp; Break up and weaken that monopoly from the inside.&nbsp; At the same time, actively creating alternatives to it in the free market and making it easier for people to withdraw their support is also great, weaken it from the outside.<br /><br />Both have their pitfalls and drawbacks, and liberty is still only a dream we can work toward but may never obtain, but I hope that if these men were still alive and saw Silk Road, they would have hope for the future and agree that their views are compatible.

				Thank you both for the help in teaching me something.&nbsp; :)<br /><br />I too wonder what some of the great libertarian minds of the past would say if they saw all this. I assume they would be filled with the same overwhelming delight I was when I stumbled upon this amazing place. The black market is the only thing supplying the demand for a free market as of right now, and thanks to bitcoin I suppose that almost any industry could participate outside of state control. Take Wikispeed for example, the first car manufacturer to accept bitcoins as payment for automobiles that they build from scratch. If they could manage to pull that off anonymously, then they could operate solely in the black market. It seems that with the right technology maybe we can all be independent contractors after all. It makes my head spin thinking about what the world will look like in the next 10 or 20 years. <br /><br />As far as the so called &quot;libertarian socialists&quot;, if such an oxymoron is even possible, I am even more confused than you are. Their attempts to make life &quot;equal&quot; for everyone leave no motivation for those who come up with the good ideas. If they want to start a business and hire unqualified and incompetent people to run the show then by all means let them, but there&#039;s no way to give equality to everyone without using force and coercion to steal money.

Now keep in mind I have not read ANY thing by Rothbard&nbsp; (recommendations? :D Man, Economy &amp; the State?) or The New Libertarian Manifesto <br />I try to be an agorist whenever I can, (avoid taxes when it is plausible that I will not get audited for it) but I feel there is a tradeoff with agorists in that. you keep your integrity and money, but you have a higher chance of being hunted down by the state.<br /><br />So I don&#039;t know, when I do a contract job, I don&#039;t pay the taxes, (unless it was my major source of income), I always opt to be paid in cash when it is available. Is this agorism? or because I do not commit to it 100% of the time it is some sort of pseudo-agorism? some insight in this would interesting. <br /><br />Freedom psychologically takes priority over economic freedom for me.

So actually you&#039;d be converting run-of-the-mill countereconomists (which, yes, to some extent includes EVERYONE who lives under a state) into agorists. I know a lot of people (especially the Free Talk Live crew) are critical of people who stick to their guns on definitions like that, but what was the point of Konkin coming up with a word to distinguish consciously revolutionary countereconomics if it is to be conflated with countereconomics in general? Agorism is, at its heart, a theory of revolutionary strategy, not of ethics or economics; although a revolution must have an ethical goal, and economics explains why Agorism can work.

				As I have told many others, Rothbard and the rest of the Mises gang while being incredibly intelligent are not the be all end all of the anarchist world. <br /><br />I am an anarchist who follows the non aggression principle. <br /><br />Everything else, is chicken feed and doesnt mean a damn thing to me personally. I love bitcoin, hard silver, copper, gold and barter. In my local area we have several satisfying markets that are grey in nature, avoidance of the state is of primary concern. <br /><br />Regardless, my hat is off to those who have worked so hard on this wonderful avenue of true liberty.

				I&#039;ve started to read Rothbard but it&#039;s a real struggle.&nbsp; Couple of dozen pages in, and he&#039;s trying to argue about &#039;natural order&#039;.&nbsp; Which natural order?&nbsp; Back when we weren&#039;t top of the food chain, or before we started eating grains?&nbsp; What knowledge or basis do you have to comment on what is &#039;natural&#039; regarding the behaviour of the human species?&nbsp; Perhaps the entire world, the way the world currently sits, is the most natural system never be be devised?<br /><br />The other real big issue I have with American style libertarianism, is that it comes with historical baggage.&nbsp; The original zeitgeist of the US was one of escape from they tyranny of the British Empire, into new and unexplored lands. &quot;Every man for himself!&quot; I&#039;m sure was utmost in the minds of many.&nbsp; The great irony is of course 300 years later and the US is in fact the new Empire - nothing has changed.<br />Because of this historical baggage, it appears many US libertarians cannot reconcile the natural human proclivity for power with the the need for an advanced society to have an underlying structure over and above &#039;survival of the fittest&#039;.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost to the point where if you believe that in order for society to function requires rules, you&#039;re automatically advocating the state and therefore can&#039;t be a libertarian.&nbsp; And by rules I don&#039;t mean &#039;freedom above all&#039;, I mean an agreed structure in which people can live and prosper.<br /><br />If you think a platform of &#039;freedom&#039; will solve the world&#039;s ills, I think that&#039;s an incredibly naive thing to think.&nbsp; Without some framework, human nature (we&#039;re back to the first paragraph again) I believe would have a propensity towards chaos and you&#039;re back to square one again - the power struggle.<br /><br />And this is the thing I struggle with the most - if it&#039;s human nature to destroy itself and everything else - and I think that&#039;s not a difficult road to argue, historically - then how is libertarianism going to respond to that, if it is indeed the true &#039;human nature&#039;?<br /><br />I think

				Both were market anarchists. What voluntary relationships will evolve from pure market anarchy is open for debate. A relationship that works well in one industry, might not work well in another. The most important thing is, ALL economic relationships are voluntary and open to market forces. The market ultimately decides the organizational components of business. <br /><br />I think Karl Hess brings it into perspective with, &quot;Anarchy Without Hyphens&quot;. <br /><br /><br />http://www.panarchy.org/hess/anarchism.html

Now back up the lulz and answer it, who will build the roads? Are you stipulating that automagically landowners big and small will somehow each build a section of road on their land that just so happens to be compatible with neighboring sections of like-minded landowners? And since the market is all about profit, how is that going to work? A toll booth every 50 yards?<br /><br />You can belittle the question all you want, as long as you don&#039;t have an evidence-based answer, or at least a falsifiable model, those giggles are more like the giggling of a teenage girl trying to evade an embarrassing question.
