				http://www.cornucopia.org/2013/01/action-alert-genetically-engineered-salmon/<br />--copy pasted for you---<br /><br />FDA Seeks Public Comment<br />Comments due February 25, 2013<br />&nbsp;<br />FDA poised to approve genetically engineered salmon despite unknown risks to human health.<br />Inevitable accidental release of transgenic fish into the wild could devastate native fish populations and ecosystems!<br /><br />---image---<br />The DNA of the top fish has been genetically engineered to produce growth hormones all the time for its entire life. People who eat this fish will be eating this DNA, along with the growth hormones.<br />&nbsp;<br />Despite overwhelming opposition from citizens and public interest groups to genetically engineered (GE) food, including 400,000 public comments opposing GE salmon, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced December 26, 2012 that it is prepared to give transgenic salmon its final stamp of approval.<br />&nbsp;<br />The FDA failed to address serious concerns about the safety of consuming salmon that has been genetically engineered to produce growth hormones at all times, allowing it to grow faster and bigger than natural salmon. The FDA has not conducted any safety testing, and merely assumes that the genetically engineered salmon is safe to eat.<br />&nbsp;<br />The FDA has also not considered the potential ecological and economic impacts of approving genetically engineered salmon. Salmon is an integral part of the ecosystem, and the accidental escape of genetically engineered salmon could devastate populations of native salmon, as well as the fish and marine mammals that depend on salmon for their food. Scientists have predicted that escaped GE salmon would likely wipe out wild salmon populations, which will destroy the livelihood of coastal communities that depend on fishing.<br />&nbsp;<br />Despite the fact that the vast majority of Americans do not want to eat genetically modified organisms, this salmon will not be labeled as such. Yet the Obama administration is willing to gamble with our health for the financial benefit of one biotechnology company.<br />&nbsp;<br />US citizens have the opportunity to comment to the FDA, expressing support or opposition to genetically engineered salmon.<br />&nbsp;<br />Full Instructions for Submitting Public Comment:<br />&nbsp;<br />To submit your comment electronically:<br />&nbsp;http://www.regulations.gov/#!submitComment;D=FDA-2011-N-0899-0001<br />&nbsp;<br />For the required field “Organization Name,” please enter “Citizen.”<br />&nbsp;<br />To mail your comment:<br />&nbsp;Division of Dockets Management (HFA- 305)<br />&nbsp;Food and Drug Administration<br />&nbsp;5630 Fishers Lane, Rm. 1061<br />&nbsp;Rockville, MD 20852<br />&nbsp;<br />Include the following docket number in your mailed comment: FDA-2011-N-0899<br />&nbsp;<br />Comments must be received by the FDA no later than February 25, 2013.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sample Letter<br />&nbsp;(Please note that your personalization of this sample letter will increase its impact)<br />&nbsp;<br />To the FDA:<br />&nbsp;<br />Please do not approve genetically engineered salmon. The health risks of consuming salmon that has been genetically altered to produce growth hormones at all times are unknown. Your claim that genetically engineered salmon is safe to eat is based on an assumption, not on rigorous scientific investigation.<br />&nbsp;<br />The accidental release of transgenic salmon could be devastating to marine ecosystems and wild salmon populations. It is naïve to assume that no transgenic fish will escape into the wild. The National Academy of Sciences wrote that release of transgenic fish is “of immediate concern” and “might pose environmental hazards.” These impacts would likely be irreversible.<br />&nbsp;<br />I urge you to put human health, the environment, and the economic well-being of coastal fishing communities first. The FDA should rely on independent and credible science, not on science supplied by the corporation that stands to profit from your approval.<br />&nbsp;<br />Please delay approval of genetically engineered salmon until the results of independent scientific studies show that genetically engineered fish is safe to eat and harmless to the environment.<br />&nbsp;<br />Please also require the labeling of GE foods, to allow consumers to make an informed choice.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sincerely,<br />&nbsp;<br />[Your Name]<br />&nbsp;<br />Additional Action<br />&nbsp;If you would like to do more, please contact your legislators, asking them to block the approval of GE salmon.<br />&nbsp;<br />To find contact information for your representative and two senators:<br /><br /><br />House of Representatives http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/<br /><br />Senate http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm<br />

				I fear you may be fighting a losing battle.&nbsp; BIG Corporations with unlimited funds to pull from have the upper hand.&nbsp; I stopped eating all fish after reading about how most of the fish that I would get to eat at a restaurant was farmed fish.&nbsp; Also most of the salmon they serve at restaurants has been died to give it a more pink appearance....&nbsp; What is Americans fucking deal with caring about what color your food is?&nbsp; &nbsp;Taste, texture and health factor is what really matters.<br /><br />I used to enjoy a good salmon filet, but its really hard to these days knowing that the fish I am about to eat is pretty far from &quot;natural&quot;

In my opinion is close whether the monetary debt or this environmental debt is the worse prize for future generations. I mean really we are going to look stupid to them

I recently wrote a research paper for a humanities class discussing how science fiction can teach us lessons on developing technologies and how to avoid disasters. Genetic engineering is a relatively recent area, and I would want to see long term experiments done with these salmon to see how they affect their environment before a decision is made. <br /><br />That being said, I do believe that the solution to many issues in the world is genetic engineering. Microbes that excrete fuel, food with enormous yields and resistance to diseases, etc. There is a lot of good that could be done in the world with genetically modified organisms but also a lot of harm, either deliberately or accidentally.

				What a sad state of affairs....think&nbsp; Food Inc and Monsanto&#039;s disheveled soybean .&nbsp; GMO Salmon with a patent ? Let&#039;s hope not.This would be impossible to reverse once implemented&nbsp; Wild Alaskan Salmon is&nbsp; a&nbsp; Superfood,&nbsp; &nbsp;loaded with DHA/EPA and astaxanthin. I buy tins of the stuff none of that farmed crap from Tasmania or Norway. <br /><br />Case in Point ..Google Monsanto GM Corn and Cancer in Rats..

				I will definitely be sending a comment. As my life revolves around the culinary world I feel obligated to sell my customers the healthiest and more nutritious foods possible. This will send bad vibes my way that I must transfer into positive energy. We will bring down the corporations. It&#039;s fighting the system like with SR that gives us hope.

				The whole point of GMO is to control the food supply.&nbsp; It&#039;s not about feeding people, GMO monocultures of crops and food supply is destined to fail because there is no genetic variation; there is no greater genetic modifier than nature itself.. At the end of the day, it&#039;s war on the people, for total control of the population.&nbsp; &nbsp;Modifying genes with unknown variants is a cancer on whatever is modified.&nbsp; <br /><br />There GMO is a gender bender too...&nbsp; I don&#039;t want my sons growing tits, its happening and has happened everywhere in the usa now.&nbsp; And truth be told, anyone who invested in a lifetime of eating gmo has already been altered in some way.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Organic farming can only produce enough food on its own to sustain about two-thirds of the global population. We would have to kill off over two billion people worldwide if we wanted to permanently end all non-organic farming methods.&nbsp; <br />Are you willing to tell these people that they don&#039;t deserve to eat even though there&#039;s no scientific evidence at this time that demonstrates increased heath risks from eating GMO?<br /><br />This is the current statement from the AAAS on GMO foods:<br /><br />&quot;Moreover, the AAAS Board said, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the British Royal Society, and “every other respected organization that has examined the evidence has come to the same conclusion: consuming foods containing ingredients derived from GM crops is no riskier than consuming the same foods containing ingredients from crop plants modified by conventional plant improvement techniques.”<br /><br />I&#039;m not drawing any conclusions about the long term risks of eating GMO salmon. I just think the cautious and rational approach at this time would be to properly label it so people have a choice as to what they consume. For instance, almost all corn and corn-products sold now are GM&#039;d and unlabeled. 70% of processed foods in this country have GMOs in them. Unless you prepare everything at home, you&#039;re likely eating GMOs every day.<br /><br />IMO that&#039;s fucked up.

I&#039;m not your enemy and I&#039;m not disagreeing with you that more long term independent research should be conducted. I&#039;m just agnostic about harmful affects of eating GMO salmon until a link can be established.&nbsp; :-\

				A.<br />Two of those were due to human error, not technical. Chernobyl was the result of a technician deciding to run a test and overriding several safety protocols, Fukushima was actually not a nuclear containment related failure (and why would anyone in their right mind put a nuke plant in a natural disaster prone area in the first place?), and Three Mile Island is the only one where the issue was solely and specifically the design of the cooling system (which is still technically human error for improperly design). Also, I believe the net damage caused by nuclear power is actually less than the net damage caused by accidents related to the use of fossil fuels, they have just been publicized and dramatized a LOT more, because &quot;science gone rogue&quot; gets ratings. I wrote a paper that touched on that topic last year. I do agree that more impartial studies need to be done into the GM products being released, but most of the uproar is just media dramatization. In the US (I am assuming that is the country you are referring to), as of 2008 it is only 20% of the power generation capacity of the US. Also, the nuclear program has gone for quite some time with a cut in funding and has only recently seen an increase in federal support. Globally, the interest in nuclear power has been and is down precisely because of the media demonizing it. <br /><br />B.<br />Also, right now we do not have enough food production to sustain the whole world, and not in the areas it is most needed, such as large parts of Africa. The biofuels boom is also taking up large amounts of corn that would otherwise be used as fuel. <br /><br />C.<br />If corn A and corn B share the exact same characteristics except that B happens to have a natural immunity to a certain disease that is not caused by the production of any toxic chemicals, please tell me which part of B is going to cause the damage and how.<br /><br />D.<br />The only effects that would be different from non-GM would be those caused by modified parts of the organism. If those parts do not cause the addition of any other chemicals to the final, processed and ready to eat food, then what effects could they possibly have? If making the corn resistant to disease meant that all food made with that corn would contain several grams of cyanide, then yes that would be bad. But it does not. Again, which parts specifically are going to cause this damage?<br /><br />E.<br />That sounded a bit technophobic. If you could provide a link to a reputable study done that conclusively proves sterility is caused by commercially available GM food that would be nice. Also, one of the main objectives of GM food is I believe to abolish the need for pesticides...so I do not really see how those two are going to work together to destroy all life. The terminator seeds are something I disagree with, but that is due only to my personal beliefs regarding freedom of information and the copyright monopoly.

But I find your claim to be highly suspect. The best example of GMO I know of follows this pattern: invent a highly effective pesticide, oh noez it kills the plant as well, genetically modify the plant to resist the pesticide, now you can use highly effective pesticide without killing the crop. This means that the genetically modified crop is able to be used concurrently with a highly effective pesticide, the organic crop that hasn&#039;t been genetically modified cannot be used with that pesticide because it will kill it, and due to using less effective pesticides the natural organic crop is going to get eaten by pests. This means that by using the genetically engineered crop, you can produce more food. Now when everybody starts using this genetically modified crop, there is going to be a significant increase in the amount of food available, and starvation is going to go down and food prices are going to go down due to supply and demand economics. <br /><br />Now I do know that the genetic engineering corporations do lock farmers into needing to purchase seeds from them for every cycle, and that is more a debate regarding property rights than it is a debate about the benefits of genetically modified foods. <br /><br />Also, genetic engineering does mimic human controlled selection, in my view it is like an increased speed natural selection. Instead of the farmers using the pesticide on the &#039;organic&#039; crops and having them all die save for a few, and then breeding the few survivors, for many cycles until they coerce the crops to be naturally resistant to the pesticide, they cut to the chase with genetic engineering. <br /><br />Also it is not just creating plants that are immune to certain effective pesticides, they also engineer them to produce more. And again it is just enhanced natural selection, rather than getting the end result of higher yields by the farmers interfering with natural selection in an attempt to coerce certain desirable properties over many generations, they directly interfere with the genetics of the plant or of the salmon or whatever to get the desired result immediately and precisely.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">You, sir, are a fucking idiot.&nbsp; Ignorance like this and widespread corruption is the reason companies like Monsanto continue to taint all of our seedbanks and ruin all of our food.&nbsp; Natural selection is NOT genetic engineering.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Human controlled selection is indeed genetic engineering, it just isn&#039;t the most efficient route. If I have a population of organisms and I select which ones are allowed to breed based on characteristics I find desirable, I am in effect changing the genetic make up of future generations of the organism to be more similar to what I desire. This is a time consuming process though, and it is more efficient and precise if I directly genetically modify the organisms to be how I desire, rather than try to indirectly change their genetic makeup via controlling the mating / reproduction.<br /><br />

				If they were modifying the plants to actually yield more or grow in climates that are not normally able to produce crop, I have no problem with that. But that is not the case (I am specifically speaking of roundup herbicide). The first year yields of roundup crops are indeed a small percentage higher than the average on non roundup crops. The difference is that the roundup crop yields get lower every year to the point where they are producing consistently lower yields than farms that remained organic. Couple that with the fact that non-monsanto crops will no longer grow in a field where roundup was used for nearly a decade and you have recipe for LESS food.<br /><br />Monsanto techs are geniuses with their genetics, and I don&#039;t disagree with using genetics to produce more food. I don&#039;t think that GMO&#039;s cause cancer any more than cool breeze does.<br /><br />But the thing I don&#039;t understand about the geniuses making these crops is why they tabled the 2007 project that produced drought resistant corn. The project was to create a plant that could grow in arid climates, and it fucking worked. There was an indoor test plot that produced a crop of corn with absolutely ZERO moisture after germination. Granted the crop was not high yielding, but with zero precipitation you can&#039;t expect bumper crops. This project was tabled after the first test that actually worked. Turns out, the areas that this crop would be grown don&#039;t have pest or weed issues, so they didn&#039;t stand to profit from any massive chemical requirements. So they could have been crowing corn in near desert conditions without irrigation, but instead, they opted to come out with more aggressive herbicides and more expensive genetics for the areas that are already producing crops and could have handled their weed problems with larger, more accurate, and more efficient equipment.<br /><br />And I guess I&#039;ll just throw out their sweet potato blunder also. That GMO tuber was supposed to help bring parts of Africa out of the third world, but instead pushed them further into famine. <br /><br />So my point is that GMO is not the devil if it is used to produce more food. The industry seems to be set on producing the same or lower crops while lining their pockets and writing their own laws and testing standards for safety. I think they could make the same profits (or more) if they used their genetic engineering capabilities to actually fix the problem instead of perpetuate it.<br /><br />I will be thoroughly impressed though when they engineer a new grain or vegetable. selective breeding brought us broccoli, Monsanto has brought us chemical resistant weeds. I use broccoli as my example because I really like broccoli. <br /><br /><br />
