				Title: <strong>The Badge</strong><br />

				I was arrested by an undercover cop years ago. After he threw me to the ground and pinned his knee in my chest, he shoved his badge in my face. I&#039;ll never forget it. That shiny little emblem of Babylon is what gave that pig the authority to use force against me. <br /><br />The badge. Its just a symbol. But its also so much more.<br /><br />It represents (theoretically) the will of the people, as a whole, to keep our society &quot;safe&quot;. But somewhere along the way, its meaning and purpose became corrupted and perverted. In actuallity, it represents the will of those in power, not that of humanity as a whole.<br /><br />The badge is just another instrument of Babylon&#039;s mind-fuck. They mind-fuck the wearer into thinking his actions are righteous and just. More importantly, they mind-fuck the public into thinking those that wear a badge have authority over them. Without that badge, that pig is just an ordinary citizen. <br /><br />As Timothy Leary once said, &quot;Think for yourself, and question authority&quot;. Fuck authority. And fuck the badge that magically grants it. Fuck the police!<br />

				I remember a quote from who knows who: &quot;A lot of people respect the badge. The rest respect the gun.&quot;<br /><br />Today I think &quot;respect&quot; should be exchanged for &quot;fear&quot;. Fear rules all tyrannies.

				We are all criminals, especially those sworn to protect criminals from criminals.<br /><br />It&#039;s a matter of severity, how often you announce it, and when you slip up that determines when - or if - you are &quot;caught.&quot; I say if, because some can go til their last day without ever being arrested, but they sure broke the law in their time, in some form or another.
