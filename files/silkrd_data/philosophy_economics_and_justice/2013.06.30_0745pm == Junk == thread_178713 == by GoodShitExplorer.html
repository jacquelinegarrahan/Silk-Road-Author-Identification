				I think I agree with you. All of us are part of God. But our spirit (energy) is capsulated in our bodies, makes us separated from each other. When we are released from these bodies, we might return to our source (God).

I guess brahman just seems like a likely cantidate. but I dont see why brahman and yewah have to be different entities in any way but name and personification. in the end it wont really matter- just be a cool dude . if theres a god willing to damn me when I tried to be a good person, just because i failed to say the right prayers , that gods a dick and probably was going to damn me anyways.

				If you have been raised as Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu or any other religion, you really should be allowed to question that religion.<br /><br />Sadly, we have a situation in which we are told to have great respect for any religion, a premise that I for one don&#039;t buy. <br /><br />I judge people by how they treat others. And sure, having a moral code of sorts helps. I guess I agree with the &#039;don&#039;t kill&#039; and &#039;don&#039;t cheat on your wife/husband&#039; but I find some religions to have harsh and unfair rules, in particular women get a bad deal - and children get no choice. They are told that this god or that god rules us all. Its usually a bunch of old men who &#039;interpret&#039; what this god wants. Some even say god talks to them. But, as we all know, the mental homes of the world are host to lots of gods or prophets who swear they are some special being. So far none have turned water to wine or floated in the air or something really miraclous.<br /><br />It all comes down to two truths.<br /><br />One truth is that we are just an accident which has led us to become sentient beings with a sense of self awareness. Some radiation, some gases, some chemicals, alkaline and acids and some scientists say that we evolved from a primeval &#039;soup&#039; a bubbling mass of stuff that eventually led to one cell living things that eventually became us.<br /><br />The other truth is that we were created. We call the creator &#039;god&#039; because that can mean anything really. It is likely that if there is a god then that god would send messangers to the world. Could be some distant planet which is humanoid and evolved to the point they have no wars, no hate or envy. They must surely think we are fucked up. I would say that ALL religions have the hand of man at play. Even if some prophet did come along - men would surely use them for their own reasons. The Romans adopted Christianity when they saw that the followers were not scared of death. Same for the Muslims, some Arab warrior saw the same lack of fear over death and thought they would make good soliders and so he adopted the religion of Islam.<br /><br />The Jewish religion, read the Old Testament and its a bloodbath as are some of the Muslim &#039;Hadiths&#039; (stories of Mohammed) <br /><br />Buddhists seem pretty peaceful, but they will pick up a big stick if provoked.<br /><br />Religion and politics are often one and the same thing.<br /><br />By the way, I&#039;m a prophet also - so send your btc and I&#039;ll turn your water into buds.<br /><br />&nbsp;;)<br /><br />May your God, go with you. And always question your religion that you were raised with. <br /><br />I pop into any religious building myself - churches, mosques, temples and synagougues. <br /><br />My main place of worhsip is the countryside - nature - looking up at the stars and feeling the good earth beneath me. Add some shrooms to that and maybe you can see how humans got to thinking about why were are here and what this life is all about!<br /><br />I got a Jewish buddy and a Muslim one - plus Christians as that is what I was raised as.<br /><br />Lovely people - never judge people until you know them a little. And never judge a whole race or culture of people! Thats what Hitler did. Daft bastard. <br /><br />So, peace be with you all!<br /><br />PS - live life - don&#039;t keep refering to the rules set by others. But don&#039;t kill people, don&#039;t rob them, don&#039;t bully anyone and enjoy life. We all have a conscience. Well, most of us. Guess Ted Bundy never had one or ignored it and fucked up big time. Apologies if that seems a bit offhand - what he done was wicked and evil.

				I have this conversation with a lot of friends, well the ones that aren&#039;t too shy to talk about it. <br /><br />This is how I see it...<br /><br />1. There is a higher being, has to be... Too many amazingly spectacular life forms, settings, extraordinary things like the people of SR for example that in order to exist, must have had someone create them. That&#039;s my view. <br />2. That being is EVERYTHING. He&#039;s you, he&#039;s me, he&#039;s a line of coke, it is a snake, it is the sexiest woman you have ever seen and the dirtiest crack whore to ever suck in a red light district. It&#039;s literally everything. <br />3. You don&#039;t have to study a bible or piece of literature to be accepted by this being. You don&#039;t need to religiously attend church for instruction....<br />Some children never have heard the word &quot;Jesus&quot; &quot;Buddha&quot; or &quot;Mohammad&quot;. How can these children be cast into &quot;hell&quot; for not doing something they never even had heard of? You can&#039;t, well not morally.<br />4. Live your life with good vibes, a well being, showing love to others, giving, and truly caring. This won&#039;t get you very far in life per say, but in the off chance that the biggest argument in the history of the world (God vs No God) has a winner, which it will... &amp; that winner is &quot;God&quot; instead of &quot;no god&quot; you should be sitting pretty if you live a fairly moral lifestyle. Not by going to church every week or praying every minute.

				I could jump into this tired discussion of a god vs no god, but I feel I have little to contribute by answering that question directly. I believe simply that the idea of the supernatural was invented and constructed. Not willfully, but by misunderstanding of the world. For example, a person takes DMT and reports in a documentary (called &quot;The Spirit Molecule&quot;) that they had a spiritual experience. This isn&#039;t verifiable evidence that they have a spirit, and when they believe they are connected to a higher being, that only occurs through their use of the drug. We of course know now that although the brain is complex, we can measure and verify that drugs inhibit or induce certain receptors in our brain to function a particular way based on neurons and hormones. Neuroscience is a fascinating field when one looks at humans as though we are complicated bags of chemicals and not mystical vessels of an unseen and untouchable soul.<br /><br />But the most important thing I feel I may be able to communicate to many of you, is something I hope you have discovered in your experience before anyone has had to say it. <br /><br />You don&#039;t have to know what you believe right away, but know why you believe. That will help you decide what you believe.

Add some shrooms to that and maybe you can see how humans got to thinking about why were are here and what this life is all about!<br /><br />I got a Jewish buddy and a Muslim one - plus Christians as that is what I was raised as.<br /><br />Lovely people - never judge people until you know them a little. And never judge a whole race or culture of people! Thats what Hitler did. Daft bastard. <br /><br />So, peace be with you all!<br /><br />PS - live life - don&#039;t keep refering to the rules set by others. But don&#039;t kill people, don&#039;t rob them, don&#039;t bully anyone and enjoy life. We all have a conscience. Well, most of us. Guess Ted Bundy never had one or ignored it and fucked up big time. Apologies if that seems a bit offhand - what he done was wicked and evil.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>
