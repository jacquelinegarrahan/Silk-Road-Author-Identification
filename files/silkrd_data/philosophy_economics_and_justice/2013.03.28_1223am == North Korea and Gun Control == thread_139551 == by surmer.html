				How perfect is the fabrication of New Town? Nightly news giving a narrative for the families and law enforcement involved in the calamity that occurred under the label of mental health. It is so dramatic that Americans have been fooled into believing Arms Control is the answer. North Korea is the vanguard of China’s hostile invasion.<br /><br />How long ago was it that whistleblowers revealed China’s military hacking? Then an article not long after that first alarm bell: Chinese computer hackers are unhappy employees. A glimpse of deception that persists via foreign influences. Media Comm is global. Who’s tracking global currency? Writing? Ideas?<br /><br />War has already begun. Now North Korea is taking the step past physical barriers: military mobility.

				US Troops are already there in a way, they are in South Korea and have been. The US govt will use ANY excuse to spend more $ and spill more blood, we are a country continuously at war for profit. The dark side also gets off on death and suffering, that is why there is so much of it in the world, the money interests prove the dark side feeds off of it, because they have the resources to change some of the wrongs, they choose not to.

				In some ways, albeit from tragic events in recent American history regarding firearms and domestic arms control, the race to own assault weapons has generated secondary effects for self-protection and self-preservation. Of course there are troops present in South Korea and throughout the Pacific. Avoiding nuclear options are worth losing a few men due to military aggression, but the bigger strategic interest is whether or now China will get caught supporting North Korea... God, I hope there is peace, for the sake of modern civilizations. Enough nuclear and conventional warfare involving China and the West could do as much damage as burning the Libraries of Alexandria.

				No, maple, I don&#039;t think it would go global, but war is never predictable. It&#039;s like the BTC. No one knows the outcome until it happens. There are always a few people that guess it right, but unless they are the decision-makers, outcomes are rarely known. Even with decision-makers, the next few steps are still unpredictable.<br /><br />For the sake of human civilization, I hope that we don&#039;t fight North Korea. I hope that we don&#039;t get caught spying on them as we did in the Tonkin Sea, as in the case of Vietnam. However, the intelligence of the US public will not be enough to match that of the war machine. The Iraq War, although a critical step the Arab Spring (it doesn&#039;t take much to get them going... as every other generation is a war-torn and battle-hardened bunch), was a hoax in terms of its actual premise... This is where it gets very fuzzy. CIA fuzzy.<br /><br />Democracy in the Middle East? Instead of US-chosen dictators? Jesus, that would be beautiful. Independent and culturally revolutionary Middle East, educated and proud. Instead, we have Iran; Syria is in upheaval. Egypt has fallen off the radar as far as Prime Time goes, replaced by gun violence. Gun Violence? Is it the GMOs? Autism is 1 in 10, now? 1 in 4?<br /><br />Anyway, I hope we don&#039;t go to war. Everyone has nukes. Everyone has everything to lose. We just need to infiltrate and educate the people of North Korea.

I hope that we don&#039;t get caught spying on them as we did in the Tonkin Sea, as in the case of Vietnam. However, the intelligence of the US public will not be enough to match that of the war machine. The Iraq War, although a critical step the Arab Spring (it doesn&#039;t take much to get them going... as every other generation is a war-torn and battle-hardened bunch), was a hoax in terms of its actual premise... This is where it gets very fuzzy. CIA fuzzy.<br /><br />Democracy in the Middle East? Instead of US-chosen dictators? Jesus, that would be beautiful. Independent and culturally revolutionary Middle East, educated and proud. Instead, we have Iran; Syria is in upheaval. Egypt has fallen off the radar as far as Prime Time goes, replaced by gun violence. Gun Violence? Is it the GMOs? Autism is 1 in 10, now? 1 in 4?<br /><br />Anyway, I hope we don&#039;t go to war. Everyone has nukes. Everyone has everything to lose. We just need to infiltrate and educate the people of North Korea.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree. CIA and the whole Middle Eastern crisis is a much more difficult subject that I rather not get into, but could go on for days about. But tensions are running high and it&#039;s about to get REAL ugly.

				I think world war breaking out just isn&#039;t realistic. North Korea can talk a big show, and they like to act like they have a ton of power, but they would lose any hope of allying with China if they declared war on the US because of their troops in South Korea. As for Russia, they too would lose a lot by going against the United States, and their leaders know it. I&#039;m not saying the United States is invincible or something, but as other people have said we love to spend money on &quot;defense&quot; something like 17% of all collected tax money goes to defense, more than the top 7 spenders in the world combined.

I do not think they will stop until they are stopped, and if they manage to start implementing Orwellian policies it could get really difficult fast. I remember the end of Orwells 1984, and it was pretty damn depressing. I mean, I doubt it will get THAT bad before people start to fight back, but quite a few of the measures that might initially be supported by some members of the public would be instrumental in limiting the effectiveness of any sort of revolution, such as CCTV or internet censorship acts. I don&#039;t think any sort of open physical revolt will prove effective in the end. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=139551.msg960607#msg960607">Quote from: Poisonouss on March 31, 2013, 04:16 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think world war breaking out just isn&#039;t realistic.

The NK people have been isolated. They need to be freed, so that they can share the global human enterprise.<br /><br />E.U., NAFTA., O.P.E.C., U.N., ....<br /><br />We need to &quot;infiltrate&quot; the NK people, so that they don&#039;t mimic the fictional Unsullied from Game of Thrones. This requires a tremendous amount of resources, but the outcome could be the absence of nuclear fallout--which the WORLD WILL SUFFER. Radioactive xenon gas... other radioactive isotopes: Iodine (do you have potassium iodide stockpiles?)... Volcanic activity is even possible just beyond North Korean borders in China. The volcanic lake there has raised due to an exacerbated magma chamber below.... thanks to the 3 or 4 magnitude nuclear-induced earthquake (Xenon was detected, proving the detonation of a nuclear weapon)....<br /><br />Parenthetically, the U.S. media seems resolute for North Korean incompetence, claiming they do not have I.C.B.M technology reliable enough to reach the U.S., much less be accurate. Truth be told, no one knows every secret! We don&#039;t want to be crying over a 9/11 times 1,000, do we? No...<br /><br />So, thermodynamically, what does it take to prevent a nuclear holocaust? How many resources are we willing to dedicate to global peace? Global intelligence? Global health?<br /><br />What the fuck. I&#039;m downloading (pirating) Korean Rosetta Stone TONIGHT. If we can penetrate the NK regime with resources and aid, education and hope, then a nuclear holocaust can be prevented. You can join me now, or cry over the next 9/11.... because every tragedy we suffer is never the last.... there is always something worse...

Also, the threats they&#039;ve been making, are something they have been doing for a long time and is not a new thing for Kim Jung Un. Kim Jung Il did it all the time as well. They don&#039;t have nukes that could reach America, except for some outer territories. That&#039;s why we haven&#039;t done much. The reason they are so antagonistic at the moment IS the sanctions. America is the one that keeps putting up sanctions, and I agree with you that&#039;s not the right thing to do. The right thing to do is ignore their &quot;threats&quot; until something serious comes up. Remember that time they photoshopped a photo to make it seem like there were more people? Just goes to show that NK is all bark and no bite. The sanction bullshit needs to stop though, agreed.
