				So this is all hypothetical of course. But because of recent events and the state of mind us as citizens are in, I couldn&#039;t help but wonder what if we were on the verge of ww3? <br />I don&#039;t know about some of you but when I&#039;m connected to the Internet I don&#039;t really see borders and ethnicity or what country you&#039;re from. So I can&#039;t help but think when it comes to leaders talking about war, we who have no controll tend to share mutual opinions. <br /><br />So what if our world leaders went a-wall and all hell broke loose?<br />As a community of human beings where does our involvement belong in this?<br />Should we keep a thought, as a community, in the back of our minds that we could utilize our technological resources to prevent catastrophes from happening?<br />Or should we do anything at all?<br /><br /><br />As I said its just hypothetical and theoretical. But in today&#039;s day and age I fell the possibility still exists. I&#039;m just curious as to where do we all stand as individuals?<br />

				WW3 has already started some years ago, NWO will start any day now when the Hoover Dam breaks just like the 50 dollar bill hints about..<br /><br />its 33 years ago they raised the Georgia Guidestones telling you they gonna kill 90% of humanity. When they do rituals they have to tell the victims what they wll do.<br /><br />15% of humanity will get their DNA activated and they will become crystalised on the inside and get superpowers and become immortals, becaue they ate clean natural living food, raw fruit and veggies and their DNA could evolve like planned.<br /><br />85% of humanity will go backwards in evolution and become neandertahl cannibalzombies because they ate the pig, pepsi and soya without knowing they contained human dNA and their DNA devolved instead of evolve.<br /><br />And then there will be a massive war, 85% of humanity + the aliens who fucked the planet up&nbsp; VS.&nbsp; 15% of humanity who got superpowers and immortality..<br /><br />Satans army VS gods army.<br /><br />Thats why we came to this dimension, just to fuk everyone up because they did not care about themselves enough to care about others.

				Look, I&#039;m all for drugs (they&#039;re tasty and full of vitamins) but THIS THREAD is a screaming neon flashing light for some of us to sober the fuck up for a few months.<br /><br />We are not on the verge of WW3. We&#039;re no where near nuclear Armageddon. The nuclear powers ceased real hostilities around 1989. Of course there are no guarantees as long as nukes exist BUT I&#039;d say there is no current looming threat.<br />Crystal Beings ?? Vegans not getting disease?&nbsp; Aliens planning WW3 and crystal caves &quot;proving&quot; ... something ??&nbsp; &nbsp;Da fuck??&nbsp; &nbsp; I used to wonder about people that belonged to cults, like what exactly made them so gullible and easily controlled. This is it folks! People will believe literally anything. All I have to do is tell them some bizarre story that kind of gels with X-file type reality and PRESTO!&nbsp; I can make them eat glass!! I imagine it has to do with the human trait of trying to make sense of our surroundings when so many things seem improper and unjust. Desperation for reason and clarity in a muddy world.<br /><br />But here&#039;s the rub - there are no cosmic secrets other than that which science has not yet answered. There may or may not be aliens among us, there may be a nuclear strike sometime in our lifetimes. It&#039;s simply impossible to know or prove.&nbsp; Believing in Crystal Aliens and half baked conspiracy theories serves no purpose at all. It will just drive you deeper into the rabbit hole. ... but if that&#039;s where you want to be then maybe we can work something out. Just send me all your BtC&#039;s and I will reveal EVERYTHING to you!!

				You cant get sick if your immunesystem wrks properly and it will not work properly if you eat dead foods since we are electrical beings that need electricity to be immune thru our immunesystem..<br /><br />Wft you think a immunesystem is? a joke? <br /><br />This is me without even smoking cannabis so Im fully sober, exept the DMT my pineal gand creates thru meditating.<br /><br />WW3 has alreeady started but you dont know it yet because then you would protect yourself by using the info I gave you in this forum. Most people will not since they dumbed down until the point that they are afraidto get killed if they talked about the ways they are getting killed, from air, water and foods..<br /><br />They spraying chemtrails all days for 10 years now, they are geneticly modifying the foods so you gets the possebility to fuk yourself up since you dont know WW3 has already started. And the tapwater is filled with unhealthy poisons like flouride.<br /><br />Im not here to debate with dumbed down people about their belifs, Im just here to soot some info to the ones who wanna get importality and survive this mess. Most will ignore it and Im not here to debate or b your friends or act and write like you want.<br /><br />I mean just look at my bad karma that &quot;people&quot; gave me on this forum fortrying to promote a way to use BTC and SR to create world peace. They rather watch the Obama-theater-act since thats the leader of the free world hahahaa like there could be leader in a free world..<br /><br />Youre so dumbed down because you would be dangerous to the aliens who is going to come here and eat you, thats why they have to block your soul out first since it will burn them, thats why they spray chemtrails and calcify your pineal glands by giving you flouridated tapwater.. For your own good ofcourse.<br /><br />I see you have alot of +karma so I guess youre here telling people a bunch of bullshit about the world being just as perfect as the politicians said it is on tv/propagandabox.&nbsp; And the dummies keep clapping their hands and cheering for the liers who tell goodsounding lies just like politicians.<br /><br />Like i said I aint here to debate, I have done my thing here, I want to be able to pay to get truths sent thru letters into peoples homes, and by doing that avoid the controll of info that the media think it is because people are to dumb to know how to use the internet where everyone has a voice and no cencors.<br /><br />And you cant tell dummies anything and they just swallow the lie, you first need to get into the propagandabox and put on a tie and suit, then you can tell the lies and the dummies will swallow them without questioning..<br /><br />You cant listen to normal people like me, you need that hollywoodproduction type of infosharing and thats why you will fail. I listen to all normal people since even a dumbass can teach me how to not live my life for example. <br /><br />Youre just afraid to see reality since that would force you to make changes to be able to survive, and thats to much when you care about what others think of you, like what would your slavefriends say if you became a rawfood eater and started caring for animals because you care for yourself enough to not poison your own body like most other people do.<br /><br />Collectivism is what youre life is all about, follow the other sheep even if they do wrong to others.. <br /><br />Real recognise real and I have no fkn idea who the hell you are but youre probably not a human since humans do care about others and theeir homeplanet, many are lost but humans do care while the aliens controlling the democracy puppets does not t care since they have no soul.<br /><br />And you dont care about your soul.. even tho our soul is the sun and we are very special but the aliens taght you that you aint shit since if you knew&nbsp; who you was you would fuk them up without probems, now you dont know who you are and they will eat you up without much&nbsp; problems..<br /><br />You have no explanation of all the crystal caves all over the planet or why some people have crystals comin out of their skins while others bleed like crazy, I have seen 1 girl crying razorsharp crystals without being hurt at all, andI have seen 2 american kids crying blood and the first thing I say is that they might be crystalizing just like the grl who cries crystals, but they aint eating right foods and they are fuckin themselves up totaly without knowing we are going thru BIG evolutionary steps right now.<br /><br />I told you what you can eat if you want to turn into a cannibal zombie, devolve.. The pig, Pepsi, make-up and soyabeans , all of them contain humans DNA so eat them all if you want to go for the cannibal zombie devolution.<br /><br />Evolution does not happen with small changes over long persiods of time and the fossile record show ONLY fully designed animals and no small changes ever, we just find new animals suddenly like they goes thru big evolutionary steps fast and change their designs.<br /><br />But they had to teach you bullshit about smal changes over long periods of time so you ignore that youre here to evolve and not devolve by ignoring everything and acting like a bitch because the most high did not help you. Grow up.<br /><br />I got no fkn money you dummy, Im the worst slave ever born and Im proud of it to, I never sold my lifetime to any of them slaveowners who wanna get rich.<br /><br />I would eat some cannabis tho if someone want to share a small amount of BTC then ofcourse I would b gratefull but Im not into beggin for shit and Im fine without cannabis, but I do theese kind of writings online when I cant calm down hahahahaa its my job.<br /><br />To inform a small part of humanity about the evil aliens in this dimension controlled by the beast, and the way out of this hellhole controlled by the beast. by just writing.<br /><br />That cannabis just makes me lazy and I dont help you humans at all when I be smokin the weed.<br /><br />Shure sometimes I get creative when smokin also and I do write some of the best texts when I hav smoked, I be reading my own texts since i find my own texts interesting hahaha since its not many people who even dares to have personal opinions and share them. Specially about aliens, modern slavery, the economy.. everything the aliens dont want you to know they have been succesfull at fooling you to ignore all the important things here.<br /><br />The human bodydesign is kinda important to know if you wanna stay healthy, what design you say? In schools they taught you that there is no designs since they evolved by themselves, this is the things the aliens have to trick you with since youre a child of the most high and they are not, so they have to trick you with illogical things like designs dont need a designer to put all parts together.<br /><br />Do you really think the first living cell that contains 20 parts that would not work if they was places in the wrong order, do you really think those 20 parts could be put together by accident if we just give noting a long period of time to become something?<br /><br />Is it logical to say something can evolve from nothing just because the schoolsystem said it?

				ok, Roger, I can&#039;t argue with crazy and that is clearly the case here. <br />I can only say 3 things to you - 1) just because you really really want something to be true does not make it so. You have no proof of anything or even an inkling of realism in what you say other than &quot;It must be true because I have just stated it&quot; 2) Your logical thought processes are not functioning correctly. To say things like &quot;You can&#039;t get sick if your immune system works properly&quot; is not anywhere near correct or factual - ever hear of poison, allergies, aging, constitutional construct, bacteria, viruses .. I could go on but I won&#039;t. And how are you linking ones immune system with meat-eating and electricity? And finally 3) You should go back on your prescription meds. They may have some unpleasant side effects but you probably need to touch base with reality.<br /><br />All I can think of when I read threads like this is that THIS is why people who choose to do drugs have such a bad rap with the rest of society. We&#039;re not all crazy but all too often it&#039;s the wack-jobs among us who get the attention for half-assed antics and spacey beliefs that grasp at paper straws. Unfortunately the more drugs these guys consume the more they lose touch with reality. Part of having the freedom to consume drugs is also having the responsibility to lay-off them sometimes to, oh say, keep a job or just keep your head screwed on right. Everyone has different tolerance levels. Being sober sometimes isn&#039;t all that bad for your health.

Im sorry for that.<br /><br />But I did not write to you that cant handle the truth, I wrote for the ones who wanna hear some truths in theese last days.<br /><br />continue using your bullshit drugs and ignoring the powerhouse able to create real drugs in your brain.

I had to pinky promise - but being the ethical crystal being that I am I couldnt keep the secret from such fine lads such as yourselves.<br /><br />Heres some proof:<br /><br />Everybody loves money right? Well.. whats money backwards.. Yenom (Genome). Therefore everybodys GENOMES is just the inverse of money. I talked to my other buddy who happens to be the price of Nigera (long story how we met), but he&#039;s offered to unlock freedom from money by enhancing the Yenom.

				Listen Roger, You seem to have a semblance of rationality by asking the community what they would do. I&#039;m glad that you&#039;re still open to input. Having said that I guarantee that if you start sending letter to all homes filled with your version of &quot;truths&quot; you will, at best, be laughed at and ridiculed, or most likely completely ignored. If you write down a planned violet rebellion against something or someone you will be persecuted and, at worst, jailed. <br /><br />Do you know how many people like yourself claim to have everything all figured out? At any given time there are half a dozen people walking around Jerusalem claiming to be the messiah looking to preach &quot;truth&quot;. There are many many wack-jobs who claim to &quot;know&quot; better than everybody else what is &#039;true&#039;. I urge you to either layoff the drugs and/or start over on your prescribed medications. I don&#039;t mean that as an insult or joke. I think that all of us are ultimately all on our own journey BUT that trip is intertwined with everybody else. In my opinion we&#039;re all kids in the playground. When we die what we preach or &#039;know&#039; won&#039;t matter. What matters, among many other things, is that we were connected to others, that we didn&#039;t become so isolated that we were&nbsp; preaching from afar about things that only seem to make sense to us individually. I struggle with this myself.

				So you did not see that new movie called &quot;This is the end&quot;? created by the same ones who created the movie Pineapple Express about stoners running from killers?<br /><br />You would laugh because youre a dummy and evidence is a theory to you since you got that stockholmsyndrome and you are afraid to see reality. =(<br /><br />Ooh so we are going to jail now for having found evidences online like the cause and cura for cancer?<br /><br />Wow that sound like heaven.. No freedom of speech tho wow or does that sound like HELL ON EARTH?<br /><br />You know they got concentration camps all over the US, FEMA-camps.. Obama want people to &quot;chip up&quot; with the Mark of the beast.<br /><br />Im sorry to say but that revelations part of the bible is accurate according to the evidences we can all see if most of you did not have that stockholmsyndrome they first found in Sweden where I live since I live in the land of the sheepleslaves and they all got that stockholmsyndrome over here.<br /><br />They afraid to get killed if they ever talked about how the government is killing them right now.<br /><br />Wtf are you claiming that I am claiming you fkn dummy? <br /><br />Evidences deside what I &quot;believe&quot; but its actually knowing when you look at evidences.<br /><br />You can claim that evidences are my thought but youre really claiming that youre a fkn idiot and you have no balls to look at evidences so you rather listen to the proagandabox telling you about them old conspiracy theories that has no evidence hahaha when the &quot;theories&quot; came from the evidences and they are protecting their sheeple on their way to the slaughter. You need that Hollywood production to be able to believe them, they have to talk to you from inside the tv or else they aint real, and that is what you will fail at.<br /><br />They aint even real people on tv and they ont have a clue about reality or that thisplanet is done because they did not detach from everything that is killing the planet and they will pay for that since mother Earth is intelligent and she will burn the idiots off like roaches.<br /><br />Mother is about to react to what we have done, detach from the destruction of mother Earthh or get destructed yourself since only her can save you from her. Dummy!!<br /><br />Im no fkn guru or messiah, the aliens are comin and the mark of the beast is what you can get if you wanna get to be a millionaire.. Most people want jesus or aliens to come save them since they cant detach from the destruction of the homeplanet that will kill them.<br /><br />We who could detach from it are on our way the the new Earth where we will restart humanity without the parasites that dont get karma and treats others as you wish to be treated by others, and include animals..
