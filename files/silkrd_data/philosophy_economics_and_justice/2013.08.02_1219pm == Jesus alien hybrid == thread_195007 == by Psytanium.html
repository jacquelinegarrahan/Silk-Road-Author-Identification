				Well, i&#039;m a christian and we traditionally believe that Jesus was born of a virgin, descended from heaven, performed miracles, rose from the dead, and ascended back into heaven, from which he will return.<br />&nbsp;<br />Personally i think that he was an ordinary man, with high level of morals, anarchist (anti-government), a truth speaker, for that he was tortured and murdered by the government.<br />&nbsp;<br />BUT if i have to believe in miracles there must be half real half SC-fictional explanations...<br />5 BC, a genetically-engineered human-alien hybrid sent to Earth, from another planet (heaven), to fertilize the primitive human race and awake the hidden powers of mind, the true meaning of life, peace and love.<br />&nbsp;<br />These alien people (angels made of light) have evolved to the point where they can communicate through telepathy, walk on water and perform miracles. they abducted Mary, and then implanted her with the divine being called Jesus, then they ordered Joseph to protect her!<br /><br />When Mary gave birth, a spaceship returned to make sure that the project is healthy and alive, it appeared as the &quot;Star of Christmas&quot; as we know it, the magi from the east followed this strange light in the sky to Bethlehem, where they found Jesus and worshiped him. The wise men are then given divine warning (thelepatic messages) not to return to Herod so they return to their own country by a different route.<br /><br />The project grew up without knowing his true nature, but somehow he feels that he belong to somewhere esle &quot;My Kingdom is not from this world&quot;.<br /><br />Also after his death, A huge stone was removed easely by his ancestors (aliens / angles) to take his body back for some reasons.<br /><br />Probably this sound stupid but somehow i believe this possibilty.

				For me, I think the &quot;great leap forward&quot; theory is a far more likely contendor for the success of anatomically modern humans. <br /><br />There are probably no secret or special powers hidden within our minds - if they develop henceforth it&#039;ll be a product of evolution and/or the demands of culture and society on our brains, forcing us to use them differently. <br /><br />In my opinion, to date, we really only have the development of language to thank for our recent success as a species, rather than miracles. Complex speech (ie the forming of sentences) has probably been around for about 50,000 years, and basic speech has been around much longer than that. <br /><br />It does seem that there have been several other &quot;smaller leaps&quot; in more modern times, and in fact i&#039;d say we&#039;re living through one now. Again though, we can credit all of these leaps to the sharing of information through language.<br />

				Christianity is a package of very valuable morals, if applied correctly, we will have a big leap froward to enlightenment. As you said, we can credit this leap to previous leaps, basically through language.<br /><br />I believe, psychedelics showed me a trailer of the next huge human leap. Telepathy, object manipulation through thinking, changing reality, time travel, controling time dimension, teleport... I don&#039;t know if you agree , maybe its just hallucination :D

				Ha!<br /><br />Okay, hey, I&#039;m a Christian myself and I&#039;ve often wondered this.&nbsp; There are stories of Reptoid/Pleiadians interacting with humans.&nbsp; One side teaching valuable, loving lessons.&nbsp; The other, fucking our shit up, not respectively.<br /><br />I was literally just thinking about Jesus as imbued with extra-dimensional DNA, or consciousness, by some &quot;other&quot; force.<br /><br />Then again, maybe some bits are a little more literal than others.&nbsp; I could never force myself to pick an interpretation on the more vague stuff, lest I become a bigot X333<br /><br />Much love, brother,<br />~Ali

				+1 for your imagination Psytanium!&nbsp; :D You should write sci-fi or something. Personally, I think Jesus (and all other religious mystics/prophets) had a certain type of brain chemistry which enabled them to achieve mystical/out-of-body experiences, which gave them great status in their respective societies of the time. This argument is neither pro or anti religion, just a recent theory by scientists exploring religious/mystical experiences. Something to do with the temporal lobe of the brain.

				Jesus was a vampire tho and christianity is christi-anti and the idiots following the biggest division of humanity on the planet willl not make it and they are not children of the most high anymore..<br /><br />They are waiting for gods favourite son they love above themdselves since the most high is a terrible parent according to the religions and he wants them to love his favourite son. Not yourself dummy you aint shit, look at jesus. And they love to pray/beg to the murderweapon used to kill jesus on thats how much they love gods favourite son and wants him to come back and save them.<br /><br />People want the world to change but none wants to change the world by changin themselves..<br /><br />People are lazy and they want jesus or aliens to come save them from themselves.<br /><br /><br />So what will happen then you might ask..<br /><br />Aliens are sprayin the sky with chemtrails since 10 years back since aliens are going to put a portal here to be able to get a army of alien insects and their leader lucifer on to this planet to eat all the humans who thought they was meateaters because they read the bible babel and they also &quot;knew&quot; humans are at the top of the foodchain and karma does not exist since they dont really believe in higher powers they know about evolutiontheories and that goverments and religions are the highest power in the universe hahahaa donkeys<br /><br />While 15% of humanity goes thru the sun to the new Earth / heaven on Earth in 5th dimension because they did not create karma by eating animals like the christians did and they listened to their innervoice instead of the outer voice in the bable telling them humans are meateaters when the truth is that humans gets cancer from eating dead foods. And they loved themselves just and they did never put anyone above themselves or mock the most high like the christians did when they said god wants you to love jesus hahahaha dummy thats a very bad parents if he says -love my favourite son very much.<br /><br /><br />So thats the plan but most of humanity will probably not make it to be able to see lucifer and everything unfold since they are spraying the atmosphere to be able to block out the sun and put the portal here and the tapwater is poison and the foods are poison and the skies are poison, and the oceans.<br /><br />-The mark of the beast is already in the foreheads of most of the christians since when they drink flouridated tapwater abd use flouride toothpaste and eat animals they create a shell of bonenmaterial around their pineal gland / the seat of the soul, and they probably to dumb to notice when Obama suggests that everryone should get a microchip aka the second mark of the beast in your arm.<br /><br />Goodluck christians but you should had cared about them animals and yourself some more.<br /><br />You failed so go back and repeat for 26 000 years.<br /><br />85% of humanity will not make it and alot of humans will oose their souls here so this is not all good like the politicians say.<br /><br />Anyway good luck all of you.<br /><br />-much love!

Your religion has absolutely no basis in reality. It was created to shape you and control you. You are blind to the truth (evolution) and believe in fairy tale lies (creationism) with the naivity of small children being told about Santa Claus. It would be perfectly fine other than the fact that we live in a pseudo-democracy, and therefore your mental issues lead to problems for others, when the Preacher tells you that Santa will bring you extra presents if you act against the gays. <br /><br />Seriously I have to wonder if Christians even know the history of their religion, as portrayed by texts that are NOT part of their religion. I wonder if they realize that the only reason they are not freaking Buddhists is because they did not grow up in Asian countries that practice it, and the only reason they are not Hindu is because they did not grow up in India and the only reason they are not Muslim is because they didn&#039;t grow up in the Middle East. Seriously, there have been sooooo many religions throughout history and geographic regions of earth, do you really think that you guys just struck gold with your own brand of improvable fairy tale bullshit that makes absolutely no sense? If you grew up in freaking Pakistan you would be just as die hard about Allah as you are about Jesus. Your mind has some flaw in it that defaults to belief in magic when reality doesn&#039;t make sense to you (don&#039;t feel bad though, all kinds of people believe in magic, even some people who are not religious, unfortunately), and this flaw has been being exploited since you were very young by the brainwashed adults around you, turning you into a brainwashed adult as well. This disease has been spreading since very early human history, and it is just sickening.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> if applied correctly, we will have a big leap froward to enlightenment </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Christianity (and all other religions) and enlightenment do not belong in the same sentence! More like &quot;dark ages&quot;. If not for Christians we would already be in the future technology wise, they held us back and retarded our progress by a thousand years or more, and still to this day they struggle to hold us back in areas such as stem cell research. Instead of using the discarded aborted fetuses to save and improve countless lives, we should just burn them and pray to the imaginary man in the sky to heal us! Not to mention they still teach kids that the magic man in the sky made the entire universe, and that evolution is a bunch of shit.

				@All : I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ - Mahatma Gandhi<br /><br />@kmfkewm : I completely agree on what are you saying about the church. Unfortunately the church do not represent Christianity, never.<br /><br />You think Jesus would have been chasing after the homosexuals ? In fact Jesus was especially known for loving the very people that the religious people of his time had condemned and cast out. He was against the government and religious leaders, a truth speaker, he condemned greed, consumerism, luxury... His ideas on life were very forward-thinking at the time.<br />It is clear that religion was an important support for the government, there was some kind of cooperation between the chief priests and Pilate, they arrested and killed him.<br /><br />Btw, Charles Darwin books have the same importance as the bible, his teachings about the tree of life are part of my religion. <br />Saint Bonaventure taught that the medicinal fruit of the Tree of Life is Christ himself. <br /><br />Jesus (whether he existed or not) symbolize the high magnitude of evolution.

He does according to the bible.<br /><br />He also want humans to eat animals, right after he designed them as herbavores he sat down and wrote in the bible about eating animals, totaly forgetting what kids of design ha created humanity to be.<br /><br />Science say humans get cancer from eating meats and dairy becaue we are herbavores in the design.. The bible knows better tho, the word of the designer of the herbavore bodydesign wants you to eat animals and kill yourself since that is what kind of drunk this godfellow is.<br /><br />Stop mockin the most high and the children of the most high with your stupid ilogical religions and well be alright.

				There is no evidence Jesus existed, and the stories of the New Testament do not match up with known history. Palm Sunday? No historical evidence. Tax census? No historical evidence. Herod&#039;s Massacre? No historical evidence. Christ&#039;s Execution? No historical evidence. Christ himself? The historical evidence starts to appear DECADES AFTER the construction of the Gospels.<br /><br />Given the New Testament virgin/messiah thing (among others) is clearly a multi-plagiarism of existing religions I think it&#039;s more likely it was a money-making scam invented by a later crew.&nbsp; Even so.

We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors&#039; self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So... 97% of the authors that wrote peer reviewed literature endorsing Global Warming between 1991- 2011, endorse AGW. <br />(Not to mention... Of which, they are only 32.6% of all AGW literature authors in that time frame.)<br /><br />Might as well just as go to a baptist church and ask how many there are baptists.&nbsp; Same thing.<br /><br />Scientific consensus?&nbsp; More like statistical cherry picking.

				Who is going to save you first tho? is it aliens or jesus or both?<br /><br />We have Diclosure Project now and its all about askin the aliens controlling the governments if the aliens in space can come down and save humanity.<br /><br />Both religious idiots and atheist idiots will get their belifs totaly crushed very soon when they realise that governments is NOT the highest power in this universe and that the government they thought was their caringparent is actually aliens hating on humanity and starting world wars and creating governments to divide and conquer humanity.

				People who put themselves into categorys will not make it, specially the ones who put themselves into the &quot;christ and allah -division&quot; of humanity.<br /><br /><br />If you call yourself a christian, american or dentist.. You are only the slavecathegory to place yourself in it and say that youre one of those slaves that fall into that cathegory.<br /><br />It&#039;s all about loving yourself since if you dont then the planet will not take you with her to the new Earth (the rapture).<br /><br />Thats why religions want you to love and beg/pray to gods favourite son instead of beliving in yourself, and they dont even realise that they are sayin the most high is a very bad parent and he wants you to love his favourite son..<br /><br />Chrsitianity is christi-anti just like it sound when you say christianity repetedly faster and faster. Against yourself, anti christ..

				Hahahaha you dumbass there is no leaders in higher dimensions only in this lowest dimension controlled by the beast..<br /><br />ITs alot of alien souls in human bodies and most of them came in the 80&#039;s and they have indigoblue auras, some call them the indigochildren..<br /><br />In the 90&#039;s there was crystalchildren comin and they was even more rebels then the indigos.<br /><br />And now after 2000 it is alot of rainbowchildren and they are the ones showing you a new way of living, the earlier children also but the rainbowchildren are more complete the 80s babies had a hard time in this sick world, thats why they put them on medications and think its something wrong with them since they should obey and be happy about being forced to go to slavetraining/school since its best for them that a slaveowner can make money from their workeffort later in life.<br /><br />But they really came here with the mission to break down the system of controll and the monopoly on using force and voilence aka the governments.. So the evil aliens figured out that its easy to trick humans into shooting up their kids with a minimum of 10 vaccines filled with mercury, &quot;for their own good&quot; ofcourse..<br /><br />None of theese children cares about your dumbass since you dont see their gifts or their mission and they aint here for you, they came to get a small part of humanity that will restart humanity in a higher dimension while you dummies gets to repeat short lives since youre dumbed down to the point that you think youre the smartest omnivore on th planet, but youre really a dumbass herbavore whos tricked by aliens to believe youre a omnivore since they want to eat some humans when they cant get out of here in a few years when the portals open since they created to much karma by eating animals and that karma forced them to get eaten by massive aliens.<br /><br />some people see auras and they react to the indigoauras since they are alien soul who came here to help, i have experienced it myself when grown ups sta&nbsp; to act very weird like they are groupies to a child, it made me kinda confused as a kid when a women started acting like I was celebrity hahahahaa<br /><br />Now i know its probably because she see auras and thats probably the reason why I had a hard time with some of the grownups, since if they see auras and know about the mission of the indigoauras then they would try to make a living hell for that kid.. And they alsomt did but I managed it good anyways and survived this sick world.<br /><br />go tell that to your religions that there is alien souls walkin around in human bodies and they would bring out the cross and say youre psycopaths, since they probably know what the indigos are here for.<br /><br />We gonna burn the shit out of you calcified sheeple when we gets our DNA fully activated, indigos have a part of thier DNA already activated when they are born, crystalchildren have even more of their DNa active and rainbow had even more then that..<br /><br />And you normal people listen to scientists who &quot;know&quot; that junkDNA is just junk but they have to say they dont really know what it is, they just know its junk hahahahahaaaa<br /><br />And most normal people believe them since belifs are all you got since knowing is to much, you have to type in words into google and press enter to be able to get informed and that alot of work for a believer.<br /><br />

				Youre both very funny human clowns who have been here for tousands of years doing the same bullshit in different bodies without learning anything about life..<br /><br />Some grownups see auras and they are the ones who is going to mess with the indigo children..<br /><br />And some grownups go the other way because of the aura and they act like groupies since indigo auras are rare..<br /><br />I hope youre ready for the war in a few years, not that you will be able to protect yourself at all after turning into cannibal neadertahls because of the human DNA you eat..<br /><br />The pig, Pepsi, make-up and soya, its humans DNA in them all and people who eat them will devolve into cannibal zombies and they will probably try to eat their family and friend so watch out for the ones who eat alot of pig.<br /><br />When it comes to Pepsi and make-up they are using aborted babies and selling them to the manifacturers so they can put the babies into make-up and Pepsi so people can drink dead babies and put the dead babies on their face so they look like someone else since they aint good enough in their original form.<br /><br />Make-up is something you do with a bed when you have slept in it and its messy..<br /><br />And on girls faces since they are born messy in the face and they aint goodlookin enough as they was born..<br /><br />I know folks, youre to immature to handle info like this so you will probably have to write the same shit again, write about your belifs please we all need to hear your belifs, we evolves from hearing your belifs hahahaa dummies.<br /><br />Now stfu!

				Hey thats just common sense, they are using pigskin and organs on humans without problems..<br /><br />Do you think we could just walk out into nature and pick a random animal and use its organs on a human who need a new organ?<br /><br />That would not work since the DNA is not matching..<br /><br />It works with the pig because the DNA match eachothers.
