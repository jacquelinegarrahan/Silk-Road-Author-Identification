				One of the things about the drug prohibiton that really bothers me (well actually everything about the drug prohibition bothers me, but here&#039;s something I wanna talk about ;)) is that I have to hide my drug habits. Being a &quot;drug user&quot; is very taboo in our society. I have to hide my lifestyle from fucking everyone. Everyone who doesnt do drugs, that is. Or everyone that I think doesn&#039;t do drugs. They could be hiding it from me! <br /><br />I fucking hate that. I&#039;d like to stand on the street corner, smoking a joint. I don&#039;t want to look over my shoulder every time I spark up in public. Fuck that shit. I&#039;m a proud potead. I want people to know how much I enjoy smoking herb.

				Smoking like that in public makes me paranoid. I quit smoking in public.<br />Even at parties IF I use mj, I like not to be seen by everyone like I&#039;m THE pothead of the party.<br />This comes with age I guess.<br />I like to use mj alone for example, with just my girl cause it gets me really introspective and not so social.<br />I learned this after years of use.<br />

And all this manipulation as well is so disgusting((<br /><br />I do drink sometimes alcohol, but its nothing I do because I love it or because I enjoy it or because I get some positive use out of it<br />On the other hand, I love to smoke weed. Weed makes me calm, weed makes more open to other people, weed makes me feel very introspective, philosophical and thoughtful. Yes, I do also love to get with my friends high when we have a lot of fun, laugh and good time. But first of all for me weed is the substance which helps me deal with my inner problems, fears, wishes and dreams.<br /><br />In comparison to it , alcohol drinking gives me nothing, really nothing. Some crazy fun time with other people, some &quot;empty&quot; dull bla-bla and hangover the day after ((<br /><br />so brothers, you are not alone<br /><br />but who cares in this world ruled by those who only interested in their profit and own filthy wishes???

				You&#039;re definitely not alone here!<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if people don&#039;t know better and don&#039;t see the problems in our Western society, or are just willfully ignorant because &quot;it ain&#039;t that bad&quot; for them due to the acquired money and power.<br /><br />Deep inside you know some fundamental world views will have to change if we as humans are to live up to our true potential!

				Half the problems that &quot;drug addicts&quot; have is the fact that they are forced to be dishonest with the world.&nbsp; Having to lie and put on a false front is bad for the psyche and contributes to the behavior society thinks of as bad.&nbsp; You can&#039;t be held accountable for your actions when you can&#039;t even be honest about your actions for fear of being thrown into prison with murderers, rapists and thieves aka real criminals.

				&nbsp; I&#039;m with you on that, even though I like to be somewhat discrete about my habits of indulgence. <br />&nbsp;My first real &quot;wow&quot; moment, was when I traveled to a big city and saw people shooting up, smoking crack on the street.&nbsp; It WAS the ghetto, but still, interesting how it worked out, and no fucks were given. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second time, was when I left the US and was traveling in Canada, now, people say Canada is just like the US, but there are serious differences.&nbsp; In Montreal, you can buy and smoke weed in public, you can smoke crack in public even, in a not-that-shitty neighborhood.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was in this real posh park downtown, with a fountain, and I&#039;m smoking a fattie I&#039;d bought the night before, when I see this guy start fighting with someone, WHOOP WHOOP and a police cruiser pulls up, throws the guy on the hood, takes his crack, gives him his bag of weed back, and doesn&#039;t arrest him, just gives him a stern warning and takes the cuffs off.&nbsp; We had been smoking weed in full view of police cameras the entire time.&nbsp; Try that in NYC, see how far you get with the NYPD.&nbsp; That was inspiring, and gives me hope to this day, as does the situation in the medical/legal states.

				Ya dont have to hide it from us bro!!!!<br />WE are pretty much all in the same boat, and especially forum members, that why we come here to discuss everything from drug laws to politics and social problems and much more.<br /><br />Whats the best country to move to for non-judgemental drug-use? This is the question. It has been asked before and is opinion based but everyone can agree its not USA. So lets find a utopia and built it to our specs ;) Unfortunately SR is THAT utopia, and its limitations are that it is only virtual. So when a physical society exists that meets our ideaologies, i am certain it will flourish. Although every other country will hate it:)<br /><br />The best way ive found to cope with this judgement and non-understanding of drug use is to be honest about other semi-taboos.. for example i support gay-marriage because in my mind it relates back to freedom &gt; drug use... The name of the game is freedom.

A Midwestern state I was in made it a crime to be intoxicated on anything other than alcohol. Laws like that are probably pretty rare, as this was a backwards rural state. <br /><br />There&#039;s also the issue of public intoxication, which is illegal pretty much everywhere. Public intoxication for most illegal drugs would be a tough sell for all but the lightest of lightweights. Interesting fact: in Montana public intoxication is not a crime. One can be locked up overnight until sober, but no record can be kept of such an event. <br /><br />People who drink alcohol but support drug prohibition bother me a lot more than totally straight edge people who hate all mind-altering substances. I don&#039;t agree with the people who hate all mind-altering substances, but at least they&#039;re not hypocrites. <br />

				Alright, I stand corrected.&nbsp; In a few states it may be illegal to be under the influence of controlled substances and yes public intoxication laws still apply.&nbsp; That said the burden of proof lies on them and as of April of this year police can no longer force you to take a blood test as it&#039;s a violation of the fourth amendment.<br /><br />If a cop asks if you&#039;re high politely pleading the fifth will get you out of 95% of all situations.&nbsp; If you smell like weed you may get searched but if you&#039;re not carrying so what.&nbsp; If you&#039;re high and disorderly well, that&#039;s a different story and where public intoxication laws usually come in.&nbsp; Being drunk in public isn&#039;t illegal in most states, if it was we wouldn&#039;t have bars and large areas devoted to bar hopping as everyone would be getting arrested.&nbsp; It&#039;s when you&#039;re drunk and being an ass that you&#039;ll find yourself in trouble.

				The problem with drugs being legal is that there are vested interested to keep them ILLEGAL from many industries that our governments are in bed with. It&#039;s only natural that these drugs that we like are illegal.<br />Cannabis alone competes with oil industry, big pharma and cops love making money from seizing assets of people who deal pot. There are too many parties which are only too happy to keep weed illegal. <br /><br />Until we have a major revolution, where people pick up spades and pitch forks, nothing will change. <br /><br /><br />Here we are discussing how drugs should be legalised for recreational use and medicine while folks like Bill Gates, Henry Kissinger and many other elites are discussing how to reduce and cull the world population through vaccines and GMO food. I dont know about you guys, but making our lifes easier and happier is the last thing on these people&#039;s minds... We are losing more and more freedom everyday.<br /><br />Until we all revolt, nothing will change. And media makes it only harder for an everyday citizen to see for themselves that not all drugs are bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;
