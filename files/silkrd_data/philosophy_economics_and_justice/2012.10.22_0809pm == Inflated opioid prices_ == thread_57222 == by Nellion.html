				Just wanted to get everyone&#039;s take on the ridiculous prices of opioids these days.<br /><br />I am a proud member of Generation Rx and I remember in late middle school, when I &quot;started&quot; that prices were very reasonable- hydrcodone 10s for $2-3, OC 80s for $30-$40 (the original formula), methadone 10s for $4, and so on. And, these prices were very reasonable and you got your money&#039;s worth for the high you could get from each pill<br /><br />Any more, you&#039;re lucky to find hydrcodone 10s for $5! I quit buying them after they passed $4, because they&#039;re really not worth it. I&#039;ve always had a high tolerance to things, even starting out, and it would take me 40 mg of hydro to feel a decent buzz. I am OK with paying $16 for a couple hours of feel good. $20 if I&#039;m having a shitty day and am desperate. $6 is my cut-off and will likely get you a cussing if I know you in person$3 and try to sell them to me for that. But, these days, hydrocodone doesn&#039;t do much at all for me and will take me AT LEAST 80mg to even be worth swallowing (cold water extraction, of course). <br /><br />Why do people think hydrocodone is such a potent painkiller, doctors included? Perhaps I did it to myself by raising my tolerance, but if people didn&#039;t think hydrocodone was pure gold, I would be OK with suffering the consequences of having to buy more to get high, as at $3 per 10, that&#039;s $24 and is reasonable. <br /><br />However, $48 for 2 hours of the second shittiest opioid buzz available (codeine being first) is FAR from worth it. Hydrocodone is very weak and doesn&#039;t last nearly long enough to pay $48 for a buzz.<br /><br />Perhaps I&#039;m nitpicking, but this is what drives people to injecting. Obviously, since people think hydrocodone is a gold mine, they assume oxycodone is a diamond mine, and oxymorphone worth even more. With the amount of money people are asking for these pills nowadays, it is only feasible to buy them if you plan to inject them. And, personally, I think injecting is one of the baddest monkeys out there and absolutely ruins oral consumption for people and is a fast rack to a downward spiral. Once you feel that rush, it&#039;s over, Swallowing pills doesn&#039;t completely scratch the itch for your any longer.<br /><br />So, why do you guys think the price of opioids have inflated so much? And, is it justified, in your opinions? I understand that you are expected to pay a premium to cover convenience and shipping and whatnot. That&#039;s fair, I guess... But, the prices on the streets I roam are pretty similar. <br /><br />You guys think it&#039;s due to overall inflation and devaluing of the currency? Think it&#039;s from people who ventured into injecting who could reasonably offer a few dollars more here and a few more there to ensure they get there dope, effectively pressuring more and more people into injecting to get the best bang for their buck? Think it&#039;s due to unscrupulous dealers, the overall increase of popularity of opioids?<br /><br />Personally, I think it&#039;s a combination of both. Opioids are the PERFECT work drug. They give you a generally positive attitude about working, and personally, allow me to volunteer for a lot of overtime hours. I think the devalued and inflated currency and crappy economy is causing more and more people to turn to opioids so they can work harder and earn more money, and unscrupulous dealers are taking advantage of the increased demand and asking for more money for their product so that they foot the bill of their increased grocery bills due to inflation and the shitty economy. Then, to get more bang for their buck they turn to injecting which will cause them to pay more and more as their habit progresses. Then, once a dealer gets $10 more than usual for a set amount of dope, it feeds his greed and so he eventually raises the prices for everyone and the cycle resets and starts over.<br /><br />However, whatever it is, I don&#039;t like it. I have had to seriously scale back my opioid consumption and I LOVE my opioids. But, I refuse to pay this inlfated ass prices to these greedy bastards. I just wish consumers would quit paying these ridiculous prices so dealers would lower them. But, I doubt that&#039;s going to happen because opioids are known to cause irrational behavior that manifests from the dependence on them.<br /><br />And that&#039;s the bottom line, IMO- dealers charge more because they CAN. They know a lot people are hooked on opioids and will continue to pay for them regardless of price. There is no incentive to lower price because demand just keeps on growing.<br /><br />Luckily, though, I&#039;ve forged a pretty solid network of opiophiles who have learned to treat each other fairly as it&#039;s cheaper for everyone in the long run when everyone isn&#039;t trying to get top dollar from everyone else. Thank god for that. Otherwise, I wouldn&#039;t be doing any opioids at all because I&#039;m too damn hard headed to give someone $6 for 10mg of hydrocodone.<br /><br />Oh yeah- to all you assholes who think OxyContin is Jesus piss... OxyContin is only oxycodone, which is only SLIGHTLY stronger than hydrocodone. IT IS NOT WORTH $1/mg, especially the anti-abuse formula ones! It doesn&#039;t make it any more valuable just because it has &quot;oxy&quot; in the name. Fuckers.

				Not done many Oxy&#039;s etc as i&#039;ve never really seen much of them on the streets over here in the UK. I used to do hydro&#039;s but like you say wouldn&#039;t even bother anymore as they&#039;re not worth the money IMO.<br /><br />So its mainly just H for me, over here on the street that means number 3 only. Whilst the price for 1/8s and upwards has definitely gone down - i wouldn&#039;t pay more than Â£90, especially if you want to sell, the quality has taken an absolute nose dive. I Back in the late 90s when i first started it was so much better quality and tasted like gear when you smoked it on foil, about 5/6 years ago it seemed to have got lots worse but its only gotten worse every year IMO. So despite the price drop the real price has actually gone up loads cos you&#039;re paying for so much cut and crap. I really don&#039;t know where these govt stats about the price dropping come from. Personally i blame it on people at the very top continuing to buy crap - probably eastern european gangs. Its not even a regional thing as i&#039;ve lived all over the country and have got good scores all over the place as i&#039;ve been on so long and travel a lot with work. I reckon off personal observation theres nowhere near as many younger addicts as there were in my generation in my area (i guess that&#039;s probably actually a good thing though!!) and i&#039;m not surprised if all they&#039;ve ever known is the crap that&#039;s around nowadays!<br /><br />I&#039;m fairly new to SR and have so far stuck to number 4 to treat myself really cos you can&#039;t get it here and only had it before whilst traveling the world! I&#039;ve been lucky and the quality has been pretty good - though nothing earth shattering and not even as good as &#039;old skool&#039; 90s number 3 on the street. Am gonna try a few number 3 guys soon but think the prices on that seem pretty damn high but if its quality then that&#039;s not too bad but don&#039;t reckon it would ever be worth doing it commercially which i had hoped for when i found the place.<br /><br />Oxys etc just seen crazy prices to me as well so haven&#039;t bothered. Perhaps its my naivity but why do they seem to be more expensive than gear?

				If you like injecting, you&#039;ve got to try the hydromorphone (Diluadid) and the oxymorphone IR (Opana IR) thru IV.<br /><br />That&#039;s where it&#039;s, man. Way better than any H I&#039;ve tried. However, with the Opana, be sure you don&#039;t try to inject the new pills with the anti-abuse agent in them. One 10 mg Opana IR or 8-12 mg Diluadid would treat the social user very well. However, with me, I had to quit using IV because it was a beast I was not able to control. I am able to control myself MUCH better with oral consumption.<br /><br />However, I would most definitely like to get some china white from here as that&#039;s one thing I&#039;m yet to try. Only thing is- I would be a bit scared as it&#039;s MUCH more potent and do not know what my dose would be.
