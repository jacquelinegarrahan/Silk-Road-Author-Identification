				I got a lot of money recently from doing a big job for somebody and thought this was the only place to ask since it came from an illegal source. Anyway, it&#039;s Â£8,000,000 and I live not far from London which I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s helpful or not. Is it possible to put it in a bank and jus live off the interest or what? What&#039;s the best way to go about living off it and getting a yearly return like a wage.

				8 million at 7% in the bank will make you about 540k a year interest...<br /><br />Talk to a banker.. not to anyone here!!!<br /><br />if this is true.. congrats and if you do it right you and your family should never have to worry about work again!<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />

A good rate will be about 4% right now for most banks although I&#039;d actually advise not speaking to a banker, but a wealth management specialist (slightly different, but Barclays has a big division for it) who could manage a portfolio full time for you. Remember that 4% will be 2.4% after tax on the higher band is accounted for.<br /><br />In addition, we also have a current inflation rate of 2.2% which really will cut into that savings as you can see.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=59140.msg546557#msg546557">Quote from: Reece on October 26, 2012, 03:38 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">@ OP : Invest in property, trust me. :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nope, nope, definitely not. Long term asset sure, but it is a very risky market to play right now just because of low interest and high demand but it won&#039;t keep up forever unless he&#039;s willing to buy the house outright (which I don&#039;t recommend either for a variety of reasons).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I dont know about the UK and what not.. but in canada you cam make a easy 7% if you do it right... but yes..then there will be taxes... but still 8 million euro can go a real long way.

Anyway, you want a criminal banker, money launderer etc, any regular banker won&#039;t cut it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Any half decent investment banker here in canada can work wonders with 8million Euro&#039;s. Its not hard to get 4% in a normal savings account if you have a large enough amount,.... then you have bonds at 5%&nbsp; &nbsp;and mutual funds.... which is more of a risk but still a much more viable option... Anyways.... Talk to a professional is what I really meant to say before...<br /><br />Also I know you were not quoting me.. I juts quoted you because you asked for some ideas..<br /><br />&nbsp;8)<br /><br />

				All those percentages are nice, but if the money is in cash, you can&#039;t just bring it to a bank. You will need somebody to help you launder it, somebody who knows his stuff and won&#039;t rat on you. Good luck with that.

				Yes the money is laundered enough to my knowledge, it&#039;s already in my bank but I&#039;m just not sure how best to invest it or place it so I can earn a regular wage to live off. @John - StExo is right, you can&#039;t get rates like that in the UK really which is a shame but I&#039;ve just checked on Google and I can&#039;t seem to find much in the way of 7% in Canada, could you point me in the right direction so I could check it out please?<br /><br />I don&#039;t have many bank contacts but as I said the money is already in my account so I&#039;m just looking how to best invest/save for maximum yearly return.

I cant tell you more info because I have a steak in this fund myself and have been in it for a while.. Giving out info can surely land me in some trouble if prying eyes are watching and we know they are.<br /><br />Just shop around... 7% is easy to make if you do some research and look for yourself..<br /><br />just dont be sold on the first pitch! make sure you look around.... Try banks like TD, Royal Bank, CIBC, Bank of Montreal ect..... if you really have all that money tho.. even in the uk you can still make it work for you.... i think you just may not be in the &quot;loop&quot; <br /><br />Even with a simple google search you will find almost 5% Bonds from the UK. I found 4.75% surely there must be better if you dig deeper!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br /><br />Good luck buddy.

				Get into the Hempcrete construction business....<br /><br />Buy land, get people to grow the crop for you, harvest it, process it and then build homes for you using the plants woody core (hurd) ...<br /><br />Create jobs, benefit the world, become a hempcrete pimp.&nbsp; The industry is just waiting for people like you to drive it forward&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Lots of money to be made in construction.. especially when you&#039;re using top notch building material<br /><br />Yes, it is work.. but considering about 1-2 acres of hemp can be enough resources to build a 2 story home...<br /><br />100 acres grown yearly could allow you to build 20-50 quality homes a year... <br /><br />Once you&#039;ve figured out how it all works... you could truly be making millions a year profit easily.. and it could essentially run itself after a few years of work and planning..<br /><br />Then again, there are probably a lot easier ways to live off 8 million euros.. shit just travel the world forever with that coin.. what more do you need?&nbsp; If you aren&#039;t one to ball the fuck out, you could have amazing travels experiences for the rest of your life...
