				Kafka on the Shore - Haruki Murakami<br /><br />Not really sure if the kid in the story comes from a destitute home, but he runs away from it none the less.&nbsp; I&#039;m not really a person to reread a book but I&#039;ve read this three times, which tells you how in love with this book I am.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wind Up Bird Chronicle is a better start to his writing style tho.&nbsp; I almost got fired from my job at the time of reading cause I wouldn&#039;t put the damn thing down.<br /><br /><br />Also.....<br /><br />Special shout out to House of Leaves.&nbsp; It&#039;s like a much more evolved version of Be Here Now.&nbsp; Less hippy, and an actual plot, but even that is selling it short.&nbsp; This literally changed reality around me when I was reading it.&nbsp; Not really about a broken home either.... more like an altered home.&nbsp; The time of my life and what this story did for me is unforgettable.&nbsp; Maybe it&#039;s just me tho.

				The Passage by Justin Cronin.&nbsp; &nbsp; Its like Stephen King at his coked up best.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to spoil it by revealing anything about the plot but it is a superb book. He&#039;s written a sequel &#039;The Twelve&#039; and its going to be a trilogy eventually<br />

				I&#039;m not going to go back and forth from my laptop desk to my library, but I will list a few authors that I quite enjoy. I&#039;m a voracious reader, and several of the vacations I take each year are to catch up on reading. I&#039;ll go somewhere tropical by myself a couple times each winter with a stack of books to just relax and read.<br /><br />In no particular order, I enjoy reading the works of:<br /><br />Wilbur Smith<br />Michael Connelly<br />Elmore Leonard<br />David Baldacci<br />Jeffrey Deaver<br />Kathy Reichs<br />Stephen Frey<br />Michael Crichton<br />John Grisham<br />Alex Rutherford<br /><br />If you&#039;re looking for specific book recommendations, I&#039;d be willing to pull a few off the shelves in my library to list my most favorite titles. These are fairly mainstream authors though, but let me know.<br /><br />Also, OP, if you want to send me a PM about your additional question, I might have some books you&#039;d find interesting, as family law and the reform thereof is a particular interest of mine.

				Ah, Huxley.... I sometimes long for the decadent country house lifestyle he describes in &quot;crome yellow&quot;....the reality is that my ancestors at this time were miners,&nbsp; potato merchants, and domestic servants, and even the servants masters were people who Huxely would have regarded as barely gentlemen.<br />(Go on, dox my geneology!)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After many a Summer &quot; is another good SF book he wrote, although it could have made a better SHORT story.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Ends and Means&quot; is an interesting book, advocating solving the worlds problems (interstate violence) by addressing the individual through meditation and mysticism. Slightly ill timed (1937)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Island&quot;? Those birds chirping &quot;attention&quot; to constantly remind one of the &#039;now&#039; make me want to wring their necks!&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Huxley was basically an elitist who would have been horrified at the use ofLSD by prole scum like us. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One thing i notice in his books is the inclusion of long passages of French, Italian, German and Latin and Greek, without translation. The assumption being that if you were reading a novel in those days, you had received sufficient education to understand these.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don&#039;t want to cone down to hard on Huxley, I read most of his books as a teenager. Brave New World is a much more accurate description of the future than 1984, I think. But, like Jack Kerouac, as time has gone on, I like him less and less. (I mean I dislike Kerouac, I have no information regarding his feelings on Huxley) Kerouac comes off as a self pitying drunk.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Recently, his wife/girlfriend revealed that the famous scroll of On the Road, (purportedly scrawled in three weeks of Benzedrine fury) in fact was the product of months and months of agonized reediting.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its Orwell and Burroughs for me I&#039;m afraid<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I really wish Burroughs had stuck to the dry style of &quot;junky&quot; (&quot;You are both motherfuckers&quot; Her tone was matter if fact as if referring to actual incest)<br />His later &#039;cut up&#039; work ( Naked lunch,&nbsp; Soft Machine) while full of memorable imagery, never really worked for me.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would recommend Junky, and Ah Pook is Here, to blow your mind<br /><br /><br />Non fiction: 1491. And sequel 1493 by Charles C Mann. These accounts of the Americas immediately before, and then after the European contact, are endlessly fascinating to me.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did you know that Squanto the freindly English speaking indian, who helped the colonists, had actually chosen his name after coming back from years overseas (kidnapped by sailors )to find his homeland a bone strewn, smallpox devestated wilderness, and his name actually meant something close to &quot;Wrath of God&quot;?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The tales of Maroon communities (of escaped slaves and local Indians) are equally amazing. Apparently many Indians first contact was with escaped Africans rather than Europeans.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is surprisingly little information in popular culture about the early days of this huge, world changing event (the Columbian exchange).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I dunno, the rest of Irvine Welsh I think could reasonably be entitled &quot;stuff that wasn&#039;t good enough to go into trainspotting&quot; . I mean he tried to branch out with Acid House and Marabou Stork, but he seems just to have settled for giving us what we want : more &#039;the sweat was lashin offay Sick boy, ahm no sick meself , no yet, but its in the post&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trainspotting was phenomenal though. I&#039;ve always been the literary type but it was the first time I remember there being this buzz about a BOOK. I read the first page and was begging my mate to let me read it because I knew he&#039;d take months whereas I could suck it down in a few days. In the end I got it from the library (remember those? Now I get all my books for free online!) and it was a dark and unsettling read.....is this what we are really like? The film was ok but the book has so much much more<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve read all his other stuff since but I kind of feel, like so many authors, (and bands and directors etc.) his first work he had spent his life up until then creating, and then the second, and third, are produced under pressure and to a deadline.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some artists manage to get out from under the shadow of their first work, but precious few. I don&#039;t think Welsh is one of them, although I continue to read his stuff.&nbsp; It was satisfying to find out what happened to the characters after, then before, but.....I can read about Scottish smackheids all day, but I don&#039;t think he&#039;s got anything else to give. Still, easy for me to criticise. I&#039;d be happy to have produced one Trainspotting.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This syndrome is particularly noticeable with rappers/ hip hop groups. The first album is like the stuff they have been working out since they were teenagers. The second is made in a year in a studio with shitloads of coke and loads of yes men.

				The novel I&#039;m reading right now is &quot;The Judas Strain&quot; by James Rollins.&nbsp; It&#039;s one of those fast paced novels filled with secret societies, religious occult, and elite government agents battling to save the world.&nbsp; I&#039;m half way in and it&#039;s been a solid read, I would recommend it if you are interested in that type of book.

I have read all of his other books and been profoundly affected by this one, and the Bridge Across Forever the Most. <br /><br />In the vein of Richard Bach is Hugh Prather. He wrote Notes to Myself, among other books. They have the notes he keeps writing as he finds his way in the world of functional adulthood. My favorite from Notes, &quot;If the desire to write is not accompanied by writing, the desire is not to write.&quot;<br /><br />In the fiction world, I love alternate histories, scifi, and military sci fi. So David Webber with his Honor Herrington series rocks my world. Then there is Robert Jordan&#039;s the Wheel of Time books. I would have had that man&#039;s bastard two headed fuzzy kittens but he died in 2007.<br /><br />If you have never read any Terry Pratchett, what are you waiting for, the man has Parkinson&#039;s and won&#039;t be writing or even wiping his own ass very much longer.

Auel - immerses you into life in ice age europe, there&#039;s a few volumes been appearing, the first two &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; and &quot;The Valley of Horses&quot;<br /><br />The Neverending Story by Michael Ende - not just a children&#039;s book, it&#039;s an adventurous journey into the realm called &quot;phantasia&quot; and back.

				David Foster Wallace&#039;s &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (huge, but worth it)<br />J.G.
