I would say the style is influenced by tupac though. I can rap like lil wayne too and it is actually the most fun to write rhymes in that style, but it tends to be more frivolous and just demonstrating a technical expertise of rhyme rather than meaningful from the heart. I actually wrote several poems on SR under the name poems, I can post under that name if anyone needs confirmation but just to highlight <br /><br />more lyrically fun:<br /><br />im a fire spidda you could call me a dragon man<br />im fuckin widda crew of loose cannons and baggin grams<br />instrumental killa - get a beat ill decapitate it<br />fuck spittin out whack - im calibrated<br />in fact i&#039;m elevated , while hella faded collaborated with the beat<br />&nbsp;but then I gotta fade it, cuz it cooperated, corroborated so I spit sprayed it<br />slayed it, that shit be weapon graded<br />my wits sharp , i&#039;m quick shit i&#039;m switch bladed<br />haters they some big bitches like fat ladies<br />im blazed up smokin that kush lookin to raise up<br />was aged up broken then booked and caged up<br /><br />(I never found a good way to finish this. Wrapping down is a challenge. Starting is often a challenge as well but generally something that signifies genesis works the best, tho if it is just for lyrical fun then i&#039;m --- is a good starter as well). <br /><br /><br /><br />and more meaningful things, here is my LSD ego death<br /><br />Once released,<br />I rose up and decayed into little pieces<br />then everything blew away<br />leaving infinite peace<br />revealing everywhere through space and time<br />unveiling the concealing by my human mind of what&#039;s whole<br />many bodies and kinds yet one soul<br />in my vision our division appeared clearly separated<br />then it faded away, alleviating my fear and pain <br /><br /><br />mostly I just write rhymes because it is fun and gives me something to do, and I have done it pretty consistently since I was 12 or so and that makes it fun to see improvement (tho I rarely save anything other than to memory). I never really intended to share anything. I actually wouldn&#039;t even say any of these are finished, I take from old material and redo it and mix it up quite frequently.

I was imagining the military dress synchronized dancers in the background and Flava Flav joining in at the end of every line.<br /><br />Anyway I didn&#039;t write this and I guess I&#039;m an atheist but this poem moved me immensely:<br /><br /><br />　　As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies dráw fláme;<br /><br />　　As tumbled over rim in roundy wells<br /><br />　　Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell’s<br /><br />　　Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;<br /><br />　　Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:<br /><br />　　Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;<br /><br />　　Selves—goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,<br /><br />　　Crying Whát I do is me: for that I came.<br /><br />　　Í say móre: the just man justices;<br /><br />　　Kéeps gráce: thát keeps all his goings graces;<br /><br />　　Acts in God’s eye what in God’s eye he is—<br /><br />　　Christ—for Christ plays in ten thousand places,<br /><br />　　Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his<br /><br />　　To the Father through the features of men’s faces.<br /><br />　　—GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The man was a catholic and a Jesuit, and I don&#039;t share his beliefs, but this poem, like the rythym and the internal rhymes (it actually SOUNDS like a stone bouncing down a well at the start) did something to my brain.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The unusual accents are in the original, not sure what they are about.<br />

				I wanted to share this quote from Carl Sagan with everyone here. Its beautiful and poetic. It really puts things in perspective for me and I hope it does the same to you. The picture Sagan is referring to was taken by Voyager 1 in 1990. In the picture, Earth can barely be made out to be a tiny spec. I hope you enjoy. <br /><br />&quot;We succeeded in taking that picture [from deep space], and, if you look at it, you see a dot. That&#039;s here. That&#039;s home. That&#039;s us. On it, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, thousands of confident religions, ideologies and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilizations, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every hopeful child, every mother and father, every inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every superstar, every supreme leader, every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.<br /><br />The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and in triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of the dot on scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner of the dot. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity -- in all this vastness -- there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. It is up to us. It&#039;s been said that astronomy is a humbling, and I might add, a character-building experience. To my mind, there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly and compassionately with one another and to preserve and cherish that pale blue dot, the only home we&#039;ve ever known.&quot; -Carl Sagan
