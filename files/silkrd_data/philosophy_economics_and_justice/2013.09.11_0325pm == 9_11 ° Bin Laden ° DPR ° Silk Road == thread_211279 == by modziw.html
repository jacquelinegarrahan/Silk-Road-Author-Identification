				Oh my god it&#039;s 9/11 I just realized. I haven&#039;t watched TV for about 3 months, if I did these days then I would know because of the one quadzillion documentarys that run. :)<br /><br />I was in a porn chat when it happened. No joke. German porn chat called PRaO (porn request and offering) (long gone). Then someone mentioned the WTC and everyone turned on the TV, seeing the second plane hitting the tower live. That was shocking and very surreal. What followed was days and days of the same information and 24/7 special shows on the TV about it. I can not imagine how the media in the USA must have been.

A few years earlier they couldn&#039;t even hide a semen-stain on a pair of trousers, how the hell are they gonna orchestrate anything as intricate as the most often suggested by &#039;truthers&#039;. IF it was an inside job, it was only at the level of the US gvmnt asking the Saudis to finance it and OBL to organize it...<br /><br />I just the other month watched a good youtube series debunking the most common &#039;truther&#039; conspiracies. The channel is called Myles Power, or Mylespower1985, or some such. <br /><br />But they did indeed use it as an excuse to commit worse atrocities. Anyone who, in pain and grief, supported those atrocities should be ashamed, for you are exactly as bad as the original terrorists and the people egging them on. The only sensible course forward now is an end to violence, and to start setting an example of peace - for the memory of everyone who died; the people on 9/11, the Afghan innocents being murdered by drones, the Iraqis illegally invaded, and anyone else....

				The hijack crew was being followed by a Mossad team. Incidentally the Mossad team were arrested on 9/11 in NYC because they were filming and celebrating the the destruction, celebrating so much (singing and dancing for joy) a neighbour called the police and they were arrested.<br /><br />So no, I don&#039;t think the CIA were involved.

Note they used that language, which was technically correct, and not &quot;celebrating Mossad agents&quot;, which is more precise and more frightening and not anti-Semitic-sounding which &quot;dancing Jews&quot; does.<br /><br />

				no doubt about it, the us government had a lot to do with it (probably all). as for bush, he barely had the IQ to wipe his own ass so i don&#039;t think he had a huge role in it except to nod his head and say &quot;yeah lets do it&quot;<br /><br />building #7. a completely steel framed building. set on fire in certain parts around 9am that day. #7 wasn&#039;t touched by a plane, and neither tower 1 or 2 fell on it. the fires (which were relatively small for such a large building) went on burning for over 8 hours. around 5:30 pm #7 collapsed out of NOWHERE (a steel framed building like this has NEVER been destroyed by just fire). just watch the fuckin video of #7 falling down. NO WAY some small fires made that happen. it&#039;s simply not possible. so how did it happen? hmmm...<br /><br />i am an american, and i&#039;m not too proud to say it, but our government is absoultely fucked. we have been lied to our whole lives. and we&#039;re being lied to as we speak.

				The small fact what always is &quot;overlooked&quot;&nbsp; is that&nbsp; the insurance that was taken out 12 months before on a building that was supposedly infallible. Then you have the 3rd tower which the sheeple don&#039;t talk about, yes the small tower wedged in between the twins, that miraculously fell without nothing touching it. Then there&#039;s the fact that 3 weeks before the staged crashes, the building was subject to never before security checks. The skeptics think this is when the explosives where planted. Now somebody made a hell ov a bet on September 10th. They bet that the stocks would plummet, and lo and behold they did. These mysterious forecasts were not picked up on. And the winnings where not collected. Now you also have the pentagon. 6 CCTV cameras all captured&nbsp; the &quot;plane&quot; hitting the pentagon, only the whole wasn&#039;t big enough, you then had man in black type people picking up bits of the wreckage, since when do CIA operatives salvage scrap. The correct procedure would of been an investigation. Any way these facts coupled together all point to foul play. Oh the sudden death of a guy that was exposing these inaccuracies.

It&#039;s obvious we are run by power crazy rich bastards, Syria is another fear story so we have an excuse to go take their resources. I think it&#039;s all an attempt to control the world, I wish something monumental&nbsp; would happen, and every one would see what is happening. But i think the USA&#039;s reach will continue to extend until they either achieve world domination or china, russia etc gets fed up with our bullying and world war 3 goes off. I honestly think we&#039;re heading towards WW3

				Two books which everyone should read are Crossing the Rubicon by Michael C Ruppert and Another Nineteen: Investigating Legitimate 9/11 Suspects by Kevin Robert Ryan. I never questioned the government narrative regarding 9/11 until I stumbled upon Ruppert&#039;s book. Then my eyes started to open and I went deep into the rabbit hole of research.

				More proof that 43 was a genius mastermind, contrary to popular depictions of him. Imagine the nerve it must have taken to select thousands of people to participate in a conspiracy, and 12 years later, not a single one of them has spilled the beans. The statistical probability of that many people keeping a secret make it almost impossible, so the only explanation is immeasurable intelligence and cunning of a kind not seen before.<br /><br />It all points to the Bush Administration being by far the most sinister and intelligent group of people ever assembled in one room. The Gauleiter have nothing on them, obviously. I wonder if any of them will leave some clue or admission to be discovered after they have all died. For the sake of humanity, we should scrap elections and national governments and instead install 43&#039;s cabinet and advisers as a permanent world government, as they are clearly the smartest bunch of people who have ever lived and who can also tolerate eachother&#039;s company.<br /><br />SR has nothing on that bunch, it&#039;s SR to the power of SR in terms of complexity.<br /><br />

				I think that bin Laden did planned and carried out that attack. Then the US found out about it. And just let it happen and made it even worse by blowing the WTC demotion style. And the reason? To have the reasons. To have to reason for the patriot act. And to start those to horrible wars Iraq an Afghanistan. But any way that my 2 cents.<br /><br />Greeting to all<br /><br />PS its good to be back&nbsp; &nbsp;
