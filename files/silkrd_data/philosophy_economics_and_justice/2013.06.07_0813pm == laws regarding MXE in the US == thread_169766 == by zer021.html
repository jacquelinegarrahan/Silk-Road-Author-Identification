				say one was to get caught with mxe in the usa in a state with no specific laws against it what would happen?&nbsp; I know that federally at least it is not covered under the analogue act because ketamine is schedule 3.&nbsp; So would it be some sort of grey area drug law that you would be charged with.&nbsp; Or would it be some sort of problem with the FDA?

				From everything that I have been reading it is my belief that if one was to tell every person that they sold this too that it was not for human use, or maybe even put a label on the bags in which the caps or however it was sold, that technically you would not be breaking any laws.&nbsp; I&#039;m not entirely sure how well that would hold up in court but in theory it should work in accordance with the laws in place.&nbsp; I&#039;ll just keep researching I guess.&nbsp; The thing is is that I need some extra income and whatnot but have college grants and loans going on that if I were to be caught with any scheduled drug would go straight to shit and I would need to then pay them all back.&nbsp; So I&#039;m hoping to exploit this MXE loophole while it&#039;s open.&nbsp;

MXE, structurally speaking, is not similar enough to any one illicit dissociative to be considered an analog. In terms of effects, yes, it is supposed to be a ketamine-like substance, but even if it were to be considered a ketamine analog, it does not fall under the Analog Act. Ketamine is a Schedule III drug, and the Analog act only applies to Schedule I and II drugs.<br /><br />If your package of mxe is intercepted, they&#039;ll just think it&#039;s illegal, even if it isn&#039;t. Tell them to fuck off.

				You are right about telling them &quot;it&#039;s legal and to fuck off&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />My vehicle was searched during a traffic stop, the officer found a bunch of roaches in my ashtray.&nbsp; It so happens that they were &quot;spice&quot; roaches.&nbsp; What compound IDK.&nbsp; But anyways, the officer came out all happy cheering saying &quot;Score, I found some roaches&quot;.&nbsp; I immediately laughed it off explaining to him they were spice incense roaches and they were totally legal.&nbsp; As if the force was with me, suddenly a commercial for a sale on the stuff at a local famous head-shop nearby was playing in the officers vehicle LOL.&nbsp; He actually said he was going to field test it, I didn&#039;t see it, but I do know that he never said anything else of it afterwards and let me go.&nbsp; They were so happy and then shot down for their find they failed to notice i was drunk as fuck lol.&nbsp; I was actually on my way back home from buying some more high gravity beers (211 black).&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s South Carolina, USA pigs for you, dumb as fuck. <br /><br />

				Having been caught with phenazepam during a blackout, and considering the similarities between phenazepam and MXE legally speaking (schedule 3 VS the analog act), I got charged and then let off after they sent it to the state lab to get tested. I have a feeling the same would probably occur with MXE. It WILL field test for pcp, you will go to jail, it will be a pain in your ass, and you will not be sentenced.<br /><br />Cops are still cops, and bags of white powder are still bags of white powder.
