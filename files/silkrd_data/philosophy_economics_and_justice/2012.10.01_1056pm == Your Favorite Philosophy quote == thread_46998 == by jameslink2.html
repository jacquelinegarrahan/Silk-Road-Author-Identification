				Here&#039;s a nice, topical one for the road. <br /><br />&quot;We used to think that secrecy was perhaps the greatest enemy of democracy, and as long as there was no suppression or censorship, people could be trusted to make the informed decisions that would preserve our free society, but we have learned in recent years that the techniques of misinformation and misdirection have become so refined that, even in an open society, a cleverly directed flood of misinformation can overwhelm the truth, even though the truth is out there, uncensored, quietly available to anyone who can find it.&quot; -&nbsp; Daniel Dennett.

				The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, answered: <br /><br />&quot;Man.... Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.&quot;<br /><br />~ Dalai Lama<br /><br />

				These are some great quotes!<br /><br />Try this one, not really philosophy or is it?<br /><br />&quot;Live with a man 40 years. Share his house, his meals. Speak on every subject. Then tie him up, and hold him over the volcano&#039;s edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man.&quot; -- TV Show Firefly.<br /><br />I enjoy all of them, there are some I may not agree with but they all lead to one examining the statement on a deeper level and questioning what one truly believes.<br /><br />Keep them coming!<br />

				anybody body mention Bill Hicks yet?, some of my favorites..... <br /><br />They lie about marijuana. Tell you pot-smoking makes you unmotivated. Lie! When you&#039;re high, you can do everything you normally do just as well – you just realize that it&#039;s not worth the fucking effort. There is a difference.<br /><br />I quit smoking. It&#039;s very hard, but I&#039;m glad I did. I&#039;ll tell you, this war against drugs in the US is the reason I quit because I got too fuckin&#039; sick of being on the wrong side. The war against drugs, which actually is a war against civil rights, don&#039;t ever be fooled again. If they cared about us they&#039;d get rid of the number one drug which is cigarettes; kills more people than crack, coke, and heroin combined, times 100. Legal.<br /><br />Comedy is a double-edged sword; on 1 hand no 1 gives you any flak because...it&#039;s all a joke. On the other hand, it&#039;s not a joke<br /><br />My top spot, favorite of all time..<br /><br />The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it&#039;s real because that&#039;s how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it&#039;s very brightly colored, and it&#039;s very loud, and it&#039;s fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, &quot;Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?&quot; And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, &quot;Hey, don&#039;t worry; don&#039;t be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride.&quot; And we … kill those people. &quot;Shut him up! I&#039;ve got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.&quot; It&#039;s just a ride. But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok … But it doesn&#039;t matter, because it&#039;s just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It&#039;s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money. Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here&#039;s what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in peace.

				I love this thread :)<br /><br />Favorite one so far has been the bill hicks Ride quote, I remembered the first time I heard it and read it in his voice; literally gave me orgasmic chills up my spine for a good 8 seconds.<br /><br />&quot;Someone once told me the definition of Hell&quot;: The last day you have on this earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become&quot; -Anonymous<br /><br />&quot;Bring the mothafuckin ruckus!&quot;- Wu-Tang<br /><br />&quot;Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.” - Steve Jobs<br /><br />“Here is the test to find whether your mission on earth is finished. If you’re alive, it isn’t.” - Richard Bach<br /><br />“Man’s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions.” - Oliver Wendell Holmes<br /><br />&quot;The mind is its own place and in itself, can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.&quot; - John Milton<br /><br />

				This is more of a personal philosophy quote, but:<br />&quot;Omnia mea mecum porto&quot; -- Latin for &quot;All that is mine, I carry with me.&quot;<br /><br />The story (one version, at least) goes that the poet Vergil was on a sinking ship, and all the passangers were running around collecting their stuff. Vergil just walked calmly holding nothing. The captain asked him why he wasn&#039;t saving his belongings, and Vergil pointed to his head and answered the quote.

The question is, are you morally justified in doing so? Are they? How does one morally justify their actions? The typical libertarian response is that rights are derived from the concept of &quot;self-ownership&quot;. &quot;Property&quot;, is that which you transform in nature by mixing your labor with it. The &quot;right of property&quot; gives you exclusive use and control. No one has a higher claim on that which you transform/create, than you. No one has a right to take, agianst your will, that which you have created. <br /><br />

				Good evening, London. Allow me first to apologize for this interruption. I do, like many of you, appreciate the comforts of every day routine- the security of the familiar, the tranquility of repetition. I enjoy them as much as any bloke. But in the spirit of commemoration, thereby those important events of the past usually associated with someone&#039;s death or the end of some awful bloody struggle, a celebration of a nice holiday, I thought we could mark this November the 5th, a day that is sadly no longer remembered, by taking some time out of our daily lives to sit down and have a little chat. There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn&#039;t there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who&#039;s to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you&#039;re looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn&#039;t be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent. Last night I sought to end that silence. Last night I destroyed the Old Bailey, to remind this country of what it has forgotten. More than four hundred years ago a great citizen wished to embed the fifth of November forever in our memory. His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words, they are perspectives. So if you&#039;ve seen nothing, if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you then I would suggest you allow the fifth of November to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you to stand beside me one year from tonight, outside the gates of Parliament, and together we shall give them a fifth of November that shall never, ever be forgot. <br /><br />- V for Vendetta -

The factor that differentiates the two sets of behaviors is freedom of choice. The behaviors I defined as &quot;mere annoyances&quot; do not force you to do anything. However, the other behaviors seek to forcefully restrict your rights to free thinking and equality. I acknowledge that I left out the bit on &quot;in god we trust&quot; that is printed on all U.S. currency, because I really don&#039;t know what to think about the topic.

				&quot;Commerce is naturally adverse to all the violent passions; it loves to temporize, takes delight in compromise, and studiously avoids irritation. It is patient, insinuating, flexible, and never has recourse to extreme measures until obliged by the most absolute necessity. Commerce renders men independent of each other, gives them a lofty notion of their personal importance, leads them to seek to conduct their own affairs, and teaches how to conduct them well; it therefore prepares men for freedom, but preserves them from revolutions.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications, and to watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild. It would be like the authority of a parent, if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks on the contrary to keep them in perpetual childhood: it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided they think of nothing but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happiness: it provides for their security, foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances—what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living? Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range, and gradually robs a man of all the uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for these things: it has predisposed men to endure them, and oftentimes to look on them as benefits.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Democracy extends the sphere of individual freedom, socialism restricts it. Democracy attaches all possible value to each man; socialism makes each man a mere agent, a mere number. Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word: equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Born under another sky, placed in the middle of an always-moving scene, himself driven by the irresistible torrent which sweeps along everything that surrounds him, the American has no time to tie himself to anything; he grows accustomed to naught but change, and concludes by viewing it as the natural state of man; he feels a need for it; even more, he loves it: for instability, instead of occurring to him in the form of disasters, seems to give birth to nothing around him but wonders...&quot;<br /><br />-Tocqueville

				my signature is probably my favorite, but this here is a close runner up:<br /><br />&quot;And how must we be disappointed, when we learn, that this connexion, tie, or energy lies merely in ourselves, and is nothing but that determination of the mind, which is acquired by custom, and causes us to make a transition from an object to its usual attendant, and from the impression of one to the lively idea of the other? Such a discovery not only cuts off all hope of ever attaining satisfaction, but even prevents our very wishes; since it appears, that when we say we desire to know the ultimate and operating principle, as something which resides in the external object, we either contradict ourselves, or talk without a meaning.&quot;<br />-David Hume (i think it&#039;s from the treatise of human nature, but it may be from the enquiries. you should quickly read both if you haven&#039;t)<br /><br />and maybe the most important one of all:<br /><br />&quot;the unexamined life is one not worth living&quot; - socrates (or plato, really)

				&quot;Well I am certainly wiser than this man. It is only too likely that neither of us has any knowledge to boast of; but he thinks that he knows something which he does not know, whereas I am quite conscious of my ignorance. At any rate it seems that I am wiser than he is to this small extent, that I do not think that I know what I do not know. &quot; -Socrates<br /><br /><br />Knowing there are things you don&#039;t know is the beginning of wisdom!

				Every line from the Enchiridion is absolutely brilliant, but the first section contains my favorite lines: <br /><br />&quot;The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be harmed. &quot;
