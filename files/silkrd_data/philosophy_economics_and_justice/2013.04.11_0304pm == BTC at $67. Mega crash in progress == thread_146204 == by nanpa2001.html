				that sucks bro; really sorry for your loss.&nbsp; u must be super bummed, and I wish I could console you, but I do not have $8000 for ya&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />but anyway, this is not a &quot;crash.&quot;&nbsp; rather this is a &quot;correction.&quot;&nbsp; Honestly, weren&#039;t most of us saying that the price seemed super inflated when it went over $100 per coin?&nbsp; I know I was saying/thinking that.<br /><br />Someone posted this pic on btc-e last night when there were lots of people screaming &quot;buy buy buy&quot; at $190 per coin:&nbsp; http://i.imgur.com/FW34gwu.jpg<br /><br />While this is a humorous image, it really struck a chord with me as the part of the graph to the left of &quot;denial&quot; looked EXACTLY like the bitcoin rate chart up to that point.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I thought about it for an hour or so, came home from dinner and the price on mt gox was gyrating wildly between 160 and 180.&nbsp; I managed to sell off at 173 and am a very happy boy since i bought those coins at $78.&nbsp; It was a tough decision but when my wife asked me &quot;what&#039;s your gut telling you to do?&quot;&nbsp; my immediate response was &quot;its telling me to get the hell out of this.&quot;<br /><br />i&#039;m a small player though, much smaller than you.&nbsp; I just don&#039;t have the stomach yet for high stakes investing.&nbsp; but it looks like a correction to me.&nbsp; I can&#039;t imagine it will go lower than $20 per coin...after all, people still need their drugs and gambling.&nbsp; this is just gonna weed out the suited up investment brokers who were trying to get rich off our drug money.&nbsp; good riddance i say.&nbsp; within a day or two we can start comfortably using BTC as a currency again, as was intended

				They got as low as $60 USD? The weighted average on Mt.Gox is $160 USD right now and has been around that price since I got up early this morning.....It will climb again, this has happened SO many times where a huge crash happens and then literally less then a week later there up higher then they were before....

Collectors will now buy coins cheap and will hoard them. <br /><br />I am in belief with all this new press which seems daily, even the not so gifted tech people have now heard of bitcoin. Plus once thoe not so tech people figure out they can buy premium weed delivered anonymously or pilsl whatever the price will go even higher.<br /><br />If it werent for drug deals, money laundering, weapons trading, black ops funds, speculators, new bitcoin services popping up. I see growth and with that will come rise. When we started on SR it was 4 usd a coin makes me sad that i didnt respect them as I do now.<br /><br />plus would add that MT Gox fucked it all up they couldnt handle the mass investments, now they claim they can now. Like I said 90 days according to russian today bitcoin is going to be everywhere. thats enough for me to hold.<br /><br />If you are not even in a few weeks I would be surprised, keep in mind drug trade, casinos, etc need coins there is growing demand. <br /><br />I am not an expert, but my gut says once confidence comes back its going to rally to new highs. Dont let the bears scare you. <br /><br />

				Yeah, these fluctuations are temporary. Like someone a couple of posts back said, people gotta have their weed, pills, guns, hookers (do they take BTC yet? I hope so!) I am guessing that if you buy when the price is relatively low (US $50 or so each), hang on to them for a while until the price goes back up, then buy your weed, pills, etc. I got a good bargan on a couple of purchases, and still have a few BTC (not $8000 worth, though) in my wallet &amp; on account.
