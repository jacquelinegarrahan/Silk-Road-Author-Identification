				Hey! I know astrologers like to assign all things to the planets according to their qualities.<br />Herbs, flowers, and also brain active substances are ideal candidates.<br /><br />If you don&#039;t like astrology, please skip this thread.<br /><br />I hope we can collect some ideas in this thread, and I&#039;ll start with my own ones.<br /><br />Recently, I have been pondering on the correct assignments especially of psychedelics, it all didn&#039;t make sense until i got the great idea that psychedelics are never a single planet but actually provide a link between two planets (which describes their potency) .. more precisely, a link from neptune to one of the faster planets. <br /><br />Why Neptune ? With psychedelics you tap into cosmic-oceanic consciousness, making it more concrete and accessible for you. The 2nd planet describes the mode in which this happens.<br /><br />Psilocybine Mushrooms : Neptune - Moon <br />(you can shift realms and reside in them like on a platform. The experience is driven by your energy state and thoughts just follow. Shrooms also bear the moon signature: they like the wet, fast to grow, and fast to fade.)<br /><br />LSD : Neptune - Mercury <br />(mercury is pretty versatile, and since it&#039;s rather easy to shift focus on LSD it contains the possiblity of many other drugs in one way or the other)<br /><br />2C - Family : Neptune - Mars <br />(it&#039;s this shattering and pushy experience i had on 2C-B which made me think of mars.)<br /><br />Mescaline : Neptune - Sun<br />(I have not tried M. yet, but the reports are all about heat and lucidity. Cactus also bears the sun signature: they grow in the heat, adstringent taste, rays+stings)<br /><br />Other groups of brain-active chemicals, require a different category. <br />E.g. coffee perhaps Mars-Mercury. <br />MDMA perhaps Uranus-Moon but i&#039;m not sure, that&#039;s subject to update.<br />There&#039;s a chance Opiates, especially unaltered ones like morphine, might be pure Neptune, similar to poppy itself.<br />But i haven&#039;t got much experience here.<br />Anyone knows about Dissociatives, MDMA, Stimulants ?<br />

				I don&#039;t know about placing each individual drug into its own house or assigning them to planets but I can say that drugs as a category are ruled by Neptune or the 12th house of the unconscious and spirituality.

				&nbsp; I definitely agree with shrooms = moon, try taking them on the full moon closest to the solstice/equinox, near water, and you&#039;ll know what I mean, the energy is FANTASTIC, especially the harvest/fertility vibe to it, if you want to make a baby, that would be the way to go!&nbsp; Haven&#039;t really explored astrology in terms of planetary alignments, although I would expect cocaine/amphetamines would go with mars, MDMA with venus? I don&#039;t get as much of a feminine vibe off of MDMA, it seems androgynous, but venus is love...

				I agree that mushrooms have the Neptune-Moon energy, but also find that they have a Pluto energy too. The whole death-rebirth energy that all fungus taps into.<br /><br />Great thread! I&#039;ve been studying astrology for years and never seen anyone classify the planetary energies to specific drugs.<br />1 Karma for you aredhel!<br /><br />SS

				Venus (love), Saturn (the one who destroys to rebuild) and Pluto (the transformer) are missing.
