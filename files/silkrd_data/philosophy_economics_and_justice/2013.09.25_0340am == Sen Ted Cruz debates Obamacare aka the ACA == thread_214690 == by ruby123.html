				Anyone else watching this historic debate? I think the notion that individuals should have health care is commendable, my suspicion is raised when the state, under corporate duress is controlling the system.

				Socialized healthcare works great in the UK, and I&#039;m glad as I can hardly afford my bills too. So I have great peace-of-mind knowing that I&#039;m not going to end up bankrupt if I break a leg, need minor surgery, a course of chemo, or a mastectomy or summink. The government is already rinsing huge sums of money out of us all over the place, the least they can do is spend some of it in healing the people in the country paying that cash, rather than spend all of it on killing people overseas and subsidizing oil... Totally surprised more people in the US aren&#039;t fighting for something similar; &#039;crowed-pooled healthcare budgeting, with a single provider using the leverage to keep prices down? WTF would I want that - I wanna be charged through the ear on a one-one basis if anything happens to my health&#039;. Anyone from the US care to explain what the problem is with the idea?

				The problem is the private sector, specifically the healthcare and insurance industries, stand to lose a lot of money.&nbsp; When you have a lot of money you can spend a lot of money to sway public opinion.&nbsp; Once public opinion has shifted you can get a shill in office who will do all manner of crazy things to push for his (and by his I mean, really the private sectors) agenda.
