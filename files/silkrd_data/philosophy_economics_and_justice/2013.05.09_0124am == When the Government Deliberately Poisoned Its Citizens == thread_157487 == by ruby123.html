Though support for the act was rapidly waning, Republican presidential nominee Herbert Hoover still endorsed it as an &quot;experiment noble in purpose.&quot;<br /><br />Ironically, at that same time, chemists employed by the federal government were conducting experiments of a more disquieting nature. Enforcement of Prohibition was not going well at all. Citizens across the nation openly flouted the law, notorious crime syndicates ran rampant, and alcoholism rates were soaring. The Federal Government was aware that much of the available spirits originated from stolen industrial alcohol -- used, for example, in household cleaners, perfume, and cosmetics. Sixty million gallons were stolen each year to supply the nation&#039;s drinkers! So by 1926, government chemists concocted ten poisonous &quot;denaturing formulas&quot; to be added to the alcohols. These contained ominous chemicals like gasoline, benzene, cadmium, nicotine, ether, formaldehyde, chloroform, and acetone. Prohibition advocates and officials believed that if they made the alcohol undrinkable, imbibers would be forced to abandon their immoral habits. The government defended this effort as &quot;law enforcement.&quot; In truth, it was mass poisoning.<br />In 1927, the pioneering forensic scientist Alexander Gettler, a toxicologist for the City of New York, reported that in the previous year 1,200 New Yorkers had been sickened or blinded by the government&#039;s poisoned alcohol, and another 400 had died. Even before these perturbing statistics came to light, Gettler&#039;s boss, the now legendary medical examiner Charles Norris, was already incensed with the Federal Government&#039;s actions:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The government knows it is not stopping drinking by putting poison in alcohol... yet it continues its poisoning processes, heedless of the fact that people determined to drink are daily absorbing that poison. Knowing this to be true, the United States government must be charged with the moral responsibility for the deaths that poisoned liquor causes, although it cannot be held legally responsible.&quot;<br /><br />Most of the denaturing formulas&#039; deadly power came not from the myriad additives, but from the simple supplementation of more alcohol. That&#039;s because the type utilized here was methanol, sharply dissimilar to the more benign ethanol that we&#039;re accustomed to today. If ingested, as little as 10 mL of methanol can result in blindness through the destruction of the optic nerve. About 100 mL is lethal.<br /><br />The perniciousness of methanol arises from how it&#039;s broken down by the body. While the liver&#039;s enzymes quickly convert ethanol into acetaldehyde and then acetyl -- the latter of which can be used by the body for energy -- methanol, when broken down, turns into formaldehyde and formic acid, two substances quite unkind to living human tissue. Formic acid actually exists naturally in bee and ant venom.<br /><br />Gettler and Norris weren&#039;t the only people infuriated with Washington&#039;s abhorrent poisoning policy. Newspapers across the nation decried the government as a mass poisoner and &quot;an accessory to murder.&quot; The collective rage was fueled by a glaring fact: the policy primarily affected the poor. While common citizens literally drank themselves to death on cheap, toxic liquors in backroom speakeasies, the wealthy enjoyed quality cocktails and spirits derived from ethanol, served at colorful parties and luxurious gatherings. <br /><br />Herbert Hoover, who, as you might recall, labeled prohibition as a &quot;noble experiment,&quot; was in the latter classification. In fact, when serving as the Secretary of Commerce, he would regularly stop by the Belgian Embassy -- technically on foreign soil and thus exempt from Prohibition -- and enjoy some of their fine spirits. They were imported, naturally.<br /><br />Author&#039;s Note: This piece was inspired and primarily sourced from Deborah Blum&#039;s The Poisoner&#039;s Handbook, which is one of the finest works of historical journalism and nonfiction storytelling that I have read.

				They poison the water too, i try not to touch it if it isn&#039;t spring or reverse osmosis..&nbsp; <br /><br />i&#039;m pretty sure the gov is also in collusion with the medical industry, involved in some huge experiment to see how much life they can squeeze out of humans..&nbsp; gov would much rather use cheap petro chemicals instead of anything natural.&nbsp; as humans become more plastic, the kings who sit atop government seem to build taller and taller castles; which will eventually fall over -crushing everything beneath them.<br />

				yea doesn;t surprise me.. Ever hear about the one when the CIA spiked an entire cities food with LSD as an experiment?<br /><br />clearnet http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7415082/French-bread-spiked-with-LSD-in-CIA-experiment.html<br /><br />French bread spiked with LSD in CIA experiment<br />A 50-year mystery over the &#039;cursed bread&#039; of Pont-Saint-Esprit, which left residents suffering hallucinations, has been solved after a writer discovered the US had spiked the bread with LSD as part of an experiment.<br /><br />An American investigative journalist has uncovered evidence suggesting the CIA peppered local food with the hallucinogenic drug LSD <br />Henry Samuel in Paris 7:00AM GMT 11 Mar 2010<br />In 1951, a quiet, picturesque village in southern France was suddenly and mysteriously struck down with mass insanity and hallucinations. At least five people died, dozens were interned in asylums and hundreds afflicted.<br />For decades it was assumed that the local bread had been unwittingly poisoned with a psychedelic mould. Now, however, an American investigative journalist has uncovered evidence suggesting the CIA peppered local food with the hallucinogenic drug LSD as part of a mind control experiment at the height of the Cold War.<br />The mystery of Le Pain Maudit (Cursed Bread) still haunts the inhabitants of Pont-Saint-Esprit, in the Gard, southeast France.<br />On August 16, 1951, the inhabitants were suddenly racked with frightful hallucinations of terrifying beasts and fire.<br />One man tried to drown himself, screaming that his belly was being eaten by snakes. An 11-year-old tried to strangle his grandmother. Another man shouted: &quot;I am a plane&quot;, before jumping out of a second-floor window, breaking his legs. He then got up and carried on for 50 yards. Another saw his heart escaping through his feet and begged a doctor to put it back. Many were taken to the local asylum in strait jackets.<br />Related Articles<br />&#039;What was it that turned me into a monster – a ranting, raving lunatic?’ 24 Feb 2013<br />Time magazine wrote at the time: &quot;Among the stricken, delirium rose: patients thrashed wildly on their beds, screaming that red flowers were blossoming from their bodies, that their heads had turned to molten lead.&quot;<br />Eventually, it was determined that the best-known local baker had unwittingly contaminated his flour with ergot, a hallucinogenic mould that infects rye grain. Another theory was the bread had been poisoned with organic mercury.<br />However, H P Albarelli Jr., an investigative journalist, claims the outbreak resulted from a covert experiment directed by the CIA and the US Army&#039;s top-secret Special Operations Division (SOD) at Fort Detrick, Maryland.<br />The scientists who produced both alternative explanations, he writes, worked for the Swiss-based Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company, which was then secretly supplying both the Army and CIA with LSD.<br />Mr Albarelli came across CIA documents while investigating the suspicious suicide of Frank Olson, a biochemist working for the SOD who fell from a 13th floor window two years after the Cursed Bread incident. One note transcribes a conversation between a CIA agent and a Sandoz official who mentions the &quot;secret of Pont-Saint-Esprit&quot; and explains that it was not &quot;at all&quot; caused by mould but by diethylamide, the D in LSD.<br />While compiling his book, A Terrible Mistake: The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA&#039;s Secret Cold War Experiments, Mr Albarelli spoke to former colleagues of Mr Olson, two of whom told him that the Pont-Saint-Esprit incident was part of a mind control experiment run by the CIA and US army.<br />After the Korean War the Americans launched a vast research programme into the mental manipulation of prisoners and enemy troops.<br />Scientists at Fort Detrick told him that agents had sprayed LSD into the air and also contaminated &quot;local foot products&quot;.<br />Mr Albarelli said the real &quot;smoking gun&quot; was a White House document sent to members of the Rockefeller Commission formed in 1975 to investigate CIA abuses. It contained the names of a number of French nationals who had been secretly employed by the CIA and made direct reference to the &quot;Pont St. Esprit incident.&quot; In its quest to research LSD as an offensive weapon, Mr Albarelli claims, the US army also drugged over 5,700 unwitting American servicemen between 1953 and 1965.<br />None of his sources would indicate whether the French secret services were aware of the alleged operation. According to US news reports, French intelligence chiefs have demanded the CIA explain itself following the book&#039;s revelations. French intelligence officially denies this.<br />Locals in Pont-Saint-Esprit still want to know why they were hit by such apocalyptic scenes. &quot;At the time people brought up the theory of an experiment aimed at controlling a popular revolt,&quot; said Charles Granjoh, 71.<br />&quot;I almost kicked the bucket,&quot; he told the weekly French magazine Les Inrockuptibles. &quot;I&#039;d like to know why.&quot;

				LEts not forget Paraquat - ruins weed plants but also causes birth defects, possible carcinogen..... Agent Orange , sure it kills everything it touches but its safe for our GIs to handle --There are unsubstantiated ( at this time ) rumors and reports that ?some? government agency developed crack and purposely flooded the Black neighborhoods with massive amounts of coke&nbsp; to make it cheap and fuel it into epidemic proportions.While the $ went into some type of black budget.--look up depleted uranium bullets ( for armor piercing ) that the US scattered all across Iraq&nbsp; without even the thought of cleaning them up. Or some of the crap our government lets monsanto do over and over.<br /><br />I like to think that most people in the government are&nbsp; trying to make things better- road to hell is blah blah blah

				It&#039;s happening right now! Ever notice there&#039;s a lot more clouds than usual? <br /><br />A lot more &#039;Contrails&quot; - So-called Vapor Trails from planes? - That&#039;s the current US Govt program called HAARP. <br /><br />They are spraying Barium across our skies DAILY. - I&#039;ve always been a sky watcher, and in my 40&#039;s now, it&#039;s very noticeable. <br /><br />It&#039;s not a conspiracy theory, the HAARP program actually exists! - The Barium suspended in the clouds, is used to bounce radio waves off of, across this whole grid over the United States, for among other things, drone surveillance of every inch of land. Interception of wireless communications, as well as any others. (HAM radios, etc)<br /><br />Don&#039;t believe me? Look it up!<br /><br />http://artificialclouds.com/<br /><br />Oh yeah, and what happens to that now &quot;radioactive barium&quot; - why it falls to the earth. Ever notice after a rain storm, especially a brief one, that your car is covered in dust, when in the old days, it used it actually clean the dirt off? <br /><br />The next bright blue clear morning you have, look up into the sky, and look for a few jet trails. - Not a cloud in the sky. Except those pesky trails. You&#039;ll start to see quite a few. - Next thing you&#039;ll know, perhaps around lunch time, is that it&#039;s suddenly cloudy! - Weatherman predicted clear skies. Then by sunset the sun comes peering through a ceiling of cloud. <br /><br />Maybe I&#039;m just a crazy old drug addict, but at least give it a try and tell me some of these things aren&#039;t true.

				The US government had prior knowlegde about the attack on Pearl Harbor. That is what the main targets the carriers where out on patrol. But they just let it happen so that the had a good reason to enter the War.<br /><br />So the same thing may be true about 9/11 they knew that there was an attack coming did not nothing to stop it, <br />the CIA may even have infiltrated some of the Al-Qaeda cell. And helped them. On You tube I ones saw a video where when the towers got hit some Isreali where cheering and celebrating.<br />Then how about that one time when a US destroyer patrolling the cost of Egypt the Isreali air force send some attack jets to sink it. So that the later could blaim Egypt for the attack and start an US backed war.<br /><br />The state you be there for the people like a mother is there for her child and not the other way around

				I just wanna throw something into the conversation on the &quot;Government&quot; and its &quot;cruelty/evil&quot;.<br /><br />I am turned off of debate when people use titles like this one: When the Government Deliberately Poisoned Its Citizens. I understand and acknowledge that the &quot;government&quot; has done many terrible things since the beginning of governments. What&#039;s critical for the clarity of debate is that &quot;governments&quot; are people. People are often evil out of ignorance or justification of the means.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: various</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_road_to_hell_is_paved_with_good_intentions<br /><br />When people are faced with difficult problems, especially moral impasses, they often make morally impossible decisions. Many rulers follow a philosophy that could be deemed Kantian: The Universal Imperative... &quot;If everyone did that, then the world would go to hell in a hand basket.&quot; Prohibition is an essential history lesson. The ginger root that caused blindness was also pretty horrific;--not to mention the lye added to moonshine, in addition to methyl alcohol also. These are atrocious records of human corruption, both morally and financially.<br /><br />It should be duly noted that today&#039;s government is not the government of Hoover (Hoover blankets/hoover towns/hoover flag), Truman, FDR, etc... Each generation has their unique problems, often just problems of old with a modern twist or some linguistically genius euphemism.<br /><br />+1 To the OP for keeping history alive.<br />-1 To the OP for not recognizing this as a human problem, instead of a &quot;government&quot; problem.<br /><br />Remember the wisdom of Lord Acton.
