				10 years ago when I started noticing airplanes spraying the sky with chemicals while the media and governments keep acting like they dont see any trails in the sky..<br /><br />So I always blamed the media and fear for it all that makes people dont care since they dont think what they do matters.. And when its all said and the planet is destroyed then using excuses like -but everyone else did it thats why I did it and ignored that it will lead to my death if i do not wake up and smell the freedom already..<br /><br />Then I realised that people are sending drugs anonymosly all over the world to avoid the risks of a war that could be ended if the use of btc and SR was used for world peace and infosharing instead of drugs-sharing-only..<br /><br />Btc and Sr has so many posetive possebilities if used right. And I aint seeing much of them recently.<br /><br />So whats your deeper views on the meaning of the btc and Sr?<br /><br />It feels like its &quot;the freedomwill of the people&quot; that created the tools for freedom by sharing truths anonymosly..<br /><br />OR its the criminal gangs that used SR and Btc to give you the option to spend your fiatmoney on any kind of substances that keep your hands away from figuring out some clever ways on how to use the tools on how to create world peace instead of using it to be a part of a silly war..<br />&nbsp;Lets end ALL the wars with btc and Sr instead of using it to play noobish in the game of life using drugs anonymously.<br /><br />This will be a huge and great idea even after the economy collapses.. you will still know that btc and SR could have been used to spread info on a global scale and that would put a stop to world wars economic collapses since none would fight a unjust war and none would follow in a economy that creates slavery by having buildt-in inflasion.<br /><br />Until we use Sr and BTc for its true spiritual purposes then I guess we can discuss what the purpose was of btc and SR?<br /><br />Was it the peoples cry for freedom that created BTC and SR, or was it the criminal warmongers that used internet to let you get your hands on all drugs so you stay out of trying to end the war on drugs that enables children to buy hard drugs easily?<br /><br />After its all said and done I guess it does not matter only what info was pushed really mattered in theese last days. And its a induvidual thing you cant use excuses like &quot;everyone else did it&quot; when the planet is destroyed. We are all grownups but sometimes it feels like the rolemodels in the governments aint really living up to the promise of a bright future since they have been giving promises of that since tousands of years ago and its fake love thats getting visible now when its getting more and more obvious that humanity has pulled the rug from under its own feet by being controlled by punkass slavemasters that used humanity for slavereasons to invent technology that would succefully turn a human into a robotslave. And we are all here now, at the point of slaves wanting to turn themselves into robots because how could we ever get slaveryspots if we dont turn ourself into robots.<br /><br />Shure both Sr and Btc is a part of this technology that humanity was used to invent for the slaveoowners that now is standing and telling us that there is no slavery and there is a bright future comin up just like the politicians promised.. <br /><br />Its a sour piece of the apple and it got a big worm in it folks.<br /><br />Whats your point of view on my point of views?<br /><br />Much love and you know whats up in theese last days

				Let me say that I have been listening to Tsarion talk about the origins of evil for around 18 hours now so its a massive topic and long story..<br /><br />Basicly, alien giants fled to Earth and got stuck on the planet when higher powers put a forcefield around the planet to keep them here.. So the aliens took the neadertahl and made humanity from it.. But the first version that was created did not wanna be slaves so they created a white dumbed down version that would be able to be slaves.. The original people still visited Atlantis and teling the slaves that they dont have to be slaves if they just live in nature. The white men (Adam) said noway we got everything we need and slavemaster provides for us after we have done the job for slavemaster.. While Eve said -lets hear them out. They say that women has not beeing forgiven for that until theese days. For feeling that nature is truth and there is no reason for being a slave since nature provides for everyone.<br /><br />I am white myself but I still say its all love when I call you slaves since this slavery goes way back and it has come to the endparts now, so are you a part of it or did you detach from whats destroying the planet?<br /><br />Thats the only thing higher powers wanna know from you, I guess..<br /><br />They basicly created humanity to be slaves to invent their lost technology and now they are all done here and humanity was used for its purpose and now when the technology is invented and some slaves wanna become robots..<br /><br />It just feels like they did all check-mate move on humanity and the planet since humanity was created in a lab and then enslaved to invent technology very very fast and now the technology is invented, the planet is destroyed and some human slaves wanna turn themselves into robots since they dont know about modern slavery yet..<br /><br />We even use Btc and Sr for sharing drugs anonymously because we lack the intelligence for sharing info about the wars anonymously.<br /><br />What was all this technology good for folks?<br /><br />The planet is dying and none is getting out alive unless you personaly detach from the destruction of mother Earth and then higher powers will help you out when the times come for the judgement.<br /><br />To me its like seeing all of you being afraid of the slavemasters still yet their time is up they are just putting on that fakesmile since they are soul-less and they want you to join the soul-less beasts.<br /><br />Its all love to talk about that the white skincolor comes from evil aliens removing melanin from the original DNA to enable a dumbed down slaverace get to believe they are in power.<br /><br />Today its all spread out but the slavegenes is probably the dominant but that original DNA is always there in the core so it does not matter how much layers of fakeness put on top of it.<br /><br />Most people are docile slaves and they dont see any reasons in stopping to be a part of the destruction of the planet in other words dont pull the carpet from under your own feets.<br /><br />Whats your point of view on my point of views?<br /><br />Much love

				Loved your video, however your lyrics mean we are particles of neurons and electrons but we should not forget we each are a celestial body of a kind.Look at our bones and tooth&#039;s&nbsp; and nails.<br /><br /><br />I see your point here, meaning of btc and online anonymity but how does that compare with any spiritual&nbsp; meaning?<br /><br /><br />About our DNA being flashed with something else &#039;fake&#039; by a higher Entity does not make sense.<br />They are above our comprehension for a reason being they are of higher dimesion, why wud they then play with mother Nature ?<br />Then we need to clarify what higher dimension mean; my thought&#039;s it&#039;s higher coz it simply deserves to be.
