				*I think this is the right forum for this, its kind of philosophical...*<br /><br />So I know from firsthand experience that LSD can be used as an agent of change in rebooting habitual cycles and attitudes. I learned a great deal of patience from this sacred compound as well as changed several behaviors that were preventing me from having a more fulfilling life. That said I am hoping to soon use this life-changing molecule to affect one of the hardest changes I&#039;ve ever attempted: quitting smoking.<br /><br />I have tried quitting smoking (tobacco) many times for several years but I always keep coming back to it in times of stress. My idea is to take a long hike with a few friends, set up tents, and drop 2-300ug. Then to meditate through most of the peak focusing on the good that will come from being a non-smoker. <br /><br />Maybe some moonlight hike adventures after that, who knows... <br /><br />My question is, has anybody here used Lucy to help break the cigarette addiction? How well did it work, any tips? Also I&#039;m planning on not smoking for a day before, since I can go about a day without smoking if I really try. Thinkin maybe I should bring a few to throw into the campfire as a symbolic gesture, ridding myself of them while concentrating on my goal...<br /><br />Anyways, thanks in advance for any feedback ^.^ safe travels on the road.

				The last time I tried Ketamine, It completely got rid of my desire to take my prescription meds that I was on. The whole K hole makes you think and review what you&#039;re doing, and how to improve.<br />You should try it :)<br />~D

				In Sweden where I live, there was a documentary on tv about experiments on exactly this, 2 people got the chance to test LSD with the goal of quitting to use the pillmedecines they was very addicted to, and I remember them saying that they could not smoke a cigarette after the LSD experience, and they cut down on their pillabuse instantly, they &quot;needed&quot; only half the pills after the LSD.<br /><br />I would recommend saving your money and activating your third eye instead since LSD is probably forcing your third eye to create some DMT and other substances, but meditating enables you to be concious in the other dimensions with your astralbody that is a energybody on top of your fysical body.<br /><br />My third eye created DMT on demand so i dont have to buy LSD or DMT ever again, I have tried to use musrooms to activate my third eye but it was impossible.<br /><br />The only thing you need to do is to write it down that you want to activate your third eye and you want to remember your dreams and be concious in your dreams, as long as you&nbsp; write it so you can see the words, youre manifesting it from higher dimensions and if and when you activate your third eye you will be able to manifest anything you want by just manifesting it in the higher dimensions and then after a while it will be moved down into this dimensions.<br /><br />People have done it with money and everything, but it has to be what your hart wants and you have to be very specific on what you want for it to be able to work. And you cant doubt it either but you probably wont when you have experienced being concious in other dimensions.

				I have done a lot of meditation and I have experienced much of what you mention. But the cigarettes are such a deep rutted habbit in my mind that I think it will take the addition of the extreme and quite sudden perceptual shift that comes with chillin with Lucy. I will admit I dont have the ability to really conciously control my pineal gland/related structures like that. Kudos to you, that is a true accomplishment. For me tho, I can&#039;t make myself trip at will and I want to quit smoking NOW... it would likely take me years to gain that kind of control and I have a very busy life. So if it works for me its not even close to a waste of money - bout 20 bucks and never buy cigs again? Thats 150 bucks a month saved, a very good deal IMO. But even if I dont, Lucy is always a good deal as far as im concerned - she is by far my favorite molecule, though I exercise a lot of discipline in how frequent I drop and in what situations. So even if I dont quit, I got an acid trip ^.^ which is worth more than I spend on her anyway. <br /><br />Thanks for the idea though ;-)

				The key is to manifest it, you need to write it down so you can see the words, then youre higher self will get to work and make things happen for you from higher dimensions..<br /><br />I was told this a couple of peoples but I did not believe it fully, then a guy wrote to me about him writing down that he wanna remember his dreams and astraltravel, and the same night he was on a very beautiful planet somewhere in the universes.<br /><br />So I tried it myself and ofcourse I woke up outside of my fysical body 2 nights after writing everything down, I woke up above my fysical body and noticed it was foggy like something was on fire in the apartment, and then someones said something about smoke or fire so I flew over one or two people in my bed, i have no idea why they was in my bed talkin about smoke and stuff maybe they was lost stoner ghosts I dont know yet.. And I flew into the kitchen and looked into the owen, then I started to become more concious and I really started thinking more clearly about if there really is a fire in here, then I jolted back into my fysical body in my bed and I jumped up a half meter above the bed just because of the shock since I thought I was standing in the kitchen when I flew back into my fysical body..<br /><br />So if you use this info and manifest that you wanna stop smokin, activate your third eye or maybe remember your dreams.. Write everything down and watch the magic happen.<br /><br />thats the secret they know, they even gets children to manifest what slavejob they wanna do when they grow up, write it down and manifest it kids since you all wanna be slaves later in life said the slaveowners who knows exactly what the power of manifesting is.

				From what I know, there are two things to addiction:<br /><br />1. Physical addiction, your body being in need of nicotine. It takes about 10 days of being &quot;clean&quot; for your body to recover, but you can&#039;t stop using every drug cold-turkey so it could take you a little longer when you taper off. So you can get rid of the physical addicition in about 10 days. But if that was all, you could just use nicotine pills or patches, but everyone knows that doesn&#039;t work..<br /><br />2. Psychiological addiction. Your brain didn&#039;t just make the positive &quot;smoke - nicotine&quot; association, but you likely also started connecting to other positive experiences. Smoke after sex, smoke after winning a prize, smoke after receiving your paycheck, smoke after dinner.. Drugs like LSD are possibly able to provide you with the insight that all those things were good, with or without smoking.<br /><br />A Dutch stand-up comedian once joked that we need to make negative associations. Ads for smoking on TV with smoking linedancers. Whenever you see someone trying to light up, spit them in the face! Making negative associations. Perhaps you could actually do that. Maybe find some really disgusting drink and force yourself to drink that whenever you smoke, getting your brain to make the association between smoking and that disgusting taste.

These appear the least on the boxes since manufacturers are aware of this.<br /><br />The text however is too abstract. And someone who considers to start smoking would just read &quot;smoking kills&quot; and think &quot;right, this is the good stuff!&quot;. I know I do. In Canada they started putting nice photos on the boxes, in color. Blackened lungs, destroyed organs, a man and a woman in bed each looking the other way with a note on impotency.. So far the statistics are saying the visual impulse really helps.<br /><br />Negative association works, but you have to do it properly. Just a plain text saying &quot;smoking kills&quot; is not enough.

				I quit smoking while taking a lot of psychedelics, LSD among them.<br /><br />What worked for me was the patch, picking up a new hobby that engaged my body and my mind at the same time, and most importantly, giving myself permission to relax without the &#039;smoke break&#039;.<br /><br />Good luck.

				The thing is if you really want to stop smoking - just do it!<br />I stopped once for 3 weeks from 100 to 0 and just began smoking again because I wanted to smoke weed and didn&#039;t want to smoke pure bong heads. Also smoking weed with being a tobacco smoker is a little bit &quot;hard&quot; in my opinion.<br />All these patches and E-Cigs and whatnot are not needed, in my opinion. Don&#039;t waste your money on it, just stop and you will see it is much easier than you thought. Just stop for 3-4 days and you will be fine, after 2 weeks it will be like you never smoked, addiction wise.<br /><br />A tip: try to get into situations that would make you smoke, like after a meal or after having sex, and then don&#039;t smoke, if you do this a couple of times you will fight the conditioning that you have and it will be a lot easier to avoid smoking in general.

				The patch is so you can go more than three weeks while breaking the psychological aspect of the addiction which is really the hardest part for many people.&nbsp; Yeah withdrawals suck but it&#039;s the urge to light up every time you drink, get high, get stressed, after you eat, while you&#039;re driving, etc. etc.&nbsp; That&#039;s the shit I needed help with and I certainly didn&#039;t want to be breaking the psychological habit while going through physical withdrawals too.<br /><br />You&#039;re right, they&#039;re not *needed* and I&#039;m not a fan of E-Cigs because they really don&#039;t help you quit.&nbsp; But the patch, you can get a two week supply of generic Wal-Mart patches for twenty bucks, which most places in the U.S. that&#039;s two weeks of nicotine for the price of three to five packs of smokes.&nbsp; Four boxes of patches gives you two months of breaking the habit before you have to deal with full on physical withdrawal and by that point you&#039;ll be down to the equivalent of five smokes a day, which is a much easier withdrawal to go through than going from 20 to 0.&nbsp; Plus if you have health insurance you can probably get it covered (paying for someone to quit smoking is much cheaper than paying for lung cancer, emphysema, or even just the number of extra colds and sore throats smokers get).<br /><br />Anyway, I do agree with you about motivation being really key.&nbsp; If you want to quit you&#039;ll figure it out and quit.&nbsp; But I would suggest that anyone that&#039;s serious about it not feel like they have to do it on their *own*.&nbsp; If you want help, rather that&#039;s from a patch, gum, or just a support group for people quitting smoking, get help.
