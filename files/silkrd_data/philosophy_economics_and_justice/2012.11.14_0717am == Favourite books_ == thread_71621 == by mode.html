				Thought I&#039;d share two of my all time favourite books, and maybe get some feedback from other people about their choices :)<br /><br />Living Energies (The life and work of Viktor Schauberger) - Callum Coats<br /><br />An indepth look into the life and works of one of the greatest scientists and minds of our time. All his inventions and theories (water/fluid vortices, turbine engine, refinement of water, vortex propulsion) were derived from nature and his work was unparalleled. Right up there with Einstein, the perfect complement.<br /><br />http://www.scribd.com/doc/28717669/Viktor-Schauberger-Living-Energies<br /><br /><br />Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain - Sheila Ostrander &amp; Lynn Schroeder<br /><br />This book blew me away. Amazing investigation into Russian (and others from the Eastern Bloc) parapsychological research post cold war. The psy research undertaken at the time was widely regarded as &#039;normal&#039; in society, with schools that people could actually attend. The experiments that are written of in the book, were all openly/publicly documented, and will twist your mind. Also explains soooo much about about the relations between certain countries, and at times takes a rather sinister tone.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Psychic-Discoveries-Behind-Iron-Curtain/dp/0137320817

				Never even heard of Viktor Shauberger... hrm.&nbsp; My apologies, but regardless of what Sheila Ostrander &amp; Lynn Schroeder say, I don&#039;t believe in such things... and don&#039;t care enough about history to learn why an entire country was silly enough to.&nbsp; I&#039;ll toss a couple of suggestions back at you though :)<br /><br />Favorite novel is Snow Crash, by Neal Stephenson.&nbsp; If you like cyberpunk and haven&#039;t read it, you&#039;re missing out.<br />Another favorite is Vurt, by Jeff Noon.&nbsp; Cyberpunk-ish too.<br /><br />If you&#039;re bored without your drugs, give &#039;em a look.

As far as my favourite book goes, it depends on what type of genre. Haruki Murakami is an amazingly talented writer whose novels are just stunning. A particular favourite of his is called &#039;Kafka on the Shore&#039;, I think I&#039;ve read it around 4 times now and each time interpreted certain bits in different ways, a book that keeps giving for sure! Another long time favourite, Kundera&#039;s exisential novel &#039;The Unberable Lightness of Being&#039;. I like war literature too, very powerful. Pat Barkers Regeneration trilogy is the first that springs to mind.

				I&#039;m an old Tolkien-head, I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll be shocked to hear.<br />Much love still for Gibson&#039;s Neuromancer. I feel like I know every sentence of that book.<br />The Algebraist by Iain M Banks.<br />Confessions of an Economic Hit Man by John Perkins is quite the eye-opener.<br /><br />

				Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />Shantaram is a 2003 novel by Gregory David Roberts, in which a convicted Australian bank robber and heroin addict who escaped from Pentridge Prison flees to India. <br />The novel is commended by many for its vivid portrayal of tumultuous life in Bombay.<br /><br />A really gripping and enlightening read.<br /><br />Secondly, everything by William Gibson. Burning Chrome being my favourite.<br /><br />For laughs, Terry Pratchett&#039;s Discworld series.

				Recently, I read &quot;Outliers&quot; by Malcolm Gladwell.&nbsp; It was very enlightening.<br /><br />Fiction - I read Life of Pi again because the movie is out.&nbsp; I think it shows the incredible power of the human mind.&nbsp; I read it first about 6-8 years ago and it really stuck with me.<br /><br />I am currently reading Spillover about viral epidemics (such as Ebola).&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty good, but not my fav.<br /><br />One of my all time favorites is Catch 22.&nbsp; Strangely enough, I can&#039;t even finish any of&nbsp; Joseph Heller&#039;s other books - they are awful.<br /><br />Lastly, I loved The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements by Eric Hoffer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I love to read, but wish I had a better memory.&nbsp; Too much weed! Ha!

				My favorite books haven&#039;t changed in years... I really love The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton as well as Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.<br /><br />And this may not be the most popular opinion, but I really love young adult fiction books, particularly trilogies. Absolutely loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, and my all time favorite series is The Maze Runner by James Dashner. A good book is a good book no matter what age group it is targeted at. :)<br /><br />I actually haven&#039;t read anything in months though, probably since summer. Been super busy, but excited to read this new book I just picked up, The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom.<br /><br />

				Agree with Neal Stephenson fans. A friend of mine who knows my tastes recently couldn&#039;t believe I&#039;d never read any. Started with Snow Crash then Anathem then Diamond age and Reamde. I couldn&#039;t get into Crytptonomicon or Quicksilver either.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I tend towards non fiction these days<br />Selfish Gene - Richard Dawkins<br />Red Queen - Matt Ridley...... both about genetics and evolution<br /><br />1491 by Charles c Mann<br />Comanche by T R Feuerenbach.....&nbsp; both about Indians but very different.<br /><br />Demon Haunted world by Carl Sagan<br />Bad Science by Ben Goldacre...&nbsp; &nbsp; hoping to get follow up &quot;Bad&nbsp; Pharma&quot; for Christmas<br /><br />Junky - by Williamn Burroughs..... pisses on anything Kerouac wrote although I wouldn&#039;t bother with any of his later &quot;cut up &quot; books<br /><br />I just got round to reading all the Dark Tower books by Stephen King. I read all his other stuff, even the shit ones but I never fancied this. I was wrong. It&#039;s fucking epic.<br /><br />Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel by Susanah Clarke is a good read but a bit of a slog.&nbsp; It&#039;s got fairies in it but the full size baby stealing, make you dance in the snow as they bathe in your blood type.<br /><br />If this is a man<br />The Periodic Table.... Two books by the Holocausrt surviving chemist Primo Levi. The first tells of his experience and is truthful and horrible and uplifting at the same time.<br />The Periodic Table is a series of short stories based on chemical elements. It&#039;s genius<br /><br />The Wasp Factory.&nbsp; &nbsp;Iain Banks.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A dark murderous tale with a twist<br /><br />Ghost Stories of MR James, particularly &quot;o whistle and I&#039;ll come for you&quot;<br />Terrifying.<br /><br />The Road by Cormac McCarthy. Not seen the film but I stayed up all night reading the book in one sitting and literally sobbed uncontrollably at the end. Not cos I was sad but moved.<br />&nbsp;<br />AND its clearly a nuclear winter. Sick of critics describing it as &quot; after some unspecified environmental disaster&quot;. In a flashback he looks out of the window at night and sees a couple of huge flashes on horizon. He starts filling the bath. His wife says &quot;why you having a bath&quot; &quot;I&#039;m not&quot;<br /><br />....it&#039;s called writing!<br />That&#039;s a few to be going on with<br />

				100 years of solitude by Gabriela Garcia Marquez is at the top of my list. Magical Realism at its best.<br />Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson is also up there. Being an addict reading this book was like watching myself on a bender and being able to laugh out loud about it. <br />Also anything by Kurt Vonnegut.<br />

Turns out it&#039;s &quot;based on a true story&quot; - more like a gonzo account of what really happened. I think if I had read it with that in mind, it wouldn&#039;t have tainted the reading experience for me. <br /><br />Terry Pratchett&#039;s Discworld is brilliant! A true master of the English language. <br /><br />My all-time favourite is probably Cat&#039;s Cradle by Vonnegut. I think he was a literary genius; his books were incredibly relatable and human, despite the frequent science-fiction themes. If you haven&#039;t read Cat&#039;s Cradle, go pick it up. It&#039;s a very easy read and quite relevant to what we&#039;re doing here in some ways actually.<br /><br />On the non-fiction side, I&#039;d recommend Guns, Germs and Steel. Presents a very interesting take on why people from different parts of the world are different (spoiler alert - it ain&#039;t genetics). I believe Jared Diamond won the Pulitzer Prize for it. Fascinating read.<br /><br />I&#039;m also a sucker for The Princess Bride. The movie is one of my favourites, and the book is even better. <br /><br />

				I&#039;ve just doubled my amazon order thanks to this great thread.(prob at a detriment to SR vendors)<br />&nbsp;here&#039;s my 2 pence worth.<br />&nbsp;The importance of being Earnest- Oscar Wild.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s short but very well written. <br /><br />The social Contract- Jean Jacques Rousseau. His second book Discourse on the origin of inequality was a total pile of shite. If a man posts 1000 ill conceived, moronic comments on threads, but posts 1 of total genius is he still a douche? is his 1 moment of clarity still justified?<br /><br />You don&#039;t have to agree 100% with a book for it to be a must have in your collection. Some of my favorite reads have me screaming at the author. well screaming at my girlfriend about the author. Any thing that is a catalyst for discussion is a good read. Even Mein Kampf has some well articulated, well meaning topics ( untill he goes off on one)

				The Third Policeman - Flann O&#039;Brien<br />V for Vendetta - Alan Moore (and I know the film was listed as part of the DPR bookclub recommended reading and viewing recently, but I love graphic novels and this will always top the list)<br /><br />I think everyone&#039;s faves and recommended reads should change every so often based on what they have just finished and would heartily agree with lilacstar - I read The Hunger Games trilogy and was very impressed. Fiction for teenagers? Revolution for teenagers and everyone who&#039;s sick of wanting... <br /><br />But I digress, the top 2 will always have a room reserved in my mind, even if I&#039;m hooked up to some fucking life support apparatus and am breathing, eating, drinking and pissing thru tubes

Haha a whole series about the coolest drug ever..melange! I totally want some.. <br /><br />Haha add to that The Electric Kool-aid Acid Test by Tom Wolfe.. Fucking excellent Gonzo style nonfiction book following Ken Kesey and his Band of Merry Pranksters.. It details the Pranksters journey in the bus Further to visit the east coast Leary psychonauts as well as Kesey&#039;s acid test during which the embryonic Grateful Dead honed their psychedelic jamming skills..<br /><br />Must read for everyone who is interested in acid or other psychedelics.

				A few of my favorites have already been mentioned, so without repeating any I would definitely have to add The Giver by Lois Lowry and A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L&#039;Engle.&nbsp; Both are easy reads, but incredible books.
