				I have no idea on the status of legality but its a great book (collection of books-errr...whatever) but i think it should be posted everywhere for all to see and then we&#039;ll see how many police and govt personnel try messing with rights of the people.

				Why does it matter? The Anarchist Cookbook is garbage. I&#039;m pretty sure everybody who owns a copy will agree for the most part. I got mine via clearnet in USA. I don&#039;t mean to be a downer, I&#039;m just saying it seems to have a reputation it doesn&#039;t deserve.

				You want your kids to blow their fingers off? To the best of my understanding, the anarchist cookbook is more like the accidentally blow yourself up cookbook.

				Thanks for your replies. A friend wanted me to email them a copy and I just wasnt sure.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=168754.msg1203723#msg1203723">Quote from: happyhippy on June 05, 2013, 08:27 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bearing in mind the issues we have re: Local born terrorists , I think that illegal or not distributing this would bring you to the attention of local LE .<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This was my biggest concern, in light of recent events. I shall err on the side of caution and print it out and give it to them in person I think. <br /><br />
