				I think you&#039;ve explained it quite beautifully there GSE. +1 to you<br /><br />In a utopic world that&#039;s what sex would be about. Loving someone so much that you&#039;d want to be one with someone. A child is a byproduct of that love (as with most everything in life which has a byproduct). Unfortunately, in todays world a lot of people see it as a mere urge that just needs to be fulfilled

				We learn to have sex through the same process as we come to learn anything -curiosity. We are like inductive scientists when we are young, experiencing things for the first time and discerning the wrong (harm, pain and danger) with the good through experimentation (masturbation and eventually sex, but then again even sex for the first time isn&#039;t perfect so we keep trying).<br /><br />I do not believe that love is a necessary condition of sex. In fact naturally the caveman relationship was not monogamous. Communities shared in the act of mating, like a giant orgy. Tribes were smaller then and people shared everything including sex partners. <br /><br />Today, it has been ingrained in us that it is immoral to have multiple sex partners. I think this is for our protection from spreading sexually transmitted diseases. <br /><br />So to answer the original OP&#039;s question, what is sex? A physicalist or neuroscientist might say that it is rooted in a chemical reaction in the brain which drives our impulses, and that attraction is something physical. Romantics might think sex is related to Cupid love. Biologists might say that it is an action for the purpose of pro-creating. Philosophically though, I think sex is what makes us human and we resort to our animinalistic tendencies with complete disregard for the rational, it&#039;s an embracing of total ecstasy that you share with your partner, usually (but not necessarily) bringing you to a higher realm in the relationship.<br /><br />I think I&#039;m going to have some right now :)

				We have two minds, if you are willing to entertain my thoughts for a moment.<br /><br />We have two minds. One is the echo that results from our brain&#039;s billion+ network of neurons. This mind-brain is what delivers us from primitive society (tribes and gangs, like herds and packs). From the collective human mind-brain, there is ancient history, modern technology, economics, theoretical mathematics. The self exists because of the mind, and as a result, survival is as complex as our imagination.<br /><br />The second mind is our reflex-mind. It is governed by our physical body and narco-mind: Sex and drugs. It does not always equate to these to things, but they do a great job of summing up our motivations. Sex, whether it is flirting, touching, or fantasy, is its own drug, generates intense rewards for procreation. (Ironically, Nature&#039;s proclivity for survival is as insistent as its desire for xenocide.) In the body and brain wonderful neurotransmitters exist--to the best of our knowledge--for the sole purpose of reproduction: reward centers for procreation. The reflex-mind is simple and its purpose has nothing and everything do with modern civilization. The orgasm is prolific in nature, affecting nearly every living creature on Earth, and it exists independently of human civilization. Contrarily, the human orgasm is as much apart of modern civilization as it is independent of human existence; sex compels us to succeed, subvert, obstruct, and fail, while religious and moral authorities work tirelessly to find new ways to abhor and subjugate sex in their own quest for power. <br /><br />Narcotics both augment and substitute sexual activities. Viagra and MDMA are examples of augmentation. Heroin is probably the best example for substitution. These are components of our relfex-mind. The physical body is a temple, according to Christian texts--and every other religion, in many respects. Thus, from our physical body comes all our knowledge and experience. It is our anchor to the sea floor which is reality. The wind and rain is the tempest that comprises the meta-brain--the mind. <br /><br />In other words, our mind is bifurcated between the non-physical mental world (dependent) and the physical world (independent). From this bifurcation comes another separation: mind-brain, an entity that is potentially logical and pragmatic, and the reflex-brain, an entity that is impulsive. In my own mind, I have put this in very simple terms: mind and cock. I imagine a brain, spinal cord, and genitals--nothing else. That is what we are. Programmed instincts, passed on through genetics, along with some experiences and knowledge, but ultimately we are bound to our reproduction organs. That is what sex is. Anything else is a creation of our mind-brain, which can never be completely independent of the cock.

Please allow me to elaborate.<br /><br />Benefit Nature v. Benefit Humans.<br /><br />I find this distinction philosophically dangerous. Nature must better be defined in order to separate any human perspective. Unfortunately, humans belong to a subset of nature, so anything that benefits humans, by default, benefits nature. How does one define nature? The known universe is perhaps the easiest analogue of nature. More specifically, we could define nature as all living things--not necessarily limited to DNA/RNA-based organisms, but perhaps a broader scope to include any sentient being as well, such as A.I. However, with refinement of the definition of nature, our definition of nature hinders our ability to resolve any benefits to nature.<br /><br />If nature is the Universe, then it is impossible to accurately describe benefits to a system we do not comprehend. If nature is life, then the difficulties have not been lessened; some organisms survive at the cost of entire species, sometimes ecosystems. This is a very, very complicated argument....

				im sure someone has already said it, but in its most logical form, sex is simply the continuation of the species. i imagine that evolution has caused us to crave sex like we do, because it keeps the human race alive. if we didnt get pleasure out of sex, we would obviously do it way less =D<br /><br />i do remember reading somewhere that dolphins and humans are the only animals that have sex for pleasure.... weird huh?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />

I thought of this purpose before creating this thread and thus wanted to know what is SEX. <br /><br />So, the nature keeps the species alive (continuation of species) through creating its own archetype (SEX) and evolution takes over to create varieties for survival of the species. <br /><br />Since all this tied to one thing that is called the &quot;LIFE&quot;. SEX creates life to keep the &quot;LIFE&quot; alive!!! It&#039;s a self-replicating mechanism. Now as we know that &quot;LIFE&quot; is a self-sustainable process that it is an interaction of energy and matter to produce certain responses; the primary responses being search for food and procreate when the time is ripe. So, at an empirical level we can say that NO SEX means NO LIFE!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This would be the psycho-evolutionary explanation of sex. I think you do not think that by accepting this you deny any of the other theories mentioned here, so it&#039;s not much of a concluding idea. There are numerous ways to explain why we have sex and therefore it&#039;s not a mono-purposeful phenomena.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But I guess, the next big question would be why LIFE and SEX needed at the first place?

				One day I saw conception as a very short summary of the development of humans from its very basic form or organism. Take a look at the spermatozoon, it has tail and pretty much seems like a aquatic organism out in the sea. <br /><br />Other more geek way to see it is that you are uploading your precious data into a new and fresh hardware.

				hahaha what a thread. <br /><br />I think Im too tired to even think about this subject, what a mindfuck.<br /><br />Its (evolutionary) programmed into us to be dumb about sex. Not thinking about what it&nbsp; really is makes reproduction more efficient.<br /><br />of course.. we are all malfunctioning machines here.&nbsp; thats why these subjects can come up. <br />Our brains&nbsp; are chemically different than the uninfluenced human brain. so we can think outside the circle.<br />fuckin weird. <br />someone in my close social circle is pregnant. And she acts like its a fuckin miracle that never happens... I was like: well.. you got fucked. This is what happens when you get fucked. <br />and she looks at me like Im revealing the secret of life.
