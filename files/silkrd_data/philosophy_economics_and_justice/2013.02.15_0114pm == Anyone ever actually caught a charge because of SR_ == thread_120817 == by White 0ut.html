				I am just curious. I have heard of the man in Australia a long time ago and not much more. I don&#039;t like to do a lot of research on it because it makes me paranoid as a mf. So I ask you these questions community.<br />BTW I am referring to USA laws but other countries can chime in!!<br /><br />Has anyone on these actual forums ever caught a charge?<br /><br />What would the name of the charges and maximum charges be for the average personal buyer? I know this depends on country or drugs.<br /><br />How would they go about this process?<br /><br />Obviously with evidence from a poor stealth shipper, then warrant, then jail, but then what happens?<br /><br />I would think you would get into more trouble if you were importing from another country rather than domestic.<br /><br />If no one here has ever been charged then obviously the people that already have been are either in for life or stopped SR&#039;ing completely...<br />Thoughts?<br /><br />Also this isn&#039;t meant to instill fear but rather educate....<br />

				Lol thanks SS lot&#039;s of good info! What I meant by shipping to another address was,<br />&nbsp;I have a friend hrs away, really we are not even in contact that much....<br />I ship to his girls place, when she receives it he then goes and transfers it to his place or a random location, he then pays me more than what I paid for it lol. I win either way, however he does save me personal amounts (I only order what I like). I meet up with him in a discreet place every several weeks or so (other than this I am not in contact), we exchange money/product like a normal deal we would always have aside from SR. The package goes through not only 1 but 2 different places &amp; a 2 week period of sitting before I ever even see it or anything that was in it. I really am not related in any way but I am paying for and shipping it.<br /><br />Basically what I am asking is can I be incarcerated for buying and shipping them over tor, sr, pgp encrypted, BTC anonymized..... While not ACTUALLY receiving any of the product. How do my odds look in your opinion SS, you assuming Im of decent mind of course! Like DPR said anyone can ship you drugs... Which will be my vendor, I am ony paying for it basically. So what I am getting at is without actual drug evidence could I get in trouble for simply using SR, But really not physically using it...<br />Hope this made sense!<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />All of my Q&#039;s are answered for now and asked. I hope this doesn&#039;t sound like a paranoid/situationspecific/useless thread, but more of a educational thread between a n00b and a vet

				Ahh, now I see what you&#039;re really asking :)<br /><br />Yeah, there&#039;s still risk: if you&#039;re ordering large enough amounts, they may actually deliberately let it go through and just keep the recipient under surveillance for awhile.&nbsp; Then he meets with you, some guy a couple hours away that he only talks to on occasion.&nbsp; Looks kind of suspicious.<br /><br />But if they don&#039;t actually do that, then yeah, there&#039;s no chance at all you&#039;ll ever get caught.&nbsp; Unless you screw up and get caught in possession of something, or he&#039;s under surveillance for some other reason (it&#039;s my assumption that every street level dealer gets found eventually -- I&#039;ve certainly never known any that didn&#039;t eventually, anyway).

				There are always going to be some risks, but as long as you are not an idiot, the odds of getting caught and convicted are astronomical.

				White Out, based on your situation, not only are you unlikely to get pinched on domestic orders from well reputed sellers, but that fact you are a few degrees of separation from the receipient makes it even less likely you will ever end up with a conviction from your activities on SR.&nbsp; To clarify one thing, there is indeed no parole on a federal charge, but if you manage to not get infractions while doing your years in federal prison you will do 85% of your sentence with time off for good behavior.&nbsp; With that being said, you will not get a federal trial over user amounts of drugs, most likely.&nbsp; Unless there is a reason the govt might hate you other than your drug purchase such as your politics etc.&nbsp; Main point is based on what you have said, I would say you have one of the lowest chances of ending up doing a bid out of all the buyers on SR.&nbsp; If worse comes to worse, don&#039;t spread your misfortune.&nbsp; Remember the below words, from a wise group known as Geto Boys.<br /><br />We don&#039;t talk to police, we don&#039;t make a peace bond <br />We don&#039;t trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns<br />We rely on the streets, we do battle in the hood <br />I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

				Not to be a jerk but if your friend knows who you are then of course you will get busted if he ever gets pinched. Most folks who get caught with drugs are more than happy to sing to the cops about who they got the drugs from since the cops are telling them that they can either sleep with their girl that night or get ass raped by a homicidal cannibal in a prison cell if they don&#039;t.<br /><br />While it all sounds good the way you have it set up in theory, you have actually increased the likelihood of getting busted by adding AT LEAST two more people into the equation, who knows how many people they have told?<br /><br />Lets face it, the only safe way to get drugs in this country is from a doctor. If you order off the road or by on the street, there are always going to be ways to get you if they want you. Your current method puts you in line for tax evasion, drug distribution, possession, etc. If you just order personal use amounts all you get is possession if they happen to even care about the small amount you get from time to time. <br /><br />Not trying to be preachy, it&#039;s just all about reducing the variables. The fewer people involved in anything illegal the safer it is.

Also what can be reccomended for completely wiping my system of all tor related things, sr notepad txt, saved digital downloads from SR? I plan on transferring all these to the new encrypted HD. Also I will be wiping all of those from 2 seperate windows computers so just let me know what you think on that end. I want NO trace of anything left that wasn&#039;t there before really.<br /><br />DS- Nah man your not being preachy at all. I made this thread for info man, your offering it up on a gold platter! Like others have in here (SS)... &amp; Yes I do realize the likelihood of him snitching on me if the shit hits the fan.... This is a risk when dealing with any source other than SR of course for buying &amp; selling. There is always the chance someone will flip. However, the good thing about SR is that if I don&#039;t like how things are going with this guy for some reason, I can just start shipping to my crib (Home Residence/ Business that receives packages daily) but Ill cross that road when I get there. For the time being I am steadily getting buys under my belt, securing my HD and encrypting everything, until I am 100% experienced with SR and know the ropes like a vet (won&#039;t be till a while from now) all without really any risk besides one snitching on me basically. &amp; I know EVERYONE sings like a bird when it&#039;s their ass on the line but this is also the same guy that has brought me lbs from 3 hrs away on front alone.... Those days have been long ago however... <br />Thanks all.<br />

				Has anyone caught a charge ordering on sr?&nbsp; The only one I heard of was that australian dude.&nbsp; From what I heard he wasn&#039;t careful hardly at all.&nbsp; I&#039;d say with proper stealth, and being aware of whats going on around you, that you could have an undetectable way of doing things.

				Sounds like you&#039;re good to go and people already pointed out the important parts. Such as..<br /><br />Keep all your SR related data on an encrypted hard drive. Stay away from windows if possible.<br /><br />Keep an eye on your contact and establish a pattern for each transaction. Your contact is the <br />only real way you could get into trouble for instance if they were already being watched or <br />were popped and they flipped on you. <br /><br />The cops are there to scare people, watch First 48 and you&#039;ll see all the high 5&#039;s going around <br />after they get someone to tell on themselves... its really sick because these guys probably didn&#039;t <br />have the proof they needed and this is how people plead guilty to shit they didnt commit...<br />It makes me think of sales guys going in for the kill and bragging about their conquest after they<br />get them to sign something that&#039;s NOT in their favor.. same concept.<br /><br />

				I am not sure of actually being busted. But some older teens around my way were using SR extensively for months on end before deciding to order a LB of bud..Soon after they reported to often being followed by the law but I am unsure if this is due to SR or their daily dealings..They often bragged about SR as their source, sold a lot to almost anyone, and most likely didn&#039;t PGP encrypt.
