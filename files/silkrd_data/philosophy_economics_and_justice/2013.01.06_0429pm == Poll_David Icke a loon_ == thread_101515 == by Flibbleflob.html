				I really enjoy reading his books/ listing to him and i&#039;ve found out a lot though reading his books but I don&#039;t trust him 100% but who am I to say what the truth is or what&#039;s real. :)

				Whilst I do agree with some of David Icke&#039;s observations, you do have to bear in mind that he is quite delusional.<br /><br />About 20 years ago he was claiming to be the Son of God, this all came out in his famous interview with Terry Wogan in the early 1990s<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwMNINWcy-A

				I don&#039;t hang on his every word but there are many things he has predicted and come true eg 9/11, recession etc. He is bang on with certain things eg controlling elite, the banking system, the impending police state etc. Then there&#039;s the not so easy to grasp subjects he brings up like the holographic reality, reptilians and the whole saturn/moon thing. I do find his talks very interesting and i am open to these things but i&#039;m not too sure what to make of it just yet.

				When listening to David Icke speak..&nbsp; One must use critical thinking.<br /><br /><br />From what I have heard him go on about, he is definitely right about alot of things..&nbsp; But some other things he says makes him look like a fool.<br /><br /><br />I was the person that voted &quot;He is doing it for the money&quot;...&nbsp; He is running a business.&nbsp; Plain and simple.

He genuinely believes at least some of what he says, and makes a decent living just by spreading those ideas. The theosophic principles at the base of his works do make sense, but neither Icke nor anyone else knows the &quot;ultimate truth&quot;. Messing with chemicals in your brain can make it feel like you know everything, but it just doesn&#039;t translate down to reality. Perhaps we&#039;re all destined to rejoin the universe when we die, but right now we all have our individual desires, thoughts, relationships, and personalities for a reason. It&#039;s called the meaning of life.<br /><br />As for the conspiracy stuff, at least the reptoid believers have the foresight to give the oft-mentioned &quot;they&quot; otherworldly powers and intelligence. No humans would be able to cooperate at the level necessary to control the entire population, especially for this long and without a single breach of security. Sure, the global elite have power, but they&#039;re all too busy competing with each and figuring out what people want and how to sell it to them. Federal agents would rather get wasted and brag about their jobs to women than follow around some boring conspiracy freak. The vast majority are ordinary people that do as little work as they can, especially after they&#039;ve been there a while. If you&#039;re not doing anything illegal, they probably don&#039;t even know you exist. Anyone who thinks LE or legislators/politicians are genius supermen who control everything obviously doesn&#039;t known any.
