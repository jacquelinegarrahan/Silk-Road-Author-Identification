				I think I should preface this by saying I am in no way attempting to do this, I&#039;m just generally curious...<br /><br />Obviously, for street drugs like coke, weed, LSD, etc., that&#039;s not the case, but for things like prescription meds and RC&#039;s, are Indian and Chinese suppliers the main source for drugs on here (and on the black market as a whole)? For example, do you think the 3+ American vendors selling Alprazolam powder are getting it from somewhere like India or do they all somehow have domestic sources (which I would assume is much more strictly regulated)? <br />

				Probably doctors (they ain&#039;t making as much money anymore, either, at least not the ones I know), or I am guessing (from experience) bikers breaking into pharmacies &amp; ripping off the supplies. This was the case years ago - I worked next door to a pharmacy that was getting busted into almost weekly (I had also bought stuff from those same bikers). But that was many years ago, before burglar alarms &amp; cameras were so prevalent. idk about RC&#039;s, maybe some good garage chemists?

				Lots of places do RC synthesis but almost all of them get their precursor chemicals from China, with India a distant second. China also does a huge amount of bulk research chemical synthesis. A lot of Benzos and Ketamine come from India, and India has been the number one supplier of bulk ketamine for ages although China has started to do clandestine ketamine synthesis more recently. Pharmacy robberies account for a small percentage of pills on the market I imagine, a lot of them are high quality counterfeits pressed with bulk powder clandestinely synthesized in India usually, and a lot of them are from pill mill operations where doctors write scripts to accomplices (Florida is a hot spot for this). You would be surprised how many pills on the illicit market were pressed in some garage by some dude with bulk powder connects.
