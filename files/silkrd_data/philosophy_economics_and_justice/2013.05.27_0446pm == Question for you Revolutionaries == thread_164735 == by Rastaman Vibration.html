				I have a question for you wise sages:<br /><br />When I introduce friends to Tor, and eventually to SR, is it a good or bad idea to let my friends IRL know my SR Forum username? Not my SR username, just the forum&nbsp; name. I haven&#039;t told said friends that I actually make purchases.&nbsp; I also encourage them to find out more and recommend the wealth of information available on these forms. So should we know each other&#039;s forum names?<br /><br />My gut tells me that its a good idea to have people who are already your trusted friends IRL be connected to you in the virtual shadow world. Maybe if something goes wrong with you, they will know about it and can notify the community in case you can&#039;t.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know, its just a gut felling. Plus I&#039;m kinda high :P<br /><br />What are your thoughts? Security risk or important communication tool?<br /><br />Peace

				That&#039;s a tough one.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure many forum members agonize over introducing people to this forum and the SR site.&nbsp; I would say go with your gut but also use your head.&nbsp; If you decide to share that kind of info with friends make sure they are &quot;truly&quot; friends who you can trust with your life.&nbsp; I have lost a couple friends because of this site.&nbsp; They really were not real friends so I regret nothing.&nbsp; I never told them my personal info so I was saved in that respect.&nbsp; Just be careful that you don&#039;t give these friends of yours anything they can bury you with.

				People that use SR can have real friends?! When did this happen, why didnt you tell me sooner?!<br /><br />I vote for security risk, knowing your forum name/user name seems unimportant if you have other methods of communication that don&#039;t put your secret identity at risk.

				I like to compartmentalise my stuff. In&nbsp; some jurisdictions being on SR or its forums is enough &quot;intent&quot; to be locked up. Keep everything on a need to know basis and they will have less to tell (especially if under duress)

				I have a couple of trusted friends who I would consider introducing in the future once I&#039;ve got my head around the place and tested the water a bit. I don&#039;t see the need to tell them my forum name, but then I&#039;m not planning on becoming a vendor or anything, so if anything did ever happen the community wouldn&#039;t need to know as they wouldn&#039;t notice I was gone - I plan to be as invisible as possible!

				im very very very leary to give my sr details to anyone. one friend of mine hinted at it and i just shrugged it off. the less they know the better. <br />maybe if ansr forums alias is made that doesnt match up to your SR market alias maybe thats possible. just becareful about keeping them seperate :D

				I say if you think they&#039;re smart enough to not get caught, even though it&#039;s unlikely, then let them know. <br /><br />I&#039;d just make sure they don&#039;t post or say anything on clearnet regarding any of their usernames.<br />

				honestly i do not think it is a big deal to tell your friends if you only use SR for small personal amounts of drugs once in a while. It depends what kind of crowd you hang out with though, if a lot of your friends get in trouble with the law often for drug related charges, then there is a bigger chance they&#039;ll sell you out for a lighter sentence.<br /><br />But if you regularly receive large shipments, it is stupid to tell anyone IRL about any association w/ the SR - forums or the actual market.

Obviously it&#039;s your choice to tell people, it&#039;s your life and thus your prerogative but that being the case if it goes wrong it&#039;s on you to either accept the consequences or get yourself out of the shit by getting rid of whoever you tell. It&#039;s that simple.

				It&#039;s safer, imho, not to tell anyone at all.<br />If you tell someone, perhaps they will be judgmental.<br />Perhaps if the friendship turns sour, <br />they&#039;ll decide it&#039;s okay for them to tell everybody.<br />If you tell no one, these things can&#039;t happen.<br />
