				The LSD experience shows us once and for all that the mind contains higher powers than we ever dreamed of; that these powers can be scientifically catalogued and inventoried; and they can be released on a wider scale. The LSD revelation is that Consciousness is eternal; that it is one with the divine Cosmos; and that the purpose of life is the joyful discovery of our cosmic and divine nature. This is also the central truth common to all religions.<br /><br />What we should be aiming for is a gradual osmosis of the LSD revelation,&nbsp; particularly among the scientific community. If we can get scientists on our side, if we can map and inventory the higher powers of the mind using the accepted tools of scientific truth, without alarming the philistines and the narrow-minded with extraordinary claims, then we might have a chance to change the world...<br /><br />And the way to accomplish this is to recruit as many philosophers, physicists, chemists, biologists, psychologists, anthropologists, etc., to the psychedelic point of view as humanly possible. And then &quot;turn on&quot; the Best and Brightest to the LSD perspective, under the guise of scientific research...<br /><br />For as Aldous Huxley put it:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;The man who comes back through the Door in the Wall will never be quite the same as the man who went out.... He will be wiser but less cocksure, happier but less self-satisfied, humbler in acknowledging his&nbsp; ignorance...&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />He will also be open to a spiritual vision of reality.<br /><br />The Elite always sets the tone of society. If we can turn on the elite, we can transform society for the better.

				There is no question that they can change the world, the problem is getting mainstream society to believe it. With the current attitude the majority have on drugs, LSD is no different than cocaine or heroin. The idea that a recreational drug can actually be used for self improvement sounds ridiculous to the average person. Anyone who says otherwise is dismissed as &quot;rationalizing their drug use&quot;. It&#039;s really horribly frustrating.

				I don&#039;t agree exactly with OP but I believe they psychedelics could change the world. However, I don&#039;t believe they will because people are too ignorant and/or brainwashed.

His rather reckless, and one might even say democratic, stance toward the use of psychedelics only resulted in the prohibition of these substances.

				I think it is too powerful for governments to want to control or even legalize. The idea of a substance changing future generations scares the Elite, so they laugh off the spiritual and lifechanging effects just like other substances. Can psychedelics change the world? Absolutely. Will they change the world? People yes, world no; because there will always be those in control fear this radical change and have the media to back their fear of change. <br /><br />Psychedelics are powerful, powerful substances that draw most users to the same focal perspectives. I can only begin to imagine a world where the goals of living were the understanding and knowledge of reality.

I take 250ug minimum, unless it&#039;s just a low dose for purposes other than tripping, such as improving focus during an artistic project of any sorts. If it&#039;s a very public trip I go lower, but never below 200 or 250ug. With psychedelics I only regret taking too little, never too much.

				They already changed the world massively if one tends to go with Terence McKenna and his worth reading &#039;Food of the Gods&#039; ... one idea is that the consumption of psilocybine mushrooms evoked an important alteration of the consciousness which made apes to men to put it simply.<br />That Leary and his doing changed the world too is not a question ...<br /><br />... the question is: what changes are awaiting us to fulfill them and what will it need this time (which substance e.g.) if it needs anything at all but the human mind \o/

Because of this I believe you are reduced to a single perspective: yours. This was helpful to us in the wild when survival was in actually in play and we essentially had no morality. Now that we have evolved past the &quot;it&#039;s me or you&quot; attitude, I feel that we need to enhance our moral values by understanding the perceptions and perspectives of our brethren, i.e. reducing the ego a bit. Also, the reduction of the ego can be done to the point of &quot;ego death&quot; without psychedelics -- ego death is the life goal of a Buddhist monk. Meditation could be seen as &quot;sober tripping.&quot; In my opinion, the ego is a primal, animalistic part of us that reduces our potential to work together and progress -- it is an abyss of greed and desire, the root of over-consumption and self-entitlement. <br /><br />That said, it is an absolutely necessary piece of us that holds our identity together. It should exist, it should just never control you. If you can conquer your ego, you have the ultimate willpower.

Just overwhelming horror and paranoia in general. Also getting certain thoughts stuck in my head that would take on a life of its own. Can&#039;t remember precisely what they were anymore, just remember getting stuck in these fucked up thought loops that weren&#039;t in the slightest bit comforting at all. It wasn&#039;t quite &quot;I am an orange&quot; then thinking and believing I was, but something pretty similar and pretty disconcerting. Like thinking really neurotic and grotesque thoughts of what &quot;I&quot; was and was capable of which I don&#039;t believe at all were healthy or desirable things to think about or obsess upon.<br /><br />Prior to that I had some very beautiful and mind blowing experiences. Like auditory hallucinations where I heard the most gorgeous music that if I had just the tenacity to record would be a symphony. But for me it just wasn&#039;t worth the risk anymore of going to that negative place that was just too horrific for words to really do it any justice. Actually a lot of people that I&#039;ve spoken to that no longer touch psychedelics after having a bad trip or trips seem to be of this same reasoning even if the nature of their bad trips were entirely different.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				i definitely see where you are coming from man.<br />maynard from tool says that you should &quot;get the message, and hang up the phone&quot;<br /><br />basically learn something from psychedelics then leave them alone. and lsd has always been a tricky substance in my opinion. tim leary was a good example of that (even though he took too much)<br /><br />either way the ego is a little bit important. it helps communication go smoothly, even though it stops a lot of thoughts from being said, which is why i dont like the ego.<br /><br />the ego is the source of separation between men in a way haha.<br /><br />without it all-together, the world would be a&nbsp; better place. <br /><br />we would work together as one organism.&nbsp; ::)

				Regarding the question if psychedelics can change the world I might have to say that psychedelics changed my life and if something can change my life it can change the lifes of others too and further if something can change a small part it can change the whole thing as well. So from my point of view the answer is yes!<br /><br />Psychedelics not only can change the world they do already change the world, since they are used by mankind. Maybe the use of psychedelics can be seen as something that distinguished man from animal...

It&#039;s the kids that became so warped from the acid they took that came to believe he was Christ incarnate that committed the murders on his command. If you watch the documentary Helter Skelter you can see firsthand how deluded they became as some of them speak of watching Charlie firsthand perform miracles and magic before their very eyes. <br /><br />And these weren&#039;t the kind of kids who came from broken homes all &quot;torn up inside&quot; as you might expect. These were kids from decent middle to upper class homes and good families who had All-American happy upbringings. They just happened to meet the wrong guy during the sixties amidst the counterculture movement when the widely practiced &#039;in&#039; thing of the youth of that era was to seek spirituality through psychedelic experimentation.<br /><br />

				Unfortunately, several paradoxes come to mind with the noble intentions of the OP.<br /><br />As a race, we have a poor track record when it comes to organized &quot;spiritual&quot; movements.<br /><br />The 1% essentially rise to the top pretty quickly and use it as a powerbase to start turf wars with the other movements.<br /><br />Virtually all mainstream religions have followed this trajectory, irrespective of how pure and conscientious their founders&#039; principles.<br /><br />So to sum up, if psychedelics ever achieved mainstream acceptance, most likely it would be the TV evangelists selling them at a vast mark up, with DVD&#039;s full of rants, to watch while you tripped {shudder}. <br /><br />At the same time, I think it&#039;s deeply irresponsible that proper research is not being carried out into the use of psychedelics for e.g. PTSD in veterans. Anecdotal evidence suggests this could be a profoundly effective avenue of treatment, but big pharma don&#039;t want to know (no patent for LSD!)<br /><br />I also think that, somehow, psychedelics can give the layman a chance to understand the world in quantum terms. Matter as waves, uncertainty, and synchronicity all seem to be perceptible in certain altered states. I don&#039;t know enough about this myself, but I&#039;d be curious to see what an expert made of that aspect of the experience.<br /><br />Personally, I feel the outlook is pretty grim. The energy which powered mass consciousness in the 60&#039;s is being shrink-wrapped, corporatized and anaesthetized in one big virtual shopping mall. Opportunities for collective organisation are few, and increasingly subject to &quot;anti-terror&quot; legislation, using the enhanced surveillance techniques now available.<br /><br />On the other hand, I suppose they didn&#039;t have SR back then either&nbsp; ;)

				I think it&#039;s a question of balance.<br /><br />Any insight you get on LSD or any other psychedelic drug is only one piece of the puzzle. You can&#039;t suggest you&#039;ve solved the whole puzzle by merely taking the drug. It&#039;s ridiculous.<br /><br />Psychedelics may well contribute to changing the world for better but in this case, they will be only one of the countless factors.

				I would be inclined to think that the powers that be are fully aware of the psychological effects of LSD on individuals and the community as a whole. The gov. has spent millions of dollars on psychic soldiers and the LSD phenomenon. Here is where progress is halted; if our society was to integrate the uses of mind expansive drugs we would all be creatures of conscious. All the frivolous power hungry actions of the worlds&#039; governments would be plain to see, and there would no longer be nations of complacent consumers. No more worker bees to chop the wood and carry the water. They need an upper echelon to control the masses whom are largely happy with their hum drum lives. I can&#039;t stress how frequently i feel that I&#039;m adrift in a sea of talking apes. Why would any government want a nation of intellectuals? If people realized that their individual life stretched beyond death, then the purpose of human life itself shifts from the mundane day to day to the score of eons.&nbsp; To start planning for the next 1,000 years of our life instead of the next 50 is a huge transition. Why would those in charge want to relinquish unlimited power of decision making and unlimited monetary control?<br /><br />LSD and other tools to open the doors of perception are extremely taboo at this current stage in human existence. During the 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s the scientific community was in a flurry about the LSD phenomenon and the resulting effects on the human mind. They were calling it a wonder-drug, and the future of human evolution. Nowadays, if you tell people the future of our society is a mind altering substance they immediately discount the possibility. Why? Because we have been bred as a society to point the finger at those who choose to alter their consciousness. The zeitgeist of the Americans is possibly the most influenced by the anti-drug mind-state. All that being said, the value of Silk Road is that people are bucking against the current taboos and taking their rights into their own hands. The people know whats right and wrong apart from what a massive government tells them. I believe it is the human right, no the human responsibility to alter consciousness and experiment with what could be! I say dream on. Make reality as you see fit.

Easily. Ignorance. Americans are indoctrinated from a young age to believe America is the best country, the most socially advanced country, and the most freeeeee country. Of course this opinion is formed without ever traveling to a foreign country or actually doing any research to back such claims. Also it&#039;s my opinion that people would rather stick to the socially accepted beliefs rather than become aware of some truths that can be uncomfortable. I honestly wish i could trust in the government we give unquestionable power and authority to, but the reality is they are supposed to have that power with the purpose of protecting us and our lands, also they are expected to make the hard calls that most people lack the fortitude to. This power and trust we give them to make these decisions is instead used to financially infiltrate less developed countries, perpetually incarcerate its own citizens, and further the industrial complexes of our military. The sad truth of it is that our educational system does not educate us and by in large people are drinking the cool aid. OH no the government wouldnt do this, certainly wouldnt do that.... The government wouldn&#039;t import Heroin from the golden triangle using military crafts and circulate it for massive profits then arrest the ethnic pushers for it.... There are dozens of examples where big government is caught red handed doing ridiculously heinous acts but the news never reports on it... If it wasnt for the internet information highway alot of the shifty dealings of the gov would be swept under the rug and never brought to light. Keep blowing the whistles. Keep thinking for yourselves dont regurgitate the pleasantries of your family friends and neighbors. Revolution is coming slowly but surely. If this is a physical revolution or a revolution of the peoples&#039; minds it is on the horizons. We deserve the freedoms we blindly holler to the rest of the world about.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				No, they can change a individuals life who chooses he is ready for whatever experience he wants to go through. Psychedelics are too strong to be exposed to a mass audience and there a awful lot of people I know who would not enjoy the effects. I&#039;m sure many other people also have a friend who has had a bad trip and never quite returned to normality, one of my best friends has been suffering from post traumatic stress and depression for two years following a bad trip he had in my presence. Seeing that happen made me realize that psychedelics are truly something to respect otherwise you may end up paying a hefty price, this view hasn&#039;t put me off psychedelics at all although I have only taken acid once since and felt quite uneasy, but i&#039;m perfectly happy on 2cb and have recently tried DMT which was hands down one of the best drug experiences of my life.&nbsp; &nbsp;
