				Looking at the history of Nippon (Japan), I cannot help but wonder how amazing they are. This is not an attempt to glorify any race over another, but instead, to take an example of security through historical social changes that have progressed. This approach demonstrates how overcoming conflict and seeking peace guarantees success most of the time.<br /><br />This thread is dedicated to seeking out knowledge and evidence for developing a methodology of sustainable security. As the world works toward sustainable goals, such as solar, wind, rain, tidal, static electricity (Tesla), we are fast approaching the event in human history in which out intelligence matches our technological race for ever-growing and never ending Perpetual Motion.<br /><br />It was recently stated on the forums that there exists a Perpetual Motion machine. Laws of physics deny any such entity to exist--that is, any single machine that can last forever. Well, after a 10 mile jog, I realized something. The perpetual motion machine does exist, but it does create a great deal of entropy in its wake... such as Superbugs now found in almost every American hospital. Superbugs are an example of a perpetual motion machine.<br /><br />Superbugs demonstrate how biological cycles, through genetic inheritance (DNA), are immortal and everlasting. They will last until something destroys them. There have been extinction events, demonstrated by Earth&#039;s fossil--(and fossil fuel... which we burn instead of investigate.... What did a Saudi prince once say: It is humanity&#039;s most precious resource, and all we do is burn it)--record dating back billions of years, and we have clues that date back millenia--when humanity was a global enterprise: pyramids cropped up ALL OVER EARTH.... probably not alien or UFOs, but human intelligence.<br /><br />The point behind shit like THRIVE, which was aforementioned in the forums, is to inspire the human mind to recognize that the Universe is a perpetual motion machine. The Sun is giving off more energy than 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 humans could use. That&#039;s 10 to the 15th power, or 10**15. As resources grow more abundant, their values do not diminish, but are worth infinitely more when we consider what we can DO with them. The value of gold will not deplete if everyone has a gold bar--it will exponentially increase!!!!<br /><br />Don&#039;t you get it? Bitcoin (BTC) is the most powerful and important resources humanity (Japan) has ever invented. Japan gave us the bitcoin, and the only thing that could ever repay that gift is by moving on from Earth. It is time our species takes a turn for controlling Earth for our benefits, learning how we can exist beyond the Earth, and expanding our intelligence beyond racist wars between Arabs and Jews and Whites and Mexicans and Pollish and German and Japanese and Chinese.... do you see what I&#039;m getting at here?<br /><br />Pirates were the earliest forms of Absolute Democracy. If the leader was not accepted by everyone, then he was re-chosen. Pirates battled the weather and sea, and survived on plundering corrupt institutions--kingdoms and empires. We can continue in this tradition and create our society based on intelligence and equal decision-making power--which can only be achieved by honest men and women--those bound by the laws of nature. In the case of pirates, it was the sea that claimed the lives of cowards and idiots. Let&#039;s keep in that tradition, and look to the sky for the next extinction event--and fucking survive it.<br /><br />Where to begin????<br /><br />Terraforming. If everyone has the education of an engineer--B.S. level, not the BS level that American education is becoming--then it will make futures like that found in the fictional series Firefly (or the movie Serenity) a certainty, instead of just magic and fiction....<br /><br />Japan: Prevent tsunamis from destroying your beautiful empire: build a machine the size of Tokyo to harness the energy of S and P waves from earthquakes, instead of just designing buildings to dampen harmonic frequencies. Build the land to do that also, under the ocean, so that inevitable and certain tectonic shifts do not wreak havoc as the recent tsunami did.... but in parallel with this, build sea walls capable of an unimaginable tragedy--and extinction event--and then you will have an insurance policy on your entire civilization.<br /><br />This is the beginning of a tome of knowledge that is in my head. I want to get out before I commit suicide--because if I don&#039;t tell the world how to save itself, then there is no point in living.

				Billionaires are not stupid people. Engineers are not stupid people. Dedicated and compassionate human beings are not stupid people. Who will survive the next extinction event? Lucky people and smart people. Let&#039;s be lucky and smart.<br /><br />If you want to combat stupidity, then you yourself must commit yourself to an intelligent existence--the pursuit of the human potential.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142835.msg976304#msg976304">Quote from: Maple Serum&nbsp; on April 04, 2013, 06:25 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=142835.msg976197#msg976197">Quote from: surmer on April 04, 2013, 05:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">Superbugs demonstrate how biological cycles, through genetic inheritance (DNA), are immortal and everlasting.

Laws? No, they have be able to read, think, and do for themselves. That is why they are in Congress. They all have law degrees.... I don&#039;t consider them stupid people at all. Now, if you believe you are in a democracy, then perhaps it is stupid people--but we&#039;re not in a democracy. Corporates have the same legal rights to expression as people, but they have the resources of millions of people... and those resources talk louder than any &quot;stupid person&quot; ever could....

				By &quot;stupid people&quot; I was referring to those who just want the government to do everything for them, the presidential candidates that think it is wrong to let a women pregnant through rape get an abortion, the people who think that a semi-automatic rifle is more dangerous than a semi-automatic pistol,&nbsp; the congressmen who try to push through bills to give them more control over the internet, and the people who go along with it because they actually believe those people either have their best interests at heart or who are objective and rational enough to be in charge of a country. <br /><br />Just because someone has a law degree does NOT mean they have degrees is economics, physics, or IT. It does NOT mean they actually understand what some of the stuff they legislate about actually is. It just means they have the power to make laws about it. <br /><br />The corporations having that much power is part of the problem, they can use all those resources to influence politics in their favor with no regard for the country as a whole. <br /><br />A lot of dedicated and compassionate people can be stupid, such as those hardcore Christians that feel bad for you because you are not christian like they are, or Jehovah&#039;s Witnesses that take their religious text as literally as possible and only want to bring you in to the light so they can save you, or the people who think weed is &quot;the devils lettuce&quot; and that &quot;injecting marijuanas can kill you&quot;.<br /><br />Stupid people do exist. Lazy people do exist. Power hungry people exist. Greedy people exist. They outnumber the people who honestly believe in trying to make the world a better place, the engineers and benevolent billionaires and noble prize winners. And they vote. That is the issue with a democracy like the US.

				Thanks for the reply. Sorry to poke and prod, but I just don&#039;t like lazy answers. It&#039;s my way of weeding out the ignorant from the rest... I&#039;m sure you understand the implications of the Gaussian curve... otherwise known as the Bell Curve. It&#039;s a thermodynamic fact about human intelligence, and you&#039;re absolutely right about the law degree.<br /><br />I have worked along side and against many politicians. It is a brutal affair to convince them of anything that doesn&#039;t have to do with $$$$ in their pockets. I have a degree in chemistry. I plan on going to law school, and one day study in Muenchen for international IP Law. Bitcoin is a beautiful subject for just that reason.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks again for the thoughtful response. That&#039;s all I&#039;m looking for in life--to make sure my life is still on track.
