				If you are trying too hard to Meditate it can&#039;t happen.&nbsp; You must let all your thoughts go and if you are thinking about how you wanna see what meditation is like well then you&#039;ll never make any progress.&nbsp; The key is to LET GO.

				the meditation which worked most for me, is one in which i focus on a specific chakra.. it&#039;s all about rhythm of breathe.&nbsp; If no knowledge about chakras, no matter.&nbsp; Just close your eyes and stop movement,&nbsp; imagine your every breathe feeling up a large balloon floating in the sky; imagine upon each exhale -as the balloon looses pressure, it dips a bit, but still remains afloat. <br /><br />as you quite your mind and movement, you&#039;ll feel a very loose sensation; this is the meditative state you want to be in.&nbsp; I have had some powerful session with the help of ketamine and other psychedelics.&nbsp;

So you&#039;re not going anything wrong per say, you could just use some tips to strengthen your practice.<br /><br />First, there&#039;s many different ways to meditate. All involve clearing your mind and focusing solely on your breath, but some get there using different tools. For example, some religious believers will meditate by focusing their mind&#039;s eye on the image of a god or goddess they believe in, others repeat a mantra or series of mantras in their mind, some chant, others focus on shapes or image situations like their thoughts being leaves falling on a big lake that is slowly filling up. In Vipassana meditation, you are essentially asked to sit and focus on being aware of all the sensations in your body by scanning yourself up and down systematically. <br /><br />So you can use whatever method works best for you, try some and more and see what suits you the most. What matters, is that you are focusing on your breath inhale and exhale, and have the dedication to sit through the waywardness of sitting that comes up sometimes. <br /><br />A common misconception is that meditation is about emptying your mind of all thoughts. This is wrong. You don&#039;t want to try and stop thinking, that&#039;s impossible. The goal is to gain control over your mind so that you are aware of your thoughts without engaging in them, simply acknowledging your thoughts passing with no attachment. <br /><br />I wish there were ways to just &quot;make the meditation chemicals release&quot; like you say and suddenly become enlightened. But unfortunately it&#039;s a practice like any other, and a hard one at that, but one that can truly help you as an individual on many levels. <br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, is metta. Metta is loving kindness, or compassion. While you meditate, try gently focusing love towards yourself and then those close to you, and you feel comfortable, you can eventually focus it outwards towards your city, country, etc. This will help create a &quot;field&quot; of metta around you that you might actually be able to feel if you are perceptive enough, and sit in the same spot everytime. Metta also helps fill your body with happy vibes :)<br /><br />Hope this helps!
