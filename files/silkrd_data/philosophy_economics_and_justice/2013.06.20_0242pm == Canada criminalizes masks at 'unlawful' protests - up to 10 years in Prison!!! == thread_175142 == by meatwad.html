				WOW, 10 fucking years in jail just for wearing a mask.&nbsp; Did someone say Draconian?!<br /><br />http://www.theverge.com/2013/6/20/4447544/canada-bill-c-309-concealment-identity-act-criminalizes-masks-at-riots<br /><br />&quot;Canada’s controversial Concealment of Identity Act banning the wearing of masks during riots and &quot;unlawful assemblies&quot; has just gone into law, carrying with it a 10-year maximum sentence, reports CBC News. The private member’s bill was introduced in 2011 by MP Blake Richards in response to the increasing prevalence of vandalism at political protests and sporting events.<br /><br />&quot;What distinguishes an unlawful assembly from a lawful one?&quot;<br /><br />It’s noteworthy that there is already a federal law in Canada that prohibits wearing a disguise &quot;with intent to commit an indictable offence&quot; and carries the same 10-year maximum. The distinction in language is deliberate: Richards has criticized the existing law for its high burden of proof. Now, instead of requiring intent to commit a criminal act in order to charge a protester, he or she only needs to be in attendance at an unlawful assembly. Richards has insisted that the law is necessary for dealing with protesters &quot;pre-emptively,&quot; before a protest escalates. And what distinguishes an unlawful assembly from a lawful one? The CBC points out that it’s &quot;an assembly of three or more persons who, with intent to carry out any common purpose, assemble in such a manner… as to cause persons in the neighbourhood… to fear… that they will disturb the peace tumultuously.&quot;<br /><br />Many, such as Osgoode Hall Law School Professor James Stribopoulos, have pointed to the possible &quot;chilling effects&quot; posed by making it unlawful to disguise one’s identity at a protest, say to prevent against reprisals from your boss or coworkers, or to avoid facial recognition software. The CBC notes that exceptions can be made for &quot;lawful excuses&quot; for face covergings, like religion or medical conditions, but Stribopoulos has countered that most judgments about an excuse’s &quot;lawfulness&quot; will fall to police in the field.&quot;

				This can be construed as communism at its finest. But hey, look at Brazil today and see they&#039;re doing...Canada has been known to shut down transfers for bitcoins through nova scotia bank. maybe they just want to instill fear into ther people so they don&#039;t riot. until the people rise...

				LE are certainly treating the Montreal tuition protests as unlawful. <br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing: LE have proven themselves untrustworthy to the Canadian public. They don&#039;t give a damn about Charter rights. They seed nonviolent protest groups with provocateurs. They film protestors and, before the next protest, pre-emptively arrest ringleaders and other undesirables on bullshit charges. This is all documented fact. <br /><br />If people were free to protest without fear, they wouldn&#039;t need masks.

				I wish i knew more about Canadian law. I am surprised this is news coming from Canada not US, i could see US passing this but didn&#039;t think Canada hated freedom (a.k.a. was as terrified of the people) as much as USA. <br /><br />Lets wait for the loopholes around this law to emerge, FUCK LE, going to find my &#039;guy fawkes&#039; mask right now.

				Yeah this is a real fuckin laugh.&nbsp; :o<br /><br />They forgot to say in the report that the po po is allowed to wear masks and tear off their ID badges. Many who did that during the G20 riots were even promoted for their good service.<br /><br />Carry on. Nothing to see here...

				Protesting is NOT illegal. <br /><br />Wearing a mask during a protest so you can commit physical and environmental damage is. <br /><br />What are the complaints? Anyone protesting and hiding their face does not truly believe in the point of their protest. Why would you hide your face from something you are proud of? <br /><br />This law protects everyone else and makes protests easier to keep lawful(less looting and stupid bullshit)<br /><br />EDIT: I&#039;m saying this law protects Canadians and it&#039;s visitors by stopping thugs from using protests to wreak havoc on peace.

But the police have *proven* that they will abuse their power, film protesters not just to track those who commit crimes, but to punish them for their participation. Until our government demonstrates a respect for civil rights, how can they expect the people to commit to a de-anonymised dialogue?

They dressed in plain clothes and wore masks then busted shit up so their uniformed colleagues could beat the shit out of everyone else. Only reason why they were found out is some union guy called them out. Remember that?<br /><br />Probably not.<br /><br />The point is that the government has given LE rights to abuse the people and the people are left pissing in the wind. LE can wear masks and tear off their name badges. No problems there. But if you wear a mask to a peaceful protest and some unmasked people turn it violent, YOU&#039;RE the one who&#039;s fucked. How does that make any sense???

But it seems to me that either way (masked or unmasked LE), we&#039;re fucked. May as well even the playing field a little.
