				I had a friend get pulled over with weed &amp; some MDMA in his car.<br /><br />His molly was in caps, LE asked him what it was he said it was &quot;bath salts&quot; <br /><br />They didn&#039;t even charge him for 1/4th the shit they could have. They claimed they were going to send the <br />&quot;bath salts&quot; to the lab but considering he got like a paraphernalia ticket and that&#039;s it I have a feeling <br />its going to go into a box or the garbage.<br /><br />IDK, it was under 1g of MDMA so I hope he isn&#039;t fucked <br /><br />He didn&#039;t sign anything, make a statement, or get taken in. Its like they wrote him a parking ticket he didn&#039;t even get a DUI or DWI. He just drove back home seemed strange to me

				That depends on many things.&nbsp; If you&#039;re in the US then it also depends a lot on what state this happened in.&nbsp; If I were your friend I&#039;d definitely not keep anything in my residence though.&nbsp; I&#039;d imagine the clock is ticking until a search occurs.&nbsp; Police do some crazy, non-intuitive shit sometimes.&nbsp; <br />I had a friend caught with 12 pounds of weed.&nbsp; The police let him go and did nothing for about six months.&nbsp; Then searched his residence, found a very small amount and proceeded to charge him with an assortment of things.

				Your friend is facing 20-70 years without parole. Tell him to buy a dildo to practice raping before he goes to prison.<br /><br />Seriously now, why the fuck are you asking a question that has the answer in it?<br /><br />It&#039;s like you go to the shop and ask.<br /><br />How much does the $1 soda cost?

				Just look up the consequences for the charges for your district / state and get rid of all illegal things, car house and person. <br /><br />What was the parking ticket for? I don&#039;t understand how we can answer this with the info provided. Did they take the drugs? <br /><br />20-70 years is unrealistic and almost every single possession charge gets parole -- no every single one. There&#039;s a good chance he&#039;ll serve it out in probation if it&#039;s a first offense, but like I said, there&#039;s not enough info to know.

				You may get lucky and the assholes just stole his drugs. Cops get high too and I have seen it happen that way before. 16 years ago I was busted and not charged for things I had, just the paraphernalia. BUT cleaning house, phone and computer and talking to a lawyer would be a great idea.

				When people get caught with illegal shit and they&#039;re free the same day, it&#039;s more then likely because they&#039;re now working with the police. <br /><br />However, if it&#039;s true what he is saying then he just better hope it never actually gets sent for testing because he&#039;s going to be charged with it.

				I agree with some of the above.&nbsp; If i get pulled over and have 1,&nbsp; one, uno, pills on me,&nbsp; that thing is going to be sloshing in my stomach before the bacon even steps out of his car.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Now, If I had 5, that would be a diff story.

				I think this has been wrapped up.&nbsp; Get a lawyer, clean house.&nbsp; Stop using drugs (if possible...not saying I would but it is a good idea.&nbsp; If you MUST use than do it at a friends house and make sure its personal quantity not bulk...better to drop dirty for smoking a J at a buddies house than have them follow-up at home address and find a sack, even if personal.&nbsp; As the person said above they can come later and still charge him with things even for a 20 sack.&nbsp; I got caught driving smoking and my friend had 1/2 ounce of mediocre bud and I got 6 charges!&nbsp; Of course they dropped all but 2 or so for plea bargain, it is normal for them to add tons of charges that would never stick just to make them get what they want in plea and not lose the charge they want).

				Nuthin&#039; I can add - Clean House, car, Hard drive or computer, and body. As FBI said, it also depends where (a good lawyer at this point is a good idea). If nothing happens in 6-12 months (nothing ANYTHING with the Bullen) , your friend can draw a breath. But be paranoid a while longer.&nbsp; :-\
