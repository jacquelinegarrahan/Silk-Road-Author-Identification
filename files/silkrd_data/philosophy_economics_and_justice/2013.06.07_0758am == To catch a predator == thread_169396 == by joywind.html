				I liked &#039;&#039;To Catch a Predator&#039;&#039; because it was an unintentional indictment of America. Hansen is this normal white Christian guy, and the chomos he&#039;d expose were mostly Jews, immigrant weirdos, wealthy shitlibs, self-styled negro lotharios, and some token typical lumpenproles. In other words, chomo demographics basically look like a DNC convention.

				The majority of people arrested on that show wouldn&#039;t have broken any laws in a huge part of the world. So it does do a good job of casting America as a religious police state, which it is.

				&#039;To Catch a Predator&#039; had entertainment value but it&#039;s easy to play the devil&#039;s advocate on this one. If the honeypot victims were supposedly 8 or 10, for example, you could make a better case for the men being &quot;predators&quot; and they would be actual pedophiles, too. Often the victims were 13-15, which is post pubescent (definitely not pedophilia) and over the age of consent in many civilized countries. There&#039;s a lot of men who are sexually and psychologically within the bounds of normalcy who&#039;d fuck an attractive, very receptive 15 year old. I know because I&#039;ve seen it with my own eyes and the only argument against it being consensual and mutually desired is legalistic (the law says they couldn&#039;t give consent, but they did give consent and would correctly be assessed as looking for a male to fuck within the hour). If it were legal and a good opportunity presented itself, I would have sex with the right 15 year old girl and so would most men who are open to having sex with a female they don&#039;t already know. It&#039;s not what comes to mind when I think of predatory behavior and it&#039;s not sexually deviant.<br /><br />I have rather typical, socially acceptable tastes in the opposite sex and zero attraction to the kiddies. <br /><br />My point is that the show demonized and ruined the lives of men who weren&#039;t fundamentally unlike much of the male audience who shook their heads and smirked at the perverted freaks, who may have been nothing of the kind. I do not doubt that the program attracted dangerous, aggressive rapists, too, but everyone was painted with the same brush. If there&#039;s anyone out there who says he isn&#039;t attracted to anyone underage and wouldn&#039;t under any circumstances consider having such a person as a sexual partner, regardless of legality, he&#039;s a common liar.<br /><br />&#039;To Catch a Predator&#039; was all about pathologizing normal, healthy male sexuality because the state determined that in some instances, it is punishable to act upon it. However, the law cannot make men into perverts. It could theoretically outlaw all sexual activity, but by doing so, it would not be true that everyone is deviant but the celibate. As if they&#039;re not getting punished enough by the authorities, they get exposed on national TV as well. This show is not the sort of thing we should be cheering on. It&#039;s at best misleading and unfair, at worst it is a malicious attack on men in general. The media has a strange fascination with portraying male sexuality as threatening and warning everyone that it can explode into violence if men are not watched over carefully. Content with this underlying theme is a negative influence that erodes trust between people unnecessarily, sows disharmony between the sexes, and warps the minds of the young (one can construct a realistic picture of how it could even increase occurrences of frustrated outbursts of male violence like mass murders, for example).

				The simple undeniable fact of the matter is that people reach peak sexual maturity, on average, sometime around their 14th year of life. Men who say they are not attracted to people 14-17 years old are saying that they are not attracted to fully sexually matured people, leading me to conclude that they must be pedophiles or asexuals.<br /><br />1. Men are attracted to potential sexual partners primarily based on physical appearance, primarily signs of fertility and sexual maturity<br />2. Men are typically attracted to signs of youth, as these are biological signals of fertility<br />3. People reach full sexual maturity (and females reach peak fertility), and appear to be sexually mature, on average, sometime around 14 years old<br />4. People who are 14 years old display many physical signs of youth, as they are young<br /><br />All of these facts can be backed up with hundreds of different citations, and the only conclusion we can form when taking these facts together is that neurotypical males are sexually attracted to underage teenagers. <br /><br />If most men are attracted to sexual partners based primarily on their physical appearance of sexual maturity and signs of fertility, and most people reach peak fertility and appear to be fully sexually mature when they are 14, then most men are attracted to 14 year olds.<br /><br />If the majority of A&#039;s are attracted to B&#039;s that are also C&#039;s, and the majority of D&#039;s are B&#039;s that are also C&#039;s, then the majority of A&#039;s are attracted to the majority of D&#039;s. <br /><br />If the majority of A&#039;s are attracted to B&#039;s that are also C&#039;s, and some D&#039;s are B&#039;s that are also C&#039;s, then the majority of A&#039;s are attracted to some D&#039;s.<br /><br />If the majority of A&#039;s are attracted to B&#039;s that are also C&#039;s, and all D&#039;s are B&#039;s but no D&#039;s are C&#039;s, then the majority of A&#039;s are not attracted to any D&#039;s.<br /><br />It is simple and obvious logic. And when we plug the variables with A = men, B&#039;s = people who appear youthful and C&#039;s = people who appear sexually mature, then you can see that plugging &#039;14-17 year olds&#039; for D reveals that most men are attracted to most people who are 14-17, plugging &#039;post pubescents that are not 14&#039; for D reveals that most men are attracted to some people who are pubescent but not 14, and plugging &#039;pre pubescent&#039; for D reveals that most men are not attracted to pre pubescent.<br /><br />The only way anybody can disprove what I have said is if they can prove one of the following<br /><br />1. Men are NOT primarily attracted to potential sexual partners based on physical appearance indicating fertility and sexual maturity<br />2. Men are NOT attracted to signs of youth<br />3. People do NOT reach full sexual maturity, on average, around 14 years of age<br />4. People who are below the age of 18 do NOT display many signs of youth<br />5. No people who are below the age of 14 have reached full sexual maturity<br />6. Some people who are pre pubescent have reached full sexual maturity<br /><br />So I suggest anybody wanting to argue with me runs off and finds a citation proving one of these points, because failure to do so essentially ensures that you will be arguing from an incorrect position.

Other than the past one hundred years or so, for all of human history it has been legal to engage in sexual intercourse with those who are not prepubescent. In much of the world it is still legal to engage in sexual interaction with those who are 13+ or 14+. We have been evolutionarily programmed to find 14-17 year olds sexually attractive, with the exception of the past one hundred or so years it has always been considered morally acceptable to have sexual relations with 14-17 year olds, and in the majority of the world it is legal to have sexual relationships with at least some segment of the people who fall between the ages of 14-17. Indeed, in several parts of the world it is legal to have sexual relationships with people who are below the age of 14. <br /><br />Only a tiny fraction of the men arrested on To Catch A Predator would have broken any laws if they lived in Spain, even living in Eastern Europe or much of Western Europe would have spared many of the men. In some parts of the USA men are labeled as sexual predators for engaging in behavior that is legal in other parts of the USA!

My moral principles are based on my conception of the good, not on utilitarian ethics.&nbsp; Consent has nothing intrinsically to do with moral determinations. If person X consents to be killed and eaten alive by person Y, it is still immoral, even if both parties obtain some kind of pleasure from the activity. Likewise, having sex with a 13 year old girl is bad, even if she consents to it and desires it, because it does not built virtue, but has a corrupting effect on the girl. Girls are already overly sexualised as it is.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t been &quot;conditioned&quot; to hold these opinions -- in fact, I used to be of the same opinion as you on this issue for many years. I don&#039;t base my opinions on social norms.&nbsp; I changed my mind on this issue because I have a better understanding the corrupting effects of intergenerational sex. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=169396.msg1271074#msg1271074">Quote from: kmfkewm on June 25, 2013, 12:06 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Other than the past one hundred years or so, for all of human history...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Not relevant.

				A common anecdotal theme I have noticed is that peoples opinions on this matter largely depend on the age they are.

The core of my argument is that people who can consent to have sex with each other should be allowed do engage in sexual relationships with each other. I suppose that we must then define what consent is. <br /><br />Consent is not just the ability to agree to do something - a five year old can be asked to engage in sexual activity and proceed to do so, however it is apparent that they do not have the ability to consent. The reason we would say that the five year old cannot consent is due to the fact that they do not comprehend the implications of what they are being asked to do. A bomb could be placed in a box with a button on it, configured such that if the button is pressed the bomb explodes. If I hand a person this box and ask them to press the button, it does not mean that they consent to be killed if they press the button. Consent requires a well rounded understanding of the potential consequences of a taken action.&nbsp; <br /><br />Consent is not just the taking of an action while understanding the potential consequences of the action. If I place a bomb in a box as before, although this time I explain the details of the scenario to the person whom I ask to press the button, they have not consented to press the button if they only do so because I am holding a gun to the head of one of their loved ones. Consent requires a true desire to take an action, independently of external coercion. This is not to say that a person cannot take actions they regret having to take to reach a certain goal. For example, a person who has a desperately impoverished family but who also has a life insurance policy, may have a true desire to commit suicide in order to provide for their family. They can consent to be shot even though they would prefer not to be, because their desire to provide for their family outweighs their desire to live. The difference is that, in the case of the intentional suicide, the person took action based on their own cognition (ie: the idea to commit suicide to save their family arose from their own mind, and was not forced upon them by the malicious actions of another). Admittedly the distinction is hard to qualify, however I believe that we can agree that consent requires a true desire to take an action and that the desire can not have been brought to be by the rights violating activity of another person. <br /><br />I believe that this enough to define consent. Consent is the taking of an action, while having a reasonable understanding of the potential consequences of the action, while having a true desire to take the action, without the desire stemming from the malicious rights violation of another party. Thus we can conclude that a person is capable of consenting to sex if they have a reasonable understanding of the potential consequences of engaging in sex and they still desire to engage in sex of their own free will. The reason rape is immoral is because inherently somebody who is raped does not desire to be raped of their own free will. Even if men are biologically programmed to desire rape, it is immoral to rape for the previously stated reason. A five year old is incapable of consenting to sex because they are incapable of having a reasonable understanding of (and appreciation for) the consequences of engaging in sexual activities. <br /><br />Your five year age gap clearly shows that consent is not the issue you have with underage sex. If a 14 year old is capable of understanding and appreciating the potential consequences of sex, and they still decide to engage in sexual activity of their own free will, then they are capable of consenting to sexual interaction with a 30 year old just as well as they are capable of consenting to engage in sexual activity with a 19 year old.&nbsp; My argument is that a 14 year old is capable of knowing and appreciating the potential consequences of sexual activity as well as naturally biologically programmed to desire to engage in sexual activity of their own free will. A five year old is not biologically programmed to desire to engage in sexual activity, any desire a five year old has to engage in sexual activity is going to be a desire that comes from coercion (and additionally a 5 year old is not capable of understanding and appreciating the potential consequences of engaging in sexual activity). In addition to a 14 year old being able to understand and appreciate the potential consequences of engaging in sexual activity, and being biologically programmed to desire to engage in sexual activity, males are biologically programmed to desire to engage in sexual activity with 14 year olds (as per my previous logical analysis of males desire for youth and fertility), and therefor it is not immoral for adult males to engage in sexual activity with 14 year olds. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ethics should focus on the virtue of an agent, on what makes a person virtuous. The purpose of virtue is to tend towards the Good.&nbsp; The cultivation of virtue elevates us above the level of animal existence to the human and to the divine.&nbsp; Having sex with underaged girls tends pulls them down to the animal level; it is a movement of the will towards the finite and materialism. We should be cultivating their virtues instead, rather than using them to satisfy our sexual desires, which corrupts both them and ourselves.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br />And again you like to use words without defining them. What is virtue? What makes a person virtuous. What is the property of being virtuous? Something that tends towards &#039;the good&#039;? What is the Good then? I assume the Good is the expression of virtue, since that would complete your circular logic. I also don&#039;t see anything immoral about the finite (whatever the hell you mean by that, I suppose), and I definitely don&#039;t see anything immoral with materialism. Also, 14 year olds also have sexual desires, as they are biologically programmed to.

				I get the feeling that kmfkewm either hasn&#039;t spent enough time around today&#039;s younger teens and experienced their unfortunate condition, or doesn&#039;t care and is just trying to justify his own sexual proclivities. Today&#039;s teenagers are products of the times - profoundly hedonistic, infantile and oversexualized, all of which makes for a disastrous combination. Adolescents of former times were far different creatures who were given adult responsibilities and values from authority figures beginning at a much earlier age, and thus possessed personal restraint -- a crucial difference and something that most teens and tweens today lack entirely. It is this restraint that rendered an age of consent law unnecessary in those times, and it wasn&#039;t until recently that that restraint faded away and had to be replaced by legal restraint from the outside.<br /><br />With today&#039;s culture it is just irresponsible to set young emotionally immature people out to be taken advantage of by experienced players. If it were something like arranged marriage or any sort of enforced commitment I don&#039;t think it would be as much of a problem. Otherwise it&#039;s just a recipe for creating emotionally damaged people.<br /><br />The age of consent in my state is 16, which I believe is reasonable. To lower it or even eliminate it entirely would be reckless and a disservice to our already troubled children.<br /><br />Age of consent laws are one of the last institutional barriers to degeneracy that still exist. Keep them on the books.

Clearly people who have no biological drive to engage in sexual activity should not be manipulated into engaging in sexual activity, and that draws a pretty firm minimum line at about 12.

You have given no reason for why 16 years old is the appropriate age other than that an arbitrary line needs to be drawn somewhere, and it seems like quite a coincidence to me that the arbitrary line your morality dictates you to draw happens to perfectly coincide with the legal system of your community. I find it highly unlikely that your line would be at 16 years old if you happened to have been born in Spain or Croatia for example. Unless you would still think the age of consent should be 16 even if you were born somewhere where the age of consent is lower or higher, then clearly your sense of morality is the result of social conditioning.

				I think there is a point here that both of you are missing. For the same reason that a boss shouldn&#039;t sleep with his employee and a teacher with his student, there is a power differential between an adult and an adolescent, even someone 14 or 15 years old, that calls into question whether they truly consent, even if they are capable of doing so.<br /><br />In many places, the law takes this into account. It&#039;s legal for two underage people to have sex, as long as they are not more than 2 years apart in age, for example. So a 15 year old and a 17 year old can have sex, but a 15 year old and a 24 hear old can&#039;t. That makes sense to me.<br />

				In many places the law takes this into account by forbidding teachers from sleeping with their students, or bosses from sleeping with their employees of a certain age, even though somebody who is not the teacher or boss of the person can still legally sleep with them. If power difference is your main concern it would seem that this is a better solution than arbitrary age restrictions. There is a huge power differential between a billionaire adult male and a poor adult female, should we forbid them from sleeping together as well? The issue boils down entirely to consent, and if a 14 year old can consent to sleep with a 14 year old then a 14 year old can consent to sleep with a 30 year old.

				To catch a predator is funny somtimes.<br /><br />I like the guy who gets caught twice and then says &#039;ooops&#039;<br /><br />Seriously though - I&#039;ve worked with teenage girls - they are predatory but you got to remember - even though they might imitate being women - they are still children and adults have a duty of care. <br /><br />And on that show, some of the &#039;bait&#039; is 12, 13 which is paedophile territory. <br /><br />I think any guy who hits up on an underage girl online is a bit of an idiot.<br /><br />But, in defence of some, I&#039;d have to say if I was 17 again, a 15 yr old girl is hardly a child. But if your over 30 - its a NO GO. <br /><br />And as a father, what would you do if some 50 yr old turned up to &#039;hang out&#039; with your 12 yr old? I&#039;ll be honest, I&#039;d tyre jack the son of a dog.<br /><br />I got to say, the &#039;Perverted Justice&#039; team look a bit creepy. But as for entrapment, sorry, if your hitting on a 12 yr old - your either an imbecile or need your dick severing. <br /><br />There is a comedy clip with the &#039;To Catch a Predator&#039; presenter being entrapped into a prize acceptance. <br /><br />There are a few funny moments such as the fainting Asian guy or the naked Asian guy. <br /><br />I like they way the presenter says &#039;put em on the table&#039; in reference to condoms, lube and other things.<br /><br />Hope they don&#039;t start doing To Catch a Hash Smoker&#039;.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I admit, I&#039;d be all over any good hash!

				Yeah they are idiots beyond any doubt. It is a stupid risk to take, at least from my perspective. A lot of them don&#039;t seem to be exclusive ephebophiles or hebephiles either, although for the ones who are I guess I can understand why they would take such a risk. If they are trying to meet up with 12 year olds or 13 year olds I don&#039;t feel so bad for them, although they are still clearly no where near as bad as someone trying to fuck a 5 or 6 year old. I think the law in USA differentiates between over 12 and under 12, as well as over 16 and under 16 in the states that have an age of consent over 16. I mostly just feel bad for the ones who get busted trying to fuck 14+ year olds though, particularly so if they are 16+ considering that is legal in the majority of the USA as well as the vast majority of the world. It makes no sense that somebody doing something in one state is a sexual predator, but somebody doing the same thing just a few miles away across state lines is considered to be normal. Then again, it doesn&#039;t make much sense that somebody doing something in Spain should be considered normal while somebody doing the same thing in the USA is considered a dangerous sexual predator. It is very arbitrary and people tend to just go along with whatever their own microscopic community has predetermined for them, even if they claim otherwise. Obviously pretty close to nobody wants their 12 year old daughter to have sex with some 50 year old, but it seems strange to me that people seem to think that 12 year olds want to have sex with 50 year olds in the first place. 99 percent of the time I imagine that if a 50 year old proposes sex with a 12 year old, the 12 year old will be disgusted and probably freak out about it. Hell, in most cases a 20 year old wouldn&#039;t want to have sex with a 50 year old.
