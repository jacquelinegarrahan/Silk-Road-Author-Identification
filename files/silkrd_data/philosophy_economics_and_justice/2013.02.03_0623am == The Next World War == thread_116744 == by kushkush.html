				agreed<br />there is a lot of tension around the world. I think china and japan are all of a sudden not getting along again, which does seem uncomfortably like a pretense to something<br />Israel&#039;s Bibi netenyahu is practically foaming at the mouth by now about killing some Muslims , my god that man is mad... <br />All the Islamic countries continue to get hit by flung dung from the west, dont seem too happy about it... the recent israel bombing in syria? Iran and russia didnt think very well of that...<br />Germany and many others are &quot;realizing&quot; there is something up with their gold being held at the federal reserve... more tension..<br /><br />if not a big war, there will be massive civil unrest/discontent.

Iran is so far away from starting a war it&#039;s such a joke how much the western media (and Israeli and Israeli-friendly politicians which includes pretty much all US politicians) have hyped up the whole charade. Even if they did have nukes, which they don&#039;t, they have vast oil wealth and plenty to lose by starting a war with Israel/US/NATO. The ayatollah is not some apocalyptic madman bent on self destruction, but a politician looking at self preservation just like every other world leader in spite of what the hasbara trolls would have you believe.<br /><br />North Korea OTOH has far less to lose because they&#039;re a poverty stricken country whose citizens eat grass to survive. A few more sanctions, or maybe China cutting them off, could easily make their great leader try and start a war to keep the regime from imploding. And they already have nukes. So why isn&#039;t there all this hype about North Korea? Because Israel does not see North Korea as their mortal enemy. It&#039;s ridiculous how anyone actually buys into the hype about Iran. Although I see WWIII as unlikely, the greater threat to start a war than North Korea OR Iran is Israel. Without a doubt. If Iran does eventually go nuclear it will be because of the constant provocations of Israel that they felt the need to do so to protect themselves. Any country would feel persecuted after having their military installations sabotaged and nuclear scientists assassinated on their own soil. <br /><br />/rant off

				I think a conflict between China and Russia is possible. China is expanding rapidly as we all know, however as climate change becomes more severe over the next fifty years, much of Chinas prime agricultural land will move northwards.

And because of the certainty of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) it&#039;s been an unbroken truism so far that nuclear powers don&#039;t fight hot wars against each other. I would think this would be especially true between two nuclear giants like Russia and China. <br /><br />Furthermore, the perceived threat of US imperialism always at their doorstep should be enough to keep them unified.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or the major world powers could squabble over the remaining oil resources....oh wait that&#039;s already happening!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually this has really become much less of a concern over the last few years because of the technological advances to exploiting shale oil and gas. The US is poised to overtake Saudi Arabia as the world&#039;s largest oil producer by 2017, a net oil exporter by 2030, and self-sufficient by 2035. Hard to believe but you can look it up as confirmed by western energy agencies and the IAEA. <br /><br />And as we all know, the fight for oil is the primary reason for the heavy involvement of the US military in the Middle East.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> Those of you who think a worldwide old fashioned war is unlikely have just been lulled into a false sense of security by the 70 odd years of relative peace(and only by living in our insulated gated communities, the western &#039;democracys&#039; ).

				Yeah I take your point that the threat of nuclear weapons makes it difficult to imagine large scale conventional warfare between nuclear powers. It&#039;s kind of an uneasy peace though.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The extraction of oil from oil shales and continued reliance on burning fossil fuels however is only going to accelerate the disruptive effects of climate change. My concern is that ever increasing world population combined with increasingly unreliable weather affecting harvests and water resources will lead to conflicts. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously the next &quot;world war&quot; will not resemble the previous two. The concept of a &quot;world war&quot; is fairly hazy.

				Y&#039;all motherfuckas be trippin&#039;. I can&#039;t definitively say that there won&#039;t be a world war in the future, but it seems VERY unlikely to happen during any of our lifetimes. Why you ask? <br /><br />1. Because we live in the age of &quot;mutually assured destruction&quot; policies, where any global war between two nuclear-armed superpowers effectively destroys them both. This formed the narrative during the Cold War (although there were inadvertently numerous close calls due to paranoia/technological failures) and it&#039;s even more true now. No one, not even North Korea, wants to actually use their nukes. They simply want the political leverage that comes along with them. <br /><br />2. Because of the strengthening economic ties between countries. This is especially important when talking about Chinese and U.S. relations. Why would either country want to start ANYTHING with their biggest trading partner?! <br /><br />3. Because we&#039;ve become an increasingly more globalized world, especially with the advent of the internet age. When you can talk to people around the globe instantaneously, it becomes more difficult for governments to pit us against one another. Compare that to five or six decades ago, when the passing of information was measured in HOURS/DAYS, not milliseconds. <br /><br />Simply put, it ain&#039;t gonna happen, at least not in the next hundred years or so. No one&#039;s going to sacrifice billions of lives and the economic stability of the world for minor political gains and/or religious convictions.

You made some other good points that I hadn&#039;t mentioned yet like with China, which is undeniably true. +1 :) It&#039;s because of MAD that I wouldn&#039;t mind at all if Iran got the bomb, even if it did spark a nuclear arms race among other ME powers. That might even things up a bit instead of having the entire region dominated by Israel and fear of Israel.

				Smaller countries will be the spark, the big powers will get dragged into it because of treaties and pacts.<br />If Israel starts a conflict with Iran or Syria then the USA will get involved, and Russia possibly.<br />What if Turkey got involved in an Israeli spat, EU partners would have to support Turkey against Israel and what would USA do then?<br />Bigger surprises than the above have swept the middle east in the last few years, nukes won&#039;t stop a war any more.

They&#039;ve wanted membership for quite some time so as to gain protection under the NATO umbrella from encroaching Russian influences (and to adopt the Euro) but have always been thwarted by anti-Muslim alarmism, the last time a few years ago when Sarkozy drummed up a frenzy of anti-immigrant xenophobia.<br /><br />Nor is Turkey suicidal in getting into a confrontation with Israel, especially when they consider the US an ally they don&#039;t want to lose for lack of a whole lot of friends since that would also antagonize the EU, and it&#039;s not like they&#039;re particularly fond of Russia. Despite being predominantly Muslim they have long traditions as a secular society that they have a strong interest in wanting to keep in contrast to other Muslim countries. They&#039;ve also got internal issues with Kurdish separatists that they&#039;d be dumb asses not to resolve before even thinking about a protracted external conflict.<br /><br />Can&#039;t see Turkey seeking a death wish even if Erdogan is a megalomaniac as Israel would have you believe.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Bigger surprises than the above have swept the middle east in the last few years, nukes won&#039;t stop a war any more.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nukes really only stop wars against other countries with nukes. Doesn&#039;t mean wars won&#039;t be fought by countries wanting to hold onto the power by preventing other countries from getting nukes as, ahem, we&#039;re familiar with the obvious culprits.
