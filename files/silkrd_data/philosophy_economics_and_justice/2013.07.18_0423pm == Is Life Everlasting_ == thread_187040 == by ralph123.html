				Has anyone saw this vid?<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0gBoV0ygJc<br /><br />How many people think it&#039;s a bunch of bull shit and how many people think it&#039;s close to the truth?<br /><br />As for me I don&#039;t know I don&#039;t care<br /><br />I did an experiment where I tried to make every word I said come out as a song or a tune but not noticeable to others. The results were mind boggling. It was like people could understand me a lot better as well as they could hear me better and they responded with actions more to my liking.<br /><br />it&#039;s very psychedelic

				There are two meanings of &#039;everlasting&#039; -- a state that goes on forever and ever WITHIN time, and a state that is simply unconditioned by time. <br /><br />Life is &#039;everlasting&#039; in the latter sense. There is the day that passes, and there is the complete day. The future eternally &#039;exists&#039;.

				I believe that we all have an everlasting soul. I think life is a big spiritual school, everyone in different spiritual grade levels, all taking tests and pop quizzes. I&#039;ve tried to meditate, but every time I try, I&#039;ll get an itch on my nose or somewhere else, or there will be some other external distraction. That&#039;s why DMT is sooooo attractive to me. I&#039;m planning on a DMT journey soon!&nbsp;

				Chicagodogs:&nbsp; I want to encourage you to continue in your path of developing your ability to meditate.&nbsp; If your mind alerts, let it do so and then fade away again.&nbsp; That&#039;s okay.&nbsp; Thoughts, passing like little leaves down the stream of your consciousness.&nbsp; Just return to base.&nbsp; Breathe comfortably.&nbsp; Perhaps mantra recitation can be fruitful for you?<br /><br />Furthermore, in the way of supplying DMT into your bloodstream, you may notice that your background in meditation will easily allow you to be transformed by said DMT.&nbsp; You will supply not the action of crossing through the veil.&nbsp; I am reminded of the adage, &quot;The quieter you become, the more you can hear.&quot;<br /><br />Ever read Ram Dass?

				Unconscious life is everlasting. A materialist atheist may claim that you just cease to exist when you die. That is to say PUFF you disappear. That is as magical as any religion.<br /><br />I&#039;m neither religious nor atheist. I am the God of my perspective and my universe. When I die my body will give birth to the earth which gives life to the plants, which is food for animals, and humans. My body is everlasting. If you are a materialist then you consider your body as being you. Your body remains when you die and is decomposed into other material things. Thus you remain after you die.<br /><br />The conscious mind on the other hand is the unknown. I have my own theories. Ultimately I think you live on in some form that is incomprehendable to the human consciousness so there is no point in debating between religious and atheists. Just accept the inevitability of death which comes from your birth and live this life as if it&#039;s your last. And then if it&#039;s not you will be pleasantly surprised :)

				I had a mystical experience after a 3 day binge on RC&#039;s ( I have no idea which ones i took, or which 1 triggered the hallucinations). I saw creatures from other dimensions, the devil, Jesus on a cross and witches in my TV. Obviously these were drug induced hallucinations, and i&#039;d still class myself as agnostic, but it&#039;s strengthened my view that there are things in this (and maybe other) universe(s), which modern science cannot explain.

				Everlasting Life?&nbsp; Depends on what you consider life.&nbsp; Actually it doesn&#039;t matter what you consider life.&nbsp; It&#039;s true that all the matter there is was created during the big bang and it just keeps getting regurgitated.&nbsp; We (our bodies) are a collection of that regurgitation.&nbsp; However, our conscious mind is not a physical property and I think that is what you are referring to.&nbsp; My belief is that the conscious mind operates on an off/on switch, the brain, which completely and independently fabricates the conscious mind, where we mentally live.&nbsp; &nbsp;This conscious space is a matrix, not unlike the movie, except ours is biologically based.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of our sensory inputs receive outside data and our brain interprets these stimuli and presents a fabricated reality to &quot;us&quot;, to our thinking, conscious minds.&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no such thing as color.&nbsp; It only exists in our minds.&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything we see is a reflection, a mirror, except those things that can shine on their own.&nbsp; You don&#039;t actually see objects, but rather their reflection.&nbsp; Your mind fills in about 80% of your periphery vision with color that you can&#039;t even perceive because you have no cones with which to see color, only rods which perceive black and white.&nbsp; Yet when you stare straight ahead. you see color in 180 degrees...but it&#039;s not there.&nbsp; &nbsp;Have someone take a brightly colored object and stand behind you.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look straight ahead as they bring the object into your field of vision, from the side and toward the front of your field of vision.&nbsp; &nbsp;You won&#039;t be able to tell the color of that object until it is about in the 2 o&#039;clock position as you stare straight ahead.&nbsp; &nbsp;The optical nerve and the network that radiates out from the base creates a blind spot the size of silver dollar at arms length plus a number of blind branches emanating from it.&nbsp; None of you see anything in these areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your mind fills it all in for you.&nbsp; When we experience de ja vu, what is actually happening is the brain is stuttering and restarts its reality transmission in milliseconds.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are re-presented the same reality picture and overcome with a feeling of having the experience before, because you did, just miliseconds ago.&nbsp; There are tons and tons of examples like this.&nbsp; We experience a manufactured reality.&nbsp; We are not in control.&nbsp; Our brains are in control.&nbsp; The conscious mind is a tiny subset of what&#039;s going on in the brain.&nbsp; &nbsp;It may very well be that we think of as being alive, isn&#039;t -- it doesn&#039;t exist, and therefore we don&#039;t either, not in the conscious sense.<br /><br />Some feel that consciousness is actually a &quot;dumbed down&quot; experience, not the higher order mechanism we all think it is.&nbsp; Now, that isn&#039;t to say that hasn&#039;t been a useful feature, it certainly has been a fantastic evolutionary advancement and put us right at the top of the heap as a species.&nbsp; But it doesn&#039;t make us any more special than that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does anyone here know what&#039;s going on in your pancreas right now?&nbsp; Anybody feel that polyp growing in your intestine.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to attack that cell that just went rogue before it splits and becomes a tumor using your white blood cell army?&nbsp; Can anyone explain why Red + Green = Yellow?&nbsp; Do you see red in yellow?&nbsp; Green?&nbsp; <br /><br />There was a trippy theory sometime back before they started finding more purpose in the DNA strand.&nbsp; When it was first coded, a very large percentage (like 2/3) was called &quot;Junk DNA&quot; because it didn&#039;t appear to have any useful function, it was considered an evolutionary leftover without a contemporary purpose.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is now known not to be true.&nbsp; But back then there was some murmuring, a fucking weird ass &quot;what if&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;What if this &quot;Junk DNA&quot; was the sole purpose of existence?&nbsp; What if we are just hosts for this junk DNA?&nbsp; Hmmm.... <br /><br />

				Those 21 grams you will lose if you die is bullocks.<br />Show me a scientific publication!<br /><br />The 90% water in your body is old. like the iron and chalk.<br />Every partical is at least 500 million years old.<br /><br />So you are 500 million years old, but the fire/spark of life is starting when the sperm enters the egg.<br /><br />So your hardware has always been there and will ever be there. It&#039;s the spark of live that you have to pass trough (kids)<br /><br />The purpose of live, every live. Take a plant, is to make kids (seeds). The plant grows to only to make a flower, so it can make seeds. Then it&#039;s job is done. So it is. Like the fish salmon or human. Be born, reproduce and die.

				When I was younger I used to be absolutely terrified of the thought of just not existing when I died. In fact I was more terrified of there being to life after death than I was of going to Hell.<br /><br />All it really takes is some deeper thought though. Complete oblivion after death isn&#039;t bad at all. It seems scary, but when you think about it, what is there to be scared of? What is there to feel anything about? The idea of nothing is so completely foreign to us that it seems terrifying, but in reality, it&#039;s impossible for it to be fun or scary, pleasurable or painful. If you can come to terms with the fact that contemplating what happens after we die is essentially a pointless endeavor, then you can be even more free to live the life you have to the fullest!

I am determined to perform actions within the capabilities of my body as a human. My genetics are about 50% those of my family and so there was some predeterminism as to how I would be shaped as a being. My upbringing determined how intelligent I would become. I believe we are on a determined path but the path has many alternatives endings based on what paths we choose in life (which differentiates determinism with fatalism). Determinism is the view that it must be that, if earlier determining conditions obtain then the determined event will occur. <br /><br />The fallacy of free will has an evolutionary advantage of conferring the illusion of responsibility. So it&#039;s probably a good thing that people don&#039;t realise this ;)

				If Endless Life exists and it is Eternal as the Hindus believe, if you then perceive that Existence to be a form of slavery then Buddhism offers Annihilation and an end to the Wheel of Samsara.<br /><br />Physicists have argued that very little of the atomic matter of the Earth leaves the gravity well.&nbsp; So whatever people think about hovering or going to outer space, it was probably their mental software dealing with their physical hardware shutting down.&nbsp; 22 grams or whatever doesn&#039;t leave the gravity well of Earth.<br /><br />The question becomes: Is it possible that evolution is the universe trying to perceive itself as painlessly as possible?<br /><br />What if we modify our personal behavior to correspond more with the resonance of the universe, or nature, or society, or your family, etc.&nbsp; Flow with the resonance....&nbsp; Then we see that the path of least resistence actually decreases suffering here and now, whether life is eternal or not.<br />

				Some serious scientists believe that there are an infinite number of &quot;yous&quot;, in an infinite number of universes, all slightly different.

				Even if death means oblivion doesn&#039;t necessarily mean we should fear it. We&#039;ve all experienced it before we were born and it was neither a positive or a negative - just neutral. I do, however, yearn to believe that there is something (anything) after death, but it is a question which can never be proven, either by science or religion, so maybe we shouldn&#039;t concern ourselves with what happens when we die.

				When you die on Earth, you are reborn as a new life form on another planet, and you lose all memory of your past lives and experiences.&nbsp; Jesus the Christ was an alien who came to the Jews to tell them that they were once part of a species of alien that lived on gold(as food).&nbsp; But in their human form, they have to actually survive on matza and diamonds.&nbsp; Later, the Romans would take to the words of Christ as fact, and proof of God because they saw the Jews consumption of Matza and precious gems come to fruition. Thus, the Vatican is in Rome.&nbsp; Well, not &#039;really&#039; Rome, they call it Vatican City.&nbsp; But we all know it&#039;s Rome.<br /><br />Moral of the story is that in 1907, it was proven that the Soul is worth about 3 quarters of weed.<br /><br />And that Hell is real.
