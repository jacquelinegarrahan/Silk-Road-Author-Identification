				So I got into this whole SR thing because I wanted some drugs. Since I&#039;ve been here, I&#039;ve been reading the forums on a very regular basis. I&#039;ve educated myself about encryption and all things security. And I&#039;m now starting to see what a lot of you have been talking about. How we are all part of a bigger picture. That this is not just drug website, its a revolution.<br /><br />It just kind of hit me today. One of those give-you-goosebumps moments. And I wasn&#039;t even high. Oh wait.... yeah I was :P<br /><br />Anyway, its pretty fucking cool to be a part of this movement. I&#039;m proud to be a crypto-anarchist with all of you.<br /><br />And in the words of Gil Scott-Heron.... The revolution will not be televised!

				Not all hip to tor reach enlightenment so easily; and the biggest impingement is their insecurities. <br /><br />Nobody comfortable with who they are would go out and mess with other people&#039;s lives; I feel like every radical conservative / anybody who has an agenda that seems to unfairly suppress another population, does so as a result of a childish insecurity, lashing out from the depths of their immature soul. Even greed and conquest, are only sought by those unable to appreciate / be happy with their own existence.

You refer to radical conservatives, yet leave out liberals. I think the only champions of liberty are conservatives. Lest your forget, the prohibition of drugs happened as a result of the progressive movement, a liberal movement.<br /><br />The &quot;conservatives&quot; who wish to limit freedom (abortion comes to mind here) typically do so out of religious, not political beliefs. Should you wish to expand this conversation, I can explain why I am a pro choice, pro gay marriage conservative, and have conservative reasons, not liberal ones, for coming to my conclusions. Actually, not much expansion is needed. A always defer to the option which limits the size and scope of government. I don&#039;t agree with abortion, but I dislike more a government that has the power to tell a person they cannot have one.

				<br />interesting points.<br /><br />i read somewhere that television was the revolution, and those on the wrong side of it will never wake from their hypnotic state until they have a NDE or LSD.<br /><br />i also read that the internet was another revolution.<br /><br />perhaps there are revolutions every moment somewhere &amp; unless they can be manipulated into a breaking story/more rights reductions, they will indeed not be televised

				Have teens posted anymore Salvia/LSD/Shroom/DOx trips on YouTube? I haven&#039;t been outside of TOR in a long time... No streaming videos for me... just words and drugs and more words.<br /><br />The Revolution will be televised when it turns bloody. Syria has really good violence streaming via satellite. Boston Marathon was televised. 9/11 was televise. Good violence is always televised.<br /><br />No violence = No Airtime<br /><br />How sick is that?
