				I think American&#039;s need to take a page out of their book and begin their own civil war, many other nations as well. <br /><br />I have no idea who is firing chemical weapons against whom over in Syria.

				Hard to form an opinion on this topic because of my personal lack of info.. But I DO find it interesting that the US has taken measures to sensor the voices that are heard out of Syria, with the social media hacking that has been going and the allegations being made.

				thank to hear your opinion.<br />And I agree with jackofspades that more country should start a revolution. <br />And I did not know that the US government was censoring the information about the war in Syria.<br /><br />Well as far I know there are 2 faction one the Syrian Free Army and a collection of Islamic faction fighting the oppress dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Assad who is back by Iran and the terrorist organization know as Hezbollah. <br />And are making good progress most of the northern part of the country is under there control.

				Violent civil wars are the best source of snuff, IMO. Syria has the monopoly on the snuff market right now.

				As an American, I feel the US should stay out of Syria. Just like we should have stayed out of countless other Middle East affairs. The whole &quot;Arab Spring&quot; was the biggest foreign policy disaster to date. The Obama administration refers to the anti-government groups of these countries as &quot;rebels&quot;, giving these groups some sort of righteous credibility. In every case, we&#039;ve assisted in taking out leaders, sometimes assassinating them. This went unchallenged by the robots in the US Press.&nbsp; <br /><br />This allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to take over, setting up an even more oppressive regime, of a bunch of 6th century throwbacks. It boggles the mind how the Obama regime gets away with this, with no protest from the American media, which has dissolved into nothing more than stenographers and defenders for this administration. <br /><br />Who can forget Secy of State Hillary Clinton&#039;s gauche gloating over the murder of the late Muslim strongman Muammar Gaddafi telling a reporter, &quot;We Came, We Saw, He died&quot; and then laughing with that psychotic cackle of hers. - A new low in American Foreign Policy. Again ignored by the sycophants in the media.&nbsp; <br /><br />This insanity of our involvement goes all the way back to the 2nd worst President in US history, Jimmy Carter, who along with Zbigniew Brzezinski worked to oust the Shah, putting in the Ayatollah Khomeni who&#039;d been living in exile after previous attempts working with Communist Russia to overthrow the Shah. <br /><br />Modern Iran could have been an “island of stability” in the Middle East, but instead got turned into a theocracy, by a man who took away women&#039;s rights, burned books, and had any political dissenters, murdered, by the thousands. <br /><br />America is now at war in five countries, soon to spread to 7. After that, if Brzezinski’s prayers are answered, both Russia and China will enter the fray as both David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski giggle, excitedly, like a couple of filthy gay pedophile priests.<br /><br />As Brzezinski’s plans for WWIII are working out perfectly, the vast majority of Americans continue to sleep.

				redfunguy<br /><br />I dont know where you get your information from. But go get your source straight. It was the other way around.&nbsp; The Syrian Army (the army of the government) was ordered to use chemical weapons against the Free Syrian Army. You must have been tripping when you heard this information. The general that was ordered to do this defected. And more on that the governments army has mean using using surface to air missiles to target civilians in the <br />north part of the country just be cause the rebelled against the government. <br />Then most of the soldier of the Free Syrian Army are defectors for the Government Army. Like I said go get your source straight. You must be getting you information for the CIA.
