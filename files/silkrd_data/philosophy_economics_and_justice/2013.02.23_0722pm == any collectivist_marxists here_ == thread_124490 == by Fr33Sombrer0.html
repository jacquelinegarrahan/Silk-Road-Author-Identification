				i really think they do a good enough job of that alone<br />that was kind of the point of this post<br /><br />there is no possible way to exist without partaking in some form of free market transaction. so any complete denial of the free market carries with it a complete denial of the very way in which human beings assign value to objects.

Nowhere did i say inventors were selfish. You made many assumptions without thinking about what i said more deeply. Although i respect your opinion, hopefully you are compassionate enough to respect mine. As for the whole money thing i think most of us here have the pretty basic concept that you explained to me down. The point i was trying to make is there are more important things than money. I get this opinion from comparing the happiness levels of say a poor Chinese rice farmer and an extremely wealthy business man. I may not be the same but hey that&#039;s not important. I don&#039;t believe you understood exactly what i was trying to say, sometimes i forget that we aren&#039;t all on the same page. I also realize my use of the English language isn&#039;t the greatest in the world =D. My sincere apologies.

				For the record I think a distinction should always be made between &quot;capitalism&quot; and free markets.&nbsp; Most people I know would consider the current US economy a capitalist one but it&#039;s obviously nowhere near a free market.&nbsp; It&#039;s a mixed market at best.<br /><br />Truly free markets are difficult to find although some places might be close (some might argue that SR is close).&nbsp; Most of the Marxists that I know are (somewhat) against centralized authority so I try not to pick fights with them.&nbsp; Anarcho-syndicalists and voluntarists fighting is exactly what the government wants.
