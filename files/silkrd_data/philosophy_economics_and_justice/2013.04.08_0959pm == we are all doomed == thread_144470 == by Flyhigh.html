				Wow ... this is A LOT of good info.&nbsp; Thank you for posting all of this. +1<br /><br />If you come around the DMT thread ever, you know I&#039;m a big proponent of salvia.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been smoking it for about 8 years, and have been on 200--300 trips, and the descriptions provided here are very accurate.&nbsp; Yerba Maria gets skipped over too often, but she is a major player when it comes to the psychedelics.&nbsp; Highly encourage anyone reading to give her a try.

				+1 for a great deal of information! I for one find it an affront to nature that Salvinorin isn&#039;t available on tabs! It has a microrange dosage, it is absorbed through tissue in the mouth (or lungs) and its legal in most countries. Is it possible? The extraction process might be difficult, maybe synthesis would be an alternative? I also wonder if anyone else would be interested in salvia blotters? I haven&#039;t tried a chew-trip, but I&#039;ve heard that it tastes god awful. Going to try to get my hands om some strong salvia in the near future. A very interesting plant!
