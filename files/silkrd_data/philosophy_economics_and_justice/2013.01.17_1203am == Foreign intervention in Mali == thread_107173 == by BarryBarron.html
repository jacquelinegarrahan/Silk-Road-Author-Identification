				As the question states.<br /><br />In recent weeks France and nations from the African Union have sent military forces to intervene on behalf of the Malian government, allegedly against an radical islamist al-qaeda affiliate. UK and US forces are also assisting with logistical support.<br />Discuss.

				Well, this is a situation that almost requires the words french and courageous to be mentioned in one sentence :)<br /><br />France seems to be doing its former colony a huge service here, which i find commendable. <br /><br />Involvement of my own country (netherlands) so far seems mostly irrelevant. We only grant some support infrastructure as is agreed upon between european countries. France has not requested any assistance on the battlefield from its NATO allies at this point. If it does come to that point, i suppose we should render assistance where feasible, perhaps in the form of providing AWACS aircraft, anti-missile systems to provide french-malinese bases and such. <br /><br />After all, we have been protected due to the french and english nuclear capabilities so far as well. While i firmly believe holland should develop its own nuclear weapons program (since we have all the means required to do so), i feel we should back our nato partners if they request it. They have not done so in the Mali conflict, but its important to show cooperation in the nato framework in general, for example by stationing patriot missile defense systems in turkey in case syria tries something down there.

				I didn&#039;t really see an alternative except a government bullied by radical islamic extremists taking control of the area, so I think France&#039;s decision was commendable. I also think France&#039;s motives were innocent, as this was about ensuring stability in the region and nothing else. <br /><br />Would I want the U.S. to become a part of the conflict? I don&#039;t know, is that even necessary at this point? Seems like France has presently maintained the peace.

				Banning music isn&#039;t that uncommon in extermist islam though, the taliban in the middle east ban it too. <br /><br />I suppose this ban isn&#039;t that black and white though - it doesn&#039;t usually apply to playing instruments in live performances and such, but the goal is mostly to keep music from being played back on cd players and such. Who knows what bad ideas the population may get from listening to a couple of usb-copied western albums after all.

				I&#039;m french, i read french newspapers but also sometimes foreign ones.<br /><br />I just can&#039;t find a word about all the &quot;media lies&quot;, about what you guys said.<br />My english is not good enough to explain quickly why all of this is bullshit.<br />A guy explains it very well, but in french - he&#039;s a independent belgian journalist who&#039;s not anymore accepted<br />on french tv because of the reality he speaks about wars (especially). He&#039;s Michel Collon (there&#039;s some subtitled videos on youtube, look at it, it&#039;s great - but not yet about Mali)<br /><br />In spite of my english, i&#039;ll try quickly :<br />It&#039;s all about war propaganda.<br />First one is to hide interest. <br />There is Gold, Gas, Petrol and Uranium in Mali. Who extracts it ? Foreign multinational - Bouygues for example (which detains TF1 - the first channel of french TV). Work conditions are horrible. <br /><br />Second one is to modify or hide History :<br />Each time, an african leader genuinely wanted to distribute the wealth of his country to the population, he got executed (exactly like in South America, you can read Howard Zinn&#039;s book, an american historian).<br />That&#039;s what happened in Mali just after the independence, Lumumba was murdered by Us, France and Belgium.<br />Then Modibo Keita was elected, he was a good guy, against colonial multinational (especially french ones).<br />France organized a &quot;coup d&#039;état&quot; (putsch) and put in prison where he died and replaced him by Moussa Traoré, a bloody dictator - who stayed 23 years -&nbsp; in the pocket of french business (but not only). And again and again...<br />France has NEVER protected Malians !&nbsp; <br /><br />Third one is to claim to be a victim or to help them - that&#039;s not true. The actual interim president is a marionette as CEDAO is.<br />Population has manifested against France to be military involved.<br /><br />Fourth is to demonize the opponents (i&#039;m not defending islamists, our countries, in a way, created them or at least let them be).<br /><br />And to finish, monopolize and prevent any public debate.<br /><br />Sorry, don&#039;t have time to correct myself and i admit it&#039;s a bit short but fuckin true.<br /><br />CHEERS<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I suppose there are multiple ways to look at this.<br /><br />So far it seems that france is coming to the aid of the government of its former colony, at their request. Fossil fuel interests probably do play a role in that, even if that involves no more than allowing production to continue without ceasing anything produced. The french intervention is not comparable in any way to the gulf war between america and irak.

				First of all, the recognized government of Mali has welcomed the French aid. This is not comparable to a country like qatar that has never requested or accepted foreign aid in curtailing a problem - not that it even has one comparable to the situation in mali.<br /><br />As far as what the population actually wants: if you want to obey that, the country should probably be split in half life sudan, with the northern part adopting islam, sharia and such, and the southern half continuing business as usual. This could be an option, though it may drive most of the countries to split into two halves over time. But even after splitting in half, its likely there will be territorial disputes between the islamic north and free south that will take both time and exchange of gunfire to resolve over a very long period of time.

				The response is low because how the question was formulated though.<br /><br />MY government should not take part in this war, as i live in the netherlands, and mali never asked for any help. France, on the other hand, has answered a call for help from its former colony, and decided to answer it. I doubt anyone in a country that has not been asked for help would suggest their military intervene in a conflict they have nothing to do with in the first place. <br /><br />Meanwhile the french army seems to be making good headway in mali. The stereotype may be that the french will surrender when pointed at with a blunt stick, but in this case their technological superiority could very well end this conflict quite rapidly. After all, if your army consists of machine guns on the back of pickup trucks, you&#039;d be very unpleasantly surprised to see such units destroyed by a mirage fighter jet that you can&#039;t even see or hear yet.

				As for the dutch involvement, our ally France requested some transport services for materials and troops, which our government provided as is very common within the european execution of NATO obligations. There are no dutch soldiers fighting in Mali, the only thing the Netherlands did was providing several large transport aircraft to the french to allow them to bring equipment and staff into the government controlled part of Mali.<br /><br />Sharing all kinds of resources is common between European nations. Dutch patriot missile defense systems are also deployed in turkey to defend against any Syrian missile or air attack on southern turkey. Unlike america that has all its combat resources under one flag, in europe some systems are operated by a limited number of countries to control costs, but they are made available to all nato allies if requested.

				Let&#039;s look at the main event following up to France&#039;s intervention in Mali: Germany pulled all of their gold in both French and American reserves. Not even a week later, they started reporting &quot;attacks from Mali militants kills blah blah blah&quot;. After enough propaganda to convince the sheeple was spread, France went in for that sweet Malian gold. There&#039;s really no other reason for intervention in any country other than resource gain. One self-evident fact to back that up: central Africa--i.e., Sudan, Somalia, etc-- has been seeing despotic militarism for decades now, and everyone&#039;s just looked the other way and are still doing so today. Sucks that you can&#039;t stop the machine with just a few gear going the other way :/

				There often is some economic benefit indeed - access to extract gold, oil, or whatever valuables from the country in question. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure this is a bad thing however - Mali could very well choose to ask for military intervention from france in exchange for some prospecting contracts and claims. Ridding the country of islamic extremists is no small feat, and perhaps that should come at a price in the long run. <br /><br />The situation isn&#039;t unique to mali/france however. Many european countries see their former colonies overrun by islamic terrorist forces, and this will result in claims for military assistance. Since these former colonies decided on being independent in the past, i suppose its not unfair that they now offer something in exchange for assistance by western firepower. Those fighter jets don&#039;t run on shells and mirrors, after all.

				So, by your reasoning, every type of oppression is cool except if it&#039;s Muslim right? Islamic terrorist forces my ass; the only people who will ask for military intervention are ones seeking power in Mali and will sell their country and their soul to foreign powers to do so.

				There will always be conflicts of interest. Virtually all countries that have been colonized in the past rely on companies from the former occupying country to exploit their natural resources.<br /><br />In a case like Mali the legitimate government simply requested military assistance, and that request was granted. This assistance came too late to preserve historical sights like those a timbuktu, but they prove to be effective otherwise. <br /><br />As far as comparing previous colonization with current islamitic movements: I suppose the former colonists weren&#039;t actually -that- bad. Surely they took resources from the country by force at some point, but at least they did not really police thought, except for thea crusades of course.
