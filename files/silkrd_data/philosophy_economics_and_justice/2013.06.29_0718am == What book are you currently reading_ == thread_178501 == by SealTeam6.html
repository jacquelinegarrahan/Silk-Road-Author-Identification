				1421: The Year China Discovered the World. <br /><br />Very interesting historical redefinition of a period of time preceding a Chinese Emporer who assumed power as a birthright in 1423. He was xenophobic and worried his culture would be influenced too much by global forces. He destroyed all evidence (except that which was only being revealed in the author&#039;s research as he wrote the book), and it was effectively wiped from history for international eyes, and domestic China as well. Great if you like diplomatic history.

				I&#039;m reading an instruction manuel for a new plasma arc welding machine.<br /><br />And a blueprint for a greenhouse that a fellow worker done for me.<br /><br />Also reading sports in a newspaper and reading the football fixtures to work out when its best to take a holiday and also researching whether the holiday destination has either UK sports channels or some pub has sport on the big screen. <br /><br />The drugs, the destination is A-OK and we pass through Portugal were I know someone from the UK who lives there and therefore gets hold of the good hash!<br /><br />Oh, I got the arc welder going now. So best weld something to show everyone how this differs from normal welders and why we use it in certain jobs.<br /><br />Then its off to diiner and then a joint and a lift home as my car is being fixed after I reversed into one of those annoying thin bollards which never had its light on! <br /><br />And I&#039;m not working nights for a few months.&nbsp; ;D This my good news of the day! I like working nights in the summer but its pretty damp and cold and I&#039;d sooner be at home in a warm bed with the missus. What I wil miss is being able to sleep like a King and be 100% tip top at the weekend as night workers sneak off early on Thursday, get home for midnight, sometimes even home for the pub! Lovely stuff!<br /><br />Now I&#039;ll be up at 7.00am, home at 5-6.00pm, might need a little smoke and a little lie down on the Friday before I go out. <br /><br />I&#039;m also reading what I&#039;ve just written of course!<br /><br />I guess that can be said for everyone.<br /><br />What are you reading right now? Some thread asking me what I am reading! <br /><br />Later you drug taking retrobates!<br /><br />

				Loved that detail above. :P<br /><br /><br />Started on some Ayn Rand. Listened to a discussion of her views on objectivism, and will be launching into Atlas Shrugged this month.
