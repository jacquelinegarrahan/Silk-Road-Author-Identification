				You are very much so welcome.<br /><br />PS I meant to say. A small group rules the rest. <br />And a lot of people expect this. Because they feel that the Russian people and Russia my nature needs one single dictatorial ruler. All tough there where some attempts at democracy in Russia none have lasted very long. And I also think that democracy will never work in Russia. And Russian are very stern and yet hospitable but also sometimes very cruel. It is a country with great extremes. The summers are hot the winter are freezing cold and that reflects in the character of the people. I am of Russian heritage so you considered me a kind of an expert on this.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Anyway, I took this from the Wikipedia article about him because this book is absolutely frightening:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">In 1984, Golitsyn published the book New Lies For Old,[13] wherein he predicted the collapse of the communist bloc orchestrated from above. He warned about a long-term deception strategy designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the United States. Among other things, Golitsyn stated:<br />&quot;The &#039;liberalization&#039; [in the Soviet Union] would be spectacular and impressive. Formal pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party&#039;s role; its monopoly would be apparently curtailed.&quot;<br />&quot;If [liberalization] should be extended to East Germany, demolition of the Berlin Wall might even be contemplated.&quot;<br />&quot;The European Parliament might become an all-European socialist parliament with representation from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. &#039;Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals&#039; would turn out to be a neutral, socialist Europe.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And then there is this little gem:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">In his book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA (Knopf, 1994), Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in New Lies For Old, 139 had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed &#039;clearly wrong&#039;, and the other 46 were &#039;not soon falsifiable&#039;.[15]</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Jundullahi, I&#039;d be interested to see what you think about the things I posted above. Maybe if you want, check out the wikipedia articles on Golitsyn and follow some links around, maybe you&#039;ll see some names you recognize and can give us a better perspective (us being SealTeam6 and myself) a better idea of what&#039;s going on.<br /><br />PS, I absolutely love that show The Americans because it combines all my favorite things..The 1980s, Soviets, Reagan and Keri Russell...what&#039;s not to like?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This looks like a very interesting read!
