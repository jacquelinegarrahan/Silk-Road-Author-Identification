				The weird thing about Europeans is how they came to internalize American ethics and imitate them.<br /><br />The post-war Euros started trying to imitate Americans - while their fathers (like all Europeans before them) looked down on America and Americans.

The way the cluture is represented is totally inaccurate. I will say this though. In america, The way teenagers are etc is very different to the way we are here when we are teens. For a start i cnt believe you can join the armed forces and go to war, But cant even drink alcohol until you are 21, that is plain ridiculous. The way &quot;house partys&quot; are portrayed is crazy, We did all that sort of thing when we were around 14-18 tops. <br />There is literally no emphasis on &quot;school sports&quot; here. College football as well has absolutely no status, especially not celebrity like as in some states. The whole system is set up so differently. You would come here and think it was a ghetto in the majority of lower middle class areas.<br />people leave school at 16 usually and if they stay on its until they are 17 tops, You can get into college from 14 and upwards, and you dont have to have genius status in order to do so. <br /><br />That is just the main representation of culture inaccuracy that i can see. Im sure there is much more depicted so&nbsp; far from the truth. <br />As i said i have a family member who has lived there for not much longer that 20 years, and i have visited a couple of times, Brilliant, it is such a culture change i just like it a lot cant really explain why, probably because it is different.<br />

I could just as easily say to you, Noone watches movies from other countrys in america? No one listens to music from other countrys? <br />also who says that it is an american style democracy? democracy existed in other countries such as britain a while before it existed in america, that is a cold hard fact. what makes political correctness and capitilism american as well? If anything america certainly is not politically correct, actually it is far from it. Your points make not much sense because people listen to music all over the world, it does not matter where they live, it would be hard these days to avoid american music.

I could just as easily say to you, Noone watches movies from other countrys in america? No one listens to music from other countrys? <br />also who says that it is an american style democracy? democracy existed in other countries such as britain a while before it existed in america, that is a cold hard fact. what makes political correctness and capitilism american as well? If anything america certainly is not politically correct, actually it is far from it. Your points make not much sense because people listen to music all over the world, it does not matter where they live, it would be hard these days to avoid american music.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the things I mentioned, taken as a whole (not considered in isolation), are distinctively American. Europeans imitate American cultural, ideological and political forms. I could add many other things to that list.

				Maybe its just because we&#039;re ignorant but no we don&#039;t watch movies from other countries.&nbsp; We listen to musicians from other countries but only after they have come here and have been Americanized.&nbsp; Its not because we are somehow superior but there is absolutely no denying that American pop culture is much more universally recognized than any other country.

				Personally I don&#039;t take any culture/nation as a role to imitate but there are things I like in most. I&#039;m from Europe(Italy, Spain..), but I lived some time in California. <br />Well, I&#039;m pretty much a party guy. Go out at 10PM and come house at 8AM. Or later. That in the US doesn&#039;t seem possible the way I see it, the places close early and the alcohol is pretty expensive. Here is common, my friends and I do that usually.. It&#039;s just that way. There is a lot more party. That was a major point back about US. Here I just go out to some place and start taking beers with my friends till 3AM, and I can do it everyday almost anywhere, It&#039;s a more &quot;go out&quot;. Anyway, this is for Southern Europe that for Europe itself.<br /><br />About the culture itself US can&#039;t fight with the history and development in Europe. It&#039;s a pretty new country and doesn&#039;t have the cultural heredity that Europe does have. Today it may be the major creator, but It&#039;s shit mostly, as there are no artist but capitalist, and that make an art made for the market, and the market is in the center of the Bell Curve. There are exceptions obviously, but the major role of US as a culture creator is Hollywood and pop stars for the layman. Mediocrity at It&#039;s best.<br /><br />About the food.. well, I really didn&#039;t dig into that, but I suppose someone can enlighten us here. I personally don&#039;t see it being superior by any means. Europe It&#039;s just a lot more diverse, different nations, different cultures.. It can&#039;t really even compare. It&#039;s not some kind of mix-up done by immigrants, they&#039;re nations with an history of hundreds and hundreds of years.<br /><br />Politically US have the best and the worst. I don&#039;t like the European socialism and statism but also I don&#039;t like how US is turning. At the foundations I take US &gt;&gt;&gt; Europe, but at the state of the art.. probably Europe. Hate some Europeans laws though.<br /><br />Either way, I like the occidental world the most, and there are a lot more equal aspects than differences. Also, here we are going to make a comercial treatment, and that&#039;s how the European Union(or EEC back then) mostly started. So maybe in a few decades.. bah, in a few decades we are gonna being in some kind of cryptoanarchism. Hope. lol<br /><br />Bye<br />

Not arguing and fighting with each other, but the people joinign together in places such as this, to form a community that says No to corrupt governments that try to dictate our lives and raise you from birth to be predisposed towards certain things by using both psychology and propoganda. <br /><br />I personaly love america, the country itself is brilliant, but i dont idolize it, i see no reason too.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thing with America is that NOT the people but the ´Government´ lack respect for the rest of the world.<br />Even Mr. ´Change´ can´t touch the ones living on oil, weapons and information.<br />We know and got to know some beautiful American people who in no way feel the same as the people leading and representing the country.<br />And the difference with Europe is that these are all separate countries that they want to make a big United States of Europe so they can do the same.<br /><br />So it´s best to say that in America (and almost every country around the world) the people who run it don&#039;t listen to the people who choose them. <br />Elections look nice, but you don&#039;t hear about the countryrunners when they ALL vote for things the people don&#039;t want.<br />So don&#039;t hate on the Americans. <br /><br />All send hate to the ones who made us dislike one another without knowing them.<br /><br />Unity to the world (and not as in one government but the PEOPLE)<br /><br />CloudSurfer(s)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178389.msg1292773#msg1292773">Quote from: joywind on June 30, 2013, 11:07 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178389.msg1292744#msg1292744">Quote from: HeatFireFlame on June 30, 2013, 11:02 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178389.msg1292710#msg1292710">Quote from: joywind on June 30, 2013, 10:51 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=178389.msg1292679#msg1292679">Quote from: HeatFireFlame on June 30, 2013, 10:38 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">well where im from, i can tell you for certain nobody imitates americans.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No one watches Ameriacn movies?

I could just as easily say to you, Noone watches movies from other countrys in america? No one listens to music from other countrys? <br />also who says that it is an american style democracy? democracy existed in other countries such as britain a while before it existed in america, that is a cold hard fact. what makes political correctness and capitilism american as well? If anything america certainly is not politically correct, actually it is far from it. Your points make not much sense because people listen to music all over the world, it does not matter where they live, it would be hard these days to avoid american music.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>the things I mentioned, taken as a whole (not considered in isolation), are distinctively American. Europeans imitate American cultural, ideological and political forms. I could add many other things to that list. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />If Europeans would imitate the cultural, ideological and political forms of America?<br /><br />Then we would all wear feathers, shoot bows and arrows, put back everything we took and respect the rest of the world...<br /><br />But still, we respect all people and we can&#039;t blame the whole country for a handful of assholes.<br /><br />CloudSurfer<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				Have you ever been to Europe? I don&#039;t think you could be more wrong.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think enjoying American entertainment is imitation. But it&#039;s bound to have some influence.The only thing that&#039;s very imitating us is the European Union, and i think that&#039;s just the politicians. It&#039;s cute watching them try. Really it&#039;s the only thing that they should be copying us on. But it&#039;s a biggie.

				I never claimed the idea came from the US. In fact i was going to mention to the thread starter how many of the things he claims are American originated in Europe and how he needs a history lesson but i didn&#039;t want to be that guy.
