				Hello All,<br /><br />I&#039;d be very interested to see if some of my fellow and esteemed SR friends could convince me to take back up the banner of Libertarianism again.&nbsp; <br /><br />As my subject suggests, I used to be a Libertarian.&nbsp; However, I slowly came to the conclusion that it just won&#039;t work.&nbsp; I&#039;ve now concluded that Libertariansim is a lot like Communism, they both look pretty good on paper, but neither adequately incorporates certain realities of human nature.&nbsp; In fact, they both have the same basic failing, they assume too much uniformity in the human condition, and are too optimistic about that condition.<br /><br />In Communism, the problem is that it assumes no one really has a desire to have &quot;more&quot; than someone else.&nbsp; It assumes that the most capable will be happy to get the same share as the least capable.&nbsp; Share and share alike.&nbsp; Ridiculous.&nbsp; Brain surgeons want Bentleys, not Yugos.&nbsp; <br /><br />Libertarianism assumes everyone is ready and willing to compete and work hard, and that everyone has something special to bring to market, if only given the chance.&nbsp; Ridiculous as well.&nbsp; Here&#039;s why.<br /><br />The world is filled with four kind of people in my estimation:<br /><br />1) Those whom cannot &quot;do&quot;<br />2) Those whom can &quot;do&quot; a little but are not very motivated to do so.&nbsp; <br />3) Those whom can &quot;do&quot; a little and are motivated to do so.&nbsp; <br />4) Those whom can &quot;do&quot; a lot, and are super motivated.<br /><br />In the perfect Libertarian society, those whom inhabit type 3 &amp; 4 would represent a middle and upper class (modestly well off, and rich respectively).&nbsp; The 1s and 2s would all be poor, and with no governemnt hand-outs would live in squalor unless the 3s &amp; 4s, out of the kindness of their hearts supported them (which is not going to happen, lets face it...we pity the poor...we don&#039;t actually like them).<br /><br />The problem here is that the 1s &amp; 2s...outnumber the 3s and 4s..by quite a large margin in my estimation.&nbsp; Incapable and unmotivated though they may be...they all want to live and feel dignified...and they can all fire a gun.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the long term, this would lead to violence, and a displacement of the Libertarian system.<br /><br />Thus I&#039;ve concluded that the best system is pretty much like the one we have here in the US (and in many other Western contries).&nbsp; There is a safety net, designed to keep the 1s &amp; 2s safe from falling too far into poverty...and keeping the 3s and 4s safe from angry and violent mobs.&nbsp; It&#039;s more like a firewall than a safety net.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only question is...at what level the safety net must be placed...and this will constantly need to be adjusted (based on the economic and social conditions), which our&nbsp; republic is at least dimly able to do over time.&nbsp; It also allows the 3s and 4s to accumulate some wealth, and out of necessity forcibly extracts some of it from them for the safety net (taxes).<br /><br />It is of course, not an optimal system, but the problem is...that people are not perfect...and thus our system must reflect this reality.<br /><br />If you think differntly, then please share where has my reasoning failed me?&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><br />

				My 2 cents on why Libertarianism &amp; Anarchism can&#039;t work is that both of these theories assume all people are responsible and mature persons. But if you have any experience in dealing with people, you cannot possibly come to that conclusion. Some people just need parents to make sure they won&#039;t do anything stupid. That&#039;s why we unfortunately need a government. I&#039;d love Libertarianism if everyone acted like a responsible person.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I agree Chil, it&#039;s an unfortunate truth that many people just don&#039;t have it goin&#039; on.&nbsp; <br /><br />I worked the polls for the Libertarian party one year, and this was the beginning of the end for me.&nbsp; I was absolutely blown away by the ignorance (willfull, or not) of the vast majority of the voters.&nbsp; I desperately tried to engage people in thoughtful discussion, but was dismayed that most people didn&#039;t know what the Bill of Rights was, nor how many branches of government we have, nor even how many states there were.&nbsp; <br /><br />They didn&#039;t even really know why they were voting the way they did...most just came for the free donuts.&nbsp; They all however voted that day.&nbsp; <br /><br />It was quite enlightening.&nbsp; It gave me a new appreciation of our system (flawed though it is).<br /><br />

				Hey Reason, what are your thoughts on a stateless society? Any speculation on why it may or may not work? <br /><br />The problem I see with the current social model is that it uses aggression to achieve results, i.e. taxation, throwing people in jail for having vegetation on their person. What don&#039;t have to be perfect to realize that&#039;s just plain BS. I don&#039;t think that we solve the problem of injustice and an imbalance of merely economic power by creating a monolithic leviathan state with the ability to start up its own laws, initiate force at will, print up its own money and to imprison at a whim.

And the good people of Washington DC get to pay taxes and don&#039;t get a presidential vote so anyone paying taxes in DC is fucking stupid too. You are taxed without ANY representation AT ALL and don&#039;t even get to participate in the FAKE ELECTIONS held every 4 years. Wake up people..... Voting for the president is like picking out a new pope. You have nothing to do with it and it is nothing more than a show for the people.

				What about Ayn Rand&#039;s vision of a capitalist society? It is almost libertarian but I feel it addresses the shortcomings of base-libertarianism.

				What exactly are the 3&#039;s and 4&#039;s doing for society that makes them super motivated? Seems like A LOT(by no means all, the advances our species has made are astounding) of them are stealing money, and not actually making many contributions. They&#039;re motivated by &quot;more&quot;&nbsp; with no real goal in mind. I suppose that you&#039;re right about some people just not ever being able to be with it. Although a lot of those greedy fucks are miserable. I&#039;d rather be a poor farmer that is able to be happy his whole life then a miserable rich banker that has 45 houses. (the farmer may not be remembered but the banker will be remembered as greedy) Far enough down the timeline they&#039;ll both be forgotten. <br /><br />I don&#039;t exactly think exploitation of our own species is the way forward, it&#039;s like we(some) think we&#039;re invincible and the earth is an endless mine to make profit off of. Our stupidity could easily be the end of us. Sometimes we mistake stupidity for intelligence...<br /><br />Although just looking at the education system in America should tell you a lot. I&#039;m not sure about other countries but i&#039;m sure they aren&#039;t much better off. You can graduate high school without taking Algebra in some places... Look at the history that is taught, it&#039;s all watered down and then spoon fed.( of course His-story,&nbsp; will never be 100% but i mean really?) To do any actual learning you need to do it yourself. Most of the teachers are as boring and unethusiastic as the rest of the people. If you aren&#039;t already knowledgeable why the fuck would you be motivated to try and become more intelligent? Society classifies you from the beginning and makes you feel like shit if you aren&#039;t smart enough. Things like art and music aren&#039;t taken seriously. The world is this dark terrible place that you need to find your place in, and make a living the way the 3&#039;s and 4&#039;s say is ok. That&#039;s my opinion anyway.<br /><br />Call me crazy but i have hope for the future, maybe it&#039;s too many drugs who the fuck knows.&nbsp; But seriously why the fuck aren&#039;t we in space? Nasa really only gets half a penny from our tax dollars? (might be a penny, ask my nigga neal) How much does the drug war get? I don&#039;t know how you can say this is the best system we have without laughing.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you need to classify your belief system, just believe what you think or feel is right. Why limit yourself to others view points? As far as people not being perfect you&#039;re right, so why would a system we created over a century ago be the best thing for us today? I think the most important changes need to be in education first, sure i&#039;d love an irrational utopian society as much as the next guy, but i don&#039;t think humans will be capable of that for a long time. One mans utopia is another mans dystopia. That doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t create a system that is pretty fucking good though, and a hell of a lot better than the current one in place.<br /><br />Why is buying fresh organic food harder than buying GMO&#039;s and other processed foods? And why are there so many government laws that go against small farmers? We really can&#039;t grow our own godamn food now?Since when do these psychos think they own the earth? It&#039;s almost laughable, then you realize it&#039;s the real situation. Fuck this society, it&#039;s collapse is inevitable.<br /><br />I know there&#039;s a bunch of grammatical errors and non linear thoughts there, but it&#039;s certainly some stuff to think about i guess.<br /><br />Some more food for thought, the majority of scientists think liberally minded. One of the most respected scientists, carl sagan thought this way. Just read cosmos. :) And listen to neal degrass tyson, very smart man.

So those people can be taken care of via other means. <br /><br />3) People wouldn&#039;t need a safety-net, because you wouldn&#039;t be reliant on businesses to hire you. You could sell drugs, you could start up a service (be it car repair or whatever you want) If you are working for someone else and you get downsized or w/e you take what you learned from that business and start a competing business or a start up. If people aren&#039;t willing to do that, then they have to deal with that choice, why is my responsibility to make people happy or not poor? <br /><br />I don&#039;t have all the answers or a solution for every problem, but I know hundreds, if not thousands of people whom have really good ideas, but can&#039;t do it because it takes so much money to even start a business. Get rid of the regulatory system and you will see business boom and unemployment drop to nearly zero. Will there be tragedy of the commons issues? absolutely, but just like anything else, people have a way to fix those issues. The market will find the bad businesses and destroy them then good business will thrive! There would be no LLC, no CORP protection. no government to protect big business interest, lobbying would die and businesses would thrive. <br /><br />I&#039;d rather go through growing pangs in a free market than the system we have now.

				The real issue is to deal with people who fall into #2, which would leave 3/4ths of the society that you&#039;ve modeled in tact and functional--assuming #1 is no greater than ~1-8% of the population.<br /><br />People of #2 are the reason why the rest suffer. In any economy that you structure, those people would be the ones you&#039;d have to work around the most.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also, you make one err: assuming that &quot;hard work&quot; equals more money. This has shown not the be the case, albeit somewhat indirectly.<br />1) Assume we live in an industrial nation (we do)<br />2) Assume said industrialization has moved labor from being physically-oriented to mental (it has)<br />3) Assume there are stratifications of &quot;hard work,&quot; each coinciding by the level of difficulty of the mental task.<br />4) Thus the more challenging jobs are the ones that require the highest amount of thought.<br /><br />There are Engineers making the next product, who will be outearned by a CEO who studied buisness and had a few connects. Clearly hard work does not always equate.<br /><br />Honestly, although I enjoyed your post, it&#039;s very black/white, which is inherently the problem with non-dynamic government systems.

Seems like A LOT(by no means all, the advances our species has made are astounding) of them are stealing money, and not actually making many contributions. They&#039;re motivated by &quot;more&quot;&nbsp; with no real goal in mind. I suppose that you&#039;re right about some people just not ever being able to be with it. Although a lot of those greedy fucks are miserable. I&#039;d rather be a poor farmer that is able to be happy his whole life then a miserable rich banker that has 45 houses. (the farmer may not be remembered but the banker will be remembered as greedy) Far enough down the timeline they&#039;ll both be forgotten. <br /><br />I don&#039;t exactly think exploitation of our own species is the way forward, it&#039;s like we(some) think we&#039;re invincible and the earth is an endless mine to make profit off of. Our stupidity could easily be the end of us. Sometimes we mistake stupidity for intelligence...<br /><br />Although just looking at the education system in America should tell you a lot. I&#039;m not sure about other countries but i&#039;m sure they aren&#039;t much better off. You can graduate high school without taking Algebra in some places... Look at the history that is taught, it&#039;s all watered down and then spoon fed.( of course His-story,&nbsp; will never be 100% but i mean really?) To do any actual learning you need to do it yourself. Most of the teachers are as boring and unethusiastic as the rest of the people. If you aren&#039;t already knowledgeable why the fuck would you be motivated to try and become more intelligent? Society classifies you from the beginning and makes you feel like shit if you aren&#039;t smart enough. Things like art and music aren&#039;t taken seriously. The world is this dark terrible place that you need to find your place in, and make a living the way the 3&#039;s and 4&#039;s say is ok. That&#039;s my opinion anyway.<br /><br />Call me crazy but i have hope for the future, maybe it&#039;s too many drugs who the fuck knows.&nbsp; But seriously why the fuck aren&#039;t we in space? Nasa really only gets half a penny from our tax dollars? (might be a penny, ask my nigga neal) How much does the drug war get? I don&#039;t know how you can say this is the best system we have without laughing.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think you need to classify your belief system, just believe what you think or feel is right. Why limit yourself to others view points? As far as people not being perfect you&#039;re right, so why would a system we created over a century ago be the best thing for us today? I think the most important changes need to be in education first, sure i&#039;d love an irrational utopian society as much as the next guy, but i don&#039;t think humans will be capable of that for a long time. One mans utopia is another mans dystopia. That doesn&#039;t mean we can&#039;t create a system that is pretty fucking good though, and a hell of a lot better than the current one in place.<br /><br />Why is buying fresh organic food harder than buying GMO&#039;s and other processed foods? And why are there so many government laws that go against small farmers? We really can&#039;t grow our own godamn food now?Since when do these psychos think they own the earth? It&#039;s almost laughable, then you realize it&#039;s the real situation. Fuck this society, it&#039;s collapse is inevitable.<br /><br />I know there&#039;s a bunch of grammatical errors and non linear thoughts there, but it&#039;s certainly some stuff to think about i guess.<br /><br />Some more food for thought, the majority of scientists think liberally minded. One of the most respected scientists, carl sagan thought this way. Just read cosmos. :) And listen to neal degrass tyson, very smart man.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ah the voice of a human with the heart of an artist in moral outrage.&nbsp; Always wonderful to hear!&nbsp; This is the voice of our collective conscience, reminding us of our responsibilities to the planet and each other.&nbsp; Give &#039;em hell friend!<br /><br />You make many good points here.&nbsp; The bottom line is I agree with you largely.&nbsp; Our system must make room for the intellecual free thinker and yes the classic starving artist.&nbsp; <br /><br />These folks are in 2 category.&nbsp; They have the ability to be very productive in a market economy, but are unmotivated to do so.&nbsp; Please don&#039;t mistake my saying this as passing judgement, rather I suggest that people of this ilk are making a moral and informed decision not to participate, and many of these people enrich our culture if not our wallets.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thus again...the safety net has purpose here, we must be willing to support these type of people.&nbsp; Lest their creative genious be turned toward ill ends.&nbsp; I&#039;ve known people whom were artists, and parents, and they railed against &quot;the system&quot;, but when they had a baby, well...they needed medical support and feasted on government cheese.&nbsp; I loved their art and I loved them. <br /><br />You also point out that the system allows devious an those with ill intent to rob and plunder.&nbsp; Indeed, this is true, and is a short coming.&nbsp; However, it is IMO, a necessary evil.&nbsp; The accumulation of wealth (illicit or otherwise) is necessary for the overall exercise.&nbsp; The ones and twos will be able to be fed and clothed from the treasure the government forcibly extracts from these folks.<br /><br />BTW:&nbsp; Another important point in my worldview is that we must have a system that allows the advance of science.&nbsp; Our world is doomed, and&nbsp; this is just a fact.&nbsp; Perhaps we will do it (global warming, nucluear war, biological disaster), or perhaps it will be natural (massive commet, gamma ray burst, super-volcano, coronal mass ejection).&nbsp; Which means that we must get the hell off this planet and begin colonizing other worlds, and as soon as possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree whole heartedly with Carl Sagan&#039;s characterization of humanity, we are the universe &quot;woken up&quot; and just beginning to regard itself.&nbsp; Humanity is therefore precious.&nbsp; We must not let ourselves be extinguised.&nbsp; We&#039;re very groovy.&nbsp; :-)

				Absolutely love this thread.<br /><br />The fact is, the ideas brought forward as ideal &quot;libertarianism&quot; today are incredibly naive, simplistic and in many ways as deluded as religions in that they all &quot;believe&quot; in this invisible, intangible, unprovable &quot;force&quot; that will make everything right for everyone - namely, Adam Smith&#039;s invisible hand.<br /><br />Libertarians today subscribe to this simpleton logic that &quot;Ponderosa Ranch sells bad steaks, people will stop buying steaks from Ponderosa Ranch&quot; as cure-it-all for any and all market failures. Obviously, this idea falls flat on it&#039;s nose as soon as the Ponderosa Ranch has enough liquid assets to spend on making sure their &quot;bad steaks&quot; aren&#039;t being exposed to the public, to hire &quot;crisis managers&quot; and &quot;social media monitors&quot; to mitigate the impact of &quot;bad publicity&quot;. OP&#039;s observation that what people think would be working libertarianism is just as poppycock as communism is one of the sharpest observations and parallels I&#039;ve seen on here in a while.... big +1.<br /><br />I have for a very long time felt that those favoring extreme libertarianism in societies with extreme labor division simply lack the perspective to understand just how many &quot;victims&quot; their preferred form of market Darwinism would produce, and worse, how severe these failings would impact the affected. <br /><br />Your life savings gone because some financial sheister screwed you? Your fault, you should have informed yourself better. <br /><br />But please do tell how is a carpenter, electrician, HVAC maintenance guy etc. to inform himself in a subject matter so complex that even those within the industry don&#039;t understand the complexity of the instruments they trade. 2007 crash anyone?<br /><br />Adam Smith is by and large considered the &quot;father&quot; of capitalism, and Wealth of Nations - particularly division of labor - is one of the most quoted works on capitalism still today. However, a lot of those purporting to be &quot;libertarian&quot; today will usually quote from the first half of the book, presumably because they don&#039;t like that even Adam Smith, father of capitalism himself, stipulated that the division of labor will reach a point where an external force (government, regulation) will be needed to maintain a healthy balance of interests.<br /><br />Anyways, short on time just now but I&#039;ll sure be back for more....

So those people can be taken care of via other means. <br /><br />3) People wouldn&#039;t need a safety-net, because you wouldn&#039;t be reliant on businesses to hire you. You could sell drugs, you could start up a service (be it car repair or whatever you want) If you are working for someone else and you get downsized or w/e you take what you learned from that business and start a competing business or a start up. If people aren&#039;t willing to do that, then they have to deal with that choice, why is my responsibility to make people happy or not poor? <br /><br />I don&#039;t have all the answers or a solution for every problem, but I know hundreds, if not thousands of people whom have really good ideas, but can&#039;t do it because it takes so much money to even start a business. Get rid of the regulatory system and you will see business boom and unemployment drop to nearly zero. Will there be tragedy of the commons issues? absolutely, but just like anything else, people have a way to fix those issues. The market will find the bad businesses and destroy them then good business will thrive! There would be no LLC, no CORP protection. no government to protect big business interest, lobbying would die and businesses would thrive. <br /><br />I&#039;d rather go through growing pangs in a free market than the system we have now.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Interesting points, responded to in order:<br /><br />1) Because otherwise they may organize themselves into a violent mob and take it from you (destroying all in their path on the way).&nbsp; The French revolution is a cautionary tale here.&nbsp; Also, we do have a moral imperative to care for those in our society whom are unable (and yes unwilling) to care for themselves.&nbsp; We are human beings, and reciprocal altruism is at the heart of how our minds evolved to work.&nbsp; We also therefore expect that should we fall, our neighbors will not sit idly by, they would carry us.&nbsp; Thus we are willing to carry others.<br /><br />2) Yes there are always freeloaders, and they should not be coddled.&nbsp; It should not be easy or sexy to get government cheese.&nbsp; It must be however possible.<br /><br />3) If only this were true.&nbsp; However even in a world of totally unfettered capatalism, there are many whom simply could not comete (again either willfully or not).&nbsp; Keep in mind, half of everyone is below average intelligence, and even those at the half point up...may not be willing to do so (for whatever reason).&nbsp; Dismissing thier needs would be dangerous, and morally questionable.&nbsp; Government is the means by which we as a community implement our decision to care for these people.<br /><br />I also know a lot of people with good ideas, grand dreams and aspirations.&nbsp; I have them too.&nbsp; However, I soon forget about them and end up riding my bike or watching TV.&nbsp; This puts me solidly in the 3 category, I work, but not too hard, and I&#039;d be a terrible business person (I&#039;m just not that motivated by money).&nbsp; It&#039;s those 4s that are the engines of business...and if your friends were 4s..they cut through that red tape and make it happen (others have, and what one man can do another can do...given the drive and intelligence).

				This is directly from aynrandlexicon.org, the book Atlas Shrugged is great but it is a slow start, once it gets going momentum wise it is actually quite good:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">At a sales conference at Random House, preceding the publication of Atlas Shrugged, one of the book salesmen asked me whether I could present the essence of my philosophy while standing on one foot. I did as follows:<br /><br />Metaphysics: Objective Reality<br />Epistemology: Reason<br />Ethics: Self-interest<br />Politics: Capitalism<br />If you want this translated into simple language, it would read: 1. “Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed” or “Wishing won’t make it so.” 2. “You can’t eat your cake and have it, too.” 3. “Man is an end in himself.” 4. “Give me liberty or give me death.”<br /><br />If you held these concepts with total consistency, as the base of your convictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course of your life. But to hold them with total consistency—to understand, to define, to prove and to apply them—requires volumes of thought. Which is why philosophy cannot be discussed while standing on one foot—nor while standing on two feet on both sides of every fence. This last is the predominant philosophical position today, particularly in the field of politics.<br /><br />My philosophy, Objectivism, holds that:<br /><br />Reality exists as an objective absolute—facts are facts, independent of man’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears.<br /><br />Reason (the faculty which identifies and integrates the material provided by man’s senses) is man’s only means of perceiving reality, his only source of knowledge, his only guide to action, and his basic means of survival.<br /><br />Man—every man—is an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others. He must exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself. The pursuit of his own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life.<br /><br />The ideal political-economic system is laissez-faire capitalism. It is a system where men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. It is a system where no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force, and no man may initiate the use of physical force against others. The government acts only as a policeman that protects man’s rights; it uses physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use, such as criminals or foreign invaders. In a system of full capitalism, there should be (but, historically, has not yet been) a complete separation of state and economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				From the Money Speech:<br /><br />&quot;Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion–when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing–when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors–when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don’t protect you against them, but protect them against you–when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice–you may know that your society is doomed.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s really amazing how spot on she was about the future. Society here IS doomed. Capitalism in America and most of Europe is already dead. We just don&#039;t know it yet.<br /><br />Keep on slinging mud and rocks at Rand! Doesn&#039;t make her any less truthful or right.<br /><br />Child murderer? Really??? Was she the first member of Al Qaeda too?&nbsp; ;D ::)

So the workers are being paid less but required to buy as much and even encouraged to buy more, Credit is great for this.

				Ann Rand<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">William Edward Hickman stated in 1928, &quot;I am like the state: what is good for me is right.&quot; Rand wrote in her journal regarding his statement &quot;The best and strongest expression of a real man&#039;s psychology I have heard.&quot; Hickman made quite an impression on Rand, because she deliberately modeled Danny Renahan, the hero of a planned novel titled The Little Street, on Hickman, according to Rand scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra. Rand also wrote regarding Renahan, &quot;Other people do not exist for him and he does not understand why they should.&quot;<br /><br />By now you might assume that Hickman was a great philosopher or something like that. The Malefactor&#039;s Register and Fate, Death and The Fox documented the grisly reality.<br /><br />In Los Angeles on 12/15/1927, the 19-year-old Hickman told the 12-year-old Marion Parker&#039;s school principal that her father had become seriously ill. The principal allowed Hickman to take her even though he had asked for “the younger daughter,” clearly ignorant of the fact that she was a twin. Hickman sent a letter to her father demanding money, a price was agreed upon, and a rendezvous was set. Her father gave $1500 to Hickman who was waiting for him in a Ford roadster. Her father saw his daughter in a package showing only her head on the passenger seat next to Hickman; her father assumed she had been chloroformed. After Hickman received the money, he drove down the block with Marion still in the car. Hickman stopped, pushed her out of the car, and drove away. Her father ran to her and only then realized that the package only contained her head and torso. Hickman had cut off her arms and legs and removed her internal organs and replaced them with rags. Her back showed signs of flogging. Marion’s arms and legs were later found in a park, wrapped in newspaper.<br /><br />This was Rand&#039;s &quot;real man,&quot; someone who kidnapped a 12-year-old girl, almost certainly raped her, and butchered her like a farm animal. One can only hope he killed her before butchering her, but one report stated that he believed she was alive when he began to dismember her.<br /><br />Rand expressed contempt for those who disliked her heroic killer: &quot;The first thing that impresses me about the case is the ferocious rage of a whole society against one man. No matter what the man did, there is always something loathsome in the &#039;virtuous&#039; indignation and mass-hatred of the &#039;majority&#039; . . . It is repulsive to see all these beings with worse sins and crimes in their own lives, virtuously condemning a criminal.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Source of the article, clearweb, includes other clearweb links giving citations of various facts: <br />http://saucymugwump.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/alan-greenspan-ayn-rand-and-child.html<br /><br />Another one:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The mutilations Hickman inflicted on little Marian were worse than reported in the excerpt above. He cut the girl’s body in half, and severed her hands (or arms, depending on the source). He drained her torso of blood and stuffed it with bath towels.<br /><br />…<br /><br />In her notes, Rand complains that poor Hickman has become the target of irrational and ugly mob psychology:<br /><br />“The first thing that impresses me about the case is the ferocious rage of a whole society against one man. No matter what the man did, there is always something loathsome in the ‘virtuous’ indignation and mass-hatred of the ‘majority.’… It is repulsive to see all these beings with worse sins and crimes in their own lives, virtuously condemning a criminal…<br /><br />“This is not just the case of a terrible crime. It is not the crime alone that has raised the fury of public hatred. It is the case of a daring challenge to society. It is the fact that a crime has been committed by one man, alone; that this man knew it was against all laws of humanity and intended that way; that he does not want to recognize it as a crime and that he feels superior to all. It is the amazing picture of a man with no regard whatever for all that society holds sacred, and with a consciousness all his own. A man who really stands alone, in action and in soul.”</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />CLEARLINK WARNING #2, https://francoistremblay.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/ayn-rands-love-of-a-serial-killer/<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of rape-fiction author Ann Rand (ever try reading her sex scenes?) is someone you do not want to babysit any of your children.<br />

Her ideal person is simply one who is productive and makes no sacrifices (her definition of sacrifice probably differs than what most people have in mind). She was not against helping people, she was against helping someone out of a sense of duty or because &quot;you had to&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Understanding Atlas Shrugged properly you would see that being &quot;wealthy&quot; was not necessary to fit that ideal persona, many of the railroad workers during the crisis were shown as great individuals, albeit without wealth.<br /><br />She would not have condoned the behavior of the banksters having to do with the economical crash. The banksters behaved in much the same way the government subsidized organization in Atlas Shrugged behaved. Being wealthy as a result of sucking the government&#039;s dick is not something Rand would have looked highly upon. Furthermore, her definition of force was not limited to physical force. For example, in the states we pay taxes because we are forced; the IRS isn&#039;t going to beat the shit out of you for not paying but depending on the amount, you could end up in prison (that is the force). The bankers here were in bed with the gov&#039;t and were using the monopoly on force that the government currently holds.<br /><br />Rand was also only opposed to government actions where force is used. This would cover all forms of welfare and any other government institutions that are funded through &quot;forced&quot; taxation. She did recognize the need for government for the protection of individual rights (aka courts, police, military, etc). In a government where its only function is to protect individual rights a voluntary tax system would likely be successful (I know I would pay a good 10-20% of my income for my own protection). <br /><br />Lastly, she did make some mistakes in her personal life, no matter what mistakes she made, those decisions are independent of the philosophy and ideals she developed. I say, &quot;murder is bad&quot; if I go and kill someone, it does not make my original statement of &quot;murder is bad&quot; less valid, it just makes me a hypocrite at worst; the same can be applied to her.<br /><br />P.S She did apply and receive gov&#039;t benefits in her life, why? because under objectivist ethics it is proper to reclaim taxes you were forced to pay during your working life in the form of benefits. If at any point the welfare you receive exceeds what you&#039;ve been forced to pay, then it become unethical.<br /><br />-xoxo

However, and at a tangent, him as a universal messiah is discredited by his own Sermon on the Mount, the reference to &quot;pearls before swine, unholy before dogs&quot; is not, as Christian apologist reinterpret, Jesus telling his flock to not preach to the unconverted. Both dogs and swine are Talmudic clichés for gentiles (the unclean). Literally Jesus was telling his flock not to preach the world of the Jewish god to non-Jews. The idea of Jesus as a messiah for non-Jews is something Jesus never contemplated - it was something Paul got into for there was lots of money in Greece. <br />

				I guess you missed the blatant fact that the revolving door between the banks and government is the largest open collaboration between business and government there is.<br /><br />Maybe you just aren&#039;t aware that the current head of Goldman Sachs was secretly negotiating with the former head of Goldman Sachs for who would survive and who wouldn&#039;t after the financial crisis was over. That former head of Goldman Sachs was the Secretary of the Treasury. Another former head of Goldman Sachs was Jon Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey. Lookup MF Global sometime.

				You&#039;re a funny guy!&nbsp; ;D ::)<br /><br />Let me TRY to make it simple for you: a lot of money was plowed into housing from 2000 until about 2007. A LOT of money. Trillions of dollars. Government and the Federal Reserve ENCOURAGED it. In order to sell the mortgages on those properties- behavior that is 100% encouraged by the Treasury-backed government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie)- the use of derivatives was again ENCOURAGED. The government through these GSEs was the biggest backer of mortgage-backed securities. They gave the investment banks a huge amount of business during the housing bubble.<br /><br />Other kinds of derivatives were created to get through loopholes especially crafted by the bankers best friends in government. The two types of derivatives which directly caused the crisis were called Credit Default Swaps and Collateralized Debt Obligations. Banks and other institutions wrote CDS &quot;insurance&quot; on CDO derivatives which were really just a basket of 3 different &quot;slices&quot; of mortgages. When housing prices took a big hit, the CDOs took a much bigger hit. That&#039;s when the CDS insurance was supposed to kick in. Too bad they were backed by little or nothing. Anyone (every financial institution out there) holding a CDS received no insurance at all. Anyone who wrote a CDS contract (every financial institution out there) was on the hook for tens of billions of dollars that were lost on the CDOs.<br /><br />Who was the first casualty of all this? Fannie Mae. The government decided to start a crisis specifically designed to put more power in the hands of fewer commercial and investment banks. Goldman Sachs #1. Treasury bailed Fannie out for 90 cents on the dollar- not completely so that it would set off a run on all the CDS insurance on Fannie&#039;s paper. That&#039;s exactly what happened and Goldman&#039;s biggest competitor Lehman was gone in a week. The rest of the crisis followed and didn&#039;t end for another 6 months.<br /><br />The problem is not not NOT (!!!!!) the lack of regulation. It never was. The problem is SELECTIVE regulation drafted and enforced under a gang of fascists and armed thugs. If you&#039;re part of the government&#039;s revolving door, special boy&#039;s club you&#039;re fine. If you&#039;re not then you&#039;re fucking dead meat if they want you to be. It&#039;s just that simple.<br /><br />Asking the government to solve this problem or pretty much any other is like asking Richard Ramirez for a haircut.<br /><br />I probably made a big mistake by even posting this.... Hopefully not.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206731.msg1493841#msg1493841">Quote from: Rocknessie on August 27, 2013, 12:47 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Not even that, the sub-prime thing has been disproven as causal to the crash.

				In a more layman style of argument. Notice the banks that didn&#039;t need bailing out....to my knowledge they are also the banks that are least involved with the gov&#039;t. What happened there was similar to Atlas Shrugged and the businesses that survived only because of favorable regulation, business that would have otherwise died on merit alone. <br /><br />Like Baraka said, instead of attacking the person it would be nice for you to address specific theories/arguments that she made. aynrandlexicon.org (clearnet) is a good place where you can find her stuff in an organized fashion.

Instead, agorists stress the importance of alternative strategies rather than politics to achieve a free society. Agorists claim that we can achieve a free society more easily and sooner by employing such alternative methods as education, direct action, alternative currencies, entrepreneurship, self sufficiency, and most importantly &quot;counter-economics&quot;.[1] Agorists consider their message to be scientific because science is an appeal to reason, which they believe is only possible in the Agora or free market. Agorists believe that State backed, regulated and funded science is illegitimate.[3]&quot;<br /><br />&quot;[anarcho-capitalism] ...is a political philosophy which advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty in a free market.[4][5] In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and all other security services would be provided by privately funded competitors rather than through taxation, and money would be privately and competitively provided in an open market. Therefore, personal and economic activities under anarcho-capitalism would be regulated by privately run law rather than through politics.&quot;<br /><br />I guess the fact that I use SR, would suggest that at least I&#039;m not wholly opposed to many of the ideas in Agorism (if we agree that counter-economics is the study and practice of engaging in the market of things forbidden by the government).&nbsp; Still, there are some things that are forbidden, that I&#039;d not be interested in studying or in practicing (weird pedo porn, or nuclear weapons for example).&nbsp; I also would have to say that a great deal of basic science would not be pursued if not supported by the government (as there is very little profit in basic science, although basic science is needed to make the breakthroughs which eventually turn into goods and services).&nbsp; Therefore I consider basic science what Adam Smith called an externality to the market, and an appropriate area of government involvement.<br /><br />&nbsp;As for the anarcho-capitalism, well...it sort of sounds like mob rule (with various private police forces being paid to enforce someone&#039;s version of the law for profit).&nbsp; I think this is probably how some of the old fiefdoms ran, as there were armies which could be rented for various engagements by various govenors or dukes.&nbsp; Sounds kinda scary in truth.

				Derailed thread derails fast.<br /><br />Back to why Ayn Rand&#039;s pseudo-philosophy is poppycock. Ayn Rand categorically detested all forms of altruism. And therein lies the crux. At the current stage of scientific knowledge and commonly accepted theories in many different disciplines we are hardwired to be altruistic, some more some less.<br /><br />For example, a number of neurobiology studies have found that altruistic behavior lights up the mesolimbic system (for the junkies in here, yep, that&#039;s the same part that makes coke feel so nice), thus, altruism is not a &quot;failed social construct&quot; as objectivists would stipulate, but in fact an evolutionary trait. Matter of fact, some biologists make a strong case that altruism is at the base of evolutionary reciprocity, which would in turn mean that without biologically hardwired altruism our species wouldn&#039;t worry about John Galt making money but rather about finding the next ant mound to lick some critters off a stick like our ape cousins.<br /><br />In Rand&#039;s opinion altruism is a case of &quot;failed&quot; identity, identity being her warped perception of this conflated sum of self-interest actions and &quot;rational&quot; conclusions.<br /><br />What I am saying is, her &quot;philosophy&quot; is completely and utterly debunked in that she misunderstands biologically hardwired evolutionary functions of our species as &quot;identity-less whim-worship&quot;.<br /><br />Way I see it, the woman was tremendously butthurt by communism in her own country, so she started writing these coked/amph&#039;ed up &quot;philosophy&quot; pamphlets that really aren&#039;t much more than stipulations of the direct opposite of communism, which is of course a far cry from being an actual &quot;philosophy&quot; even remotely able to survive Hume&#039;s Guillotine.

				Agreed.<br /><br />Saw a great documentary on Game Theory. The presenter talked to the creator of Game Theory (the theory that all humans act aggressively - in naked self interest - towards all other humans all the time, creating equilibrium) and asked &quot;what about altruism&quot;.<br /><br />He paused for about a third of a second, grinned, and replied &quot;I have no idea how to model that&quot;.<br /><br />Which is a shame given how influential his ghastly ideas have been.

				All good points. I said from first time I mentioned Rand earlier in this thread that her thoughts on money, business and self interest are untouchable. That Atlas Shrugged was a prophecy that has come true. When she starts talking about altruism things start getting messy. And messier still when talking about Objectivism. That&#039;s something I definitely don&#039;t subscribe to and I&#039;m no atheist either which any real Objectivist MUST be. The worst were her views on Israel and the current views of the Ayn Rand Institute on Israel and its enemies. They&#039;re all out batshit crazy on that stuff.<br /><br />Guess I should&#039;ve said that I&#039;m no worshipper of Rand-- except when it comes to business. Then again I wouldn&#039;t have had the fun of reading the responses of how my she&#039;s my &quot;hero&quot; and that I&#039;m just a zombie who parrots everything she had to say&nbsp; ;D :P<br /><br />Getting back to altruism, Rand made a lot of good points about how some form of altruism was instrumental to the regimes of Hitler, Stalin and most other mass murderers. What she was really talking about was state-sponsored altruism which is the worst of the worst. Too bad she didn&#039;t stop there. She applied her beliefs to ALL forms of altruism. Although she made a good point about no animal being able to survive if it helped every other animal but itself first, she struggled to make the same distinction with human beings. She also struggled to justify how caring and giving up for another in a relationship somehow WASN&#039;T altruism. She made it seem like it was an type of exchange within the relationship. Really weak reasoning and I&#039;ve never bought it.<br /><br />I don&#039;t blame her though. She witnessed firsthand how people she knew in Russia were slaughtered by Communist thugs like they were pieces of trash. She saw how the government twisted people&#039;s beliefs into buying into the state&#039;s version of altruism (which always involved coercion, force, theft, torture and killing)- all for the &quot;public good&quot; of course. A term Rand uses again and again and again. Altruism is still often used today by both parties to justify giving up money, freedom, privacy and many other rights for the &quot;public good&quot;. You&#039;ll be hearing a lot more about that in the coming days when the next war in the middle east starts.

				All arguments are moot. <br /><br />Theft cannot be justified. No matter the reasoning. You&#039;re all the debating on how the system would work (and a lot of wacky conspiracy shit)<br /><br />But what it really boils down to is that one person should not be able to steal from another. (taxes). Those of you who can&#039;t look after yourselves and want a safety-bracket are more than welcome to join a anarcho-socialist society. Just don&#039;t force me to participate. <br /><br />Once you realise that taxation is theft, and the non-aggression principle (The non-aggression principle (NAP)—also called the non-aggression axiom, the zero aggression principle (ZAP), the anti-coercion principle, or the non-initiation of force—is a moral stance which asserts that aggression is inherently illegitimate. NAP and property rights are closely linked, since what aggression is depends on what a person&#039;s rights are.[1] Aggression, for the purposes of NAP, is defined as the initiation or threatening of violence against a person or legitimately-owned property of another. Specifically, any unsolicited actions of others that physically affect an individual’s property or person, no matter if the result of those actions is damaging, beneficial, or neutral to the owner, are considered violent or aggressive when they are against the owner&#039;s free will and interfere with his right to self-determination and the principle of self-ownership.) is the only correct way for humans to co-exist. The rest will fall into place

				Except taxes are not theft. They are a pool of resource needed for the common good.<br /><br />In the Libertarian world my partner - ill with Multiple Sclerosis - wouldn&#039;t die. No. She&#039;d be on a path of increasing, permanent, disability because I can&#039;t afford to purchase the thousands of pounds worth of medicine she takes each and every month. Basically blind in a wheelchair, with increasing pain. She worked before illness, I worked a well paying job for decades. For years and years each of us put into the system vastly more than either of us ever withdrew. It would have been fine with each of us if neither of us ever saw &quot;value&quot; for that taxation. But as she&#039;s the &quot;lucky&quot; one in a million to come down with a horrific illness it&#039;s nice that social pool of tax money is available.<br /><br />And no, the money alone we put in wouldn&#039;t have been enough to cover all the costs. That&#039;s the point of spreading the cost over a larger user base. The larger the base the lower any individual contribution. Fairness would suggest the richer paid more than the poorer, as I did. Progressive taxation is the pinnacle of an insurance scheme like that.<br /><br />This is, ultimately, why Libertarianism is a load of wank that only healthy young people straight from momma&#039;s spare room seem to guzzle up.<br /><br />Oh yes, your taxation also pays for the jails and the police. No taxation and the cops go home and the prisoners get let out. I don&#039;t give three flying fucks how hard you say or think you are, that&#039;s a lot arse rape you have to face immediately prior to the *ACTUAL* theft of *ALL* your good shit. And, with a bleeding anus no hospital will treat, and no possessions, just you wait till they light your home on fire. <br /><br />No Libertarian fireman is going to come out and put out that fire out of a sense of altruism... and you don&#039;t got shit to PAY with... so he&#039;ll SHRUG LIKE ATLAS and watch that motherfucker BURN!<br /><br />This is not to say there is nothing about Libertarianism that&#039;s worthwhile. But it&#039;s like any doctrine or creed - Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Capitalism, Communism, whatever, - the fanatics are destructive weirdoes. Always. Because they&#039;re fanatic. And weird.<br />

It&#039;s a bitch of a disease :(<br /><br />And, agreed again. Taxes are theft is one of these ridiculous tenets I will never understand. How narrow-minded does one have to be to subscribe to it? In the US they have this saying that goes &quot;Republicans are democrats after being mugged&quot;, I&#039;d go one further and say &quot;libertarians are republicans that haven&#039;t been kicked in the groin by life yet&quot; ...<br /><br />To believe that Shell/BP/Exxon would stop polluting for any other reason than government sanctions is ridiculous, just look at Southern Africa. To think that big corp would fund a proper school system for all out of &quot;self-interest&quot; is laughable, just look at Nevada. To think that big corp would innovate and improve to gain market share when it is so much cheaper and efficient to displace/buy-out/destroy is preposterous, or why do you think that semi-socialist Northern European countries have cheap 100/100 home fiber lines while &quot;free market&quot; US customers usually have one carrier available that offers 35mbit lines as &quot;high-speed&quot; highly overpriced and without competition in their respective local markets? To believe that somehow UPS will build proper roads to your suburban home so they can deliver packages there is just so naive, but a core libertarian belief. Someone wanting to do business will do it somehow...<br /><br />There are things to be said for libertarianism, I still like some of it&#039;s core ideas. The problem is, as always, human nature. Libertarians solely rely on punishment after the fact, but if a corporation kills me with poisoned food that won&#039;t do me much good now will it? I don&#039;t want to be one of the hundreds of people dying in a faulty car that are needed for market forces to kick in so people stop buying the bad car. I dun give a shit if&nbsp; my death will eventually make people choose another car.<br /><br />To circle back to Ayn Rand, here is yet another reason why libertarians religiously following her writings should scratch their heads. Libertarians commonly stipulate that taking care of the disadvantaged/ill/incapable should be done through charity and not by the state. However, charity is an expression of altruism, without altruism, there can be no charity. So please do tell libertarian Ayn Rand followers, if the state does not take care of the fallen and weak ones, but Randian thought says that altruism is bad, then who will take care of those that didn&#039;t make it? What are we going to do with them?<br /><br />In lessaiz-faire capitalism, all that is self-interest is allowed. One common big-corp practice in the US is to have people work for your company for decades by promising pensions, etc., but when the pension liabilities become high corporations simply restructure their debt, and pensioners are fucked out of what they thought was their nest egg. Detestable practice, but it happens on a daily basis in the US. According to Randian thought these fucked-over individuals are &quot;the weak&quot;, not deserving of love, and not entitled to altruistic measures to lighten their burden.<br /><br />I guess my question is, what are you going to do with all those that don&#039;t become industrial magnates? Because according to her, those are the only ones deserving of any consideration at all. Are we going eskimo and start to send those that have expired useful shelf-lives off on an ice shoal? This is the great question that no libertarian has answered to this point. All you get is vague and ambiguous insinuations that the invisible hand will take care of that somehow, which is yet another &quot;Randian Paradox&quot;, because by her own philosophy and writings one should not rely on the metaphysical but on reason. Somehow the market will solve that somewhen is an epitome of the metaphysical.

Or the idea that an individual shouldn&#039;t be extracted to pay for something they don&#039;t want. The source of aggression and destructiveness lies in our culture, not in the individual, and the state propagates that agression. And everything that reinforces the fragmentation of our personality and closes off access to our inner world contributes to the creation and growth of our destructive drives. And again, the state reinforces this aggressive nature through taxation, incarceration, the constant yearning for war, the whole thing is stone cold evil. There has got to be a better way.

Riddle me this then. The US has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world. Higher than those of the last remaining communist nations China and Cuba.<br /><br />As it just so happens, historically, the rise in incarceration coincided with the rise of the privately owned prison-industrial-complex. Wall St. just looooooooves incarcerating non-violent offenders and drug users because there is really big money in it, look up some of the most notorious players on a stock ticker, your eyes will pop. You thought prostitution is recession-proof? Try incarceration! <br /><br />Those that think the war on drugs was an oppressive government project should rethink their stance and do some real digging into how most of the draconian drug laws came into being. One of the foulest and vile players in that field is ALEC - a.k.a the American Legislative Exchange Council, a darling think tank of many a conservative and libertarian. They have systematically bought up conservative and libertarian candidates brute-forcing draconian incarceration policies into state after state. Of course most libertarians will attribute the US&#039;s high incarceration rate to oppressive government, when in fact free-market privateers are the driving force behind it.<br /><br />Mind you, I am not defending the government as such, most current govs are broken and corrupted beyond belief. But again, their &quot;brokenness&quot; is the result of free-market self-interest, not a stymieing force working against it.<br /><br />Let me formulate it another way, drawing another parallel here. Most libertarians are ardent defenders of the right to bear arms (lets not derail into that debate though), their line of argument usually is that guns don&#039;t do bad deeds, the people with the gun do the bad deed. If you subscribe to that logic, however, then I could stipulate that the same applies to government. Government is merely the instrument, just like the gun. It is in the way that this instrument is used that defines whether the outcome is good or bad.<br /><br />Now lets compare. The US has by and large the biggest privately owned prison-industrial complex, and, it has the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world. Most other Western, democratic first world countries that have no to limited privatization have much lower incarceration (and incidentally also recidivism) rates.<br /><br />This begs the question if privatization paired with Randian self-interest propagation is the culprit here. After all, this modus operandi of big corporations using their political influence to lobby draconian incarceration policies into law to feed the complex is merely an expression of &quot;free trade&quot; entities looking out for their own interest. This is what happens if you incorporate an attitude of &quot;free trade profit motive&quot; being the pinnacle of noble motivations.<br /><br />Sound about right?

				As I have said before in these forums, a major difficulty I see with libertarianism is &#039;how do we get there from here?&#039; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clearly most libertarians would agree that our current system consists of a terrible distortion of the free market, and thus the wealthy under this system are not the most deserving or hard working, but those who have played our corrupt system most successfully.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, Libertarian year zero. The state is abolished (or shrunk to a rump legal system to enforce contracts and perhaps keep the peace). But let&#039;s say you have 1000000 bitcoin and I have 10. You also have 100000 acres of land which fortunately contains an oil well and a supply of fresh water and a port. (you were cunning enough to acquire these advantages by bribing politicians etc under our present fascist system) Alas, I am a landless peasant.&nbsp; Let&#039;s play a few generations of &#039;free market&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hmmmm. My descendants still appear to be working for your descendants. They seeming to be working really hard but are struggling to pay the rent on the house you rent them. After they pay the fuel and water and food bills (all to you or your class) every month they have nothing left.....meanwhile your descendants get more and more wealthy. I guess they must be a naturally superior kind of people?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seems then that to begin a Libertarian society some kind of redistribution of illegitimately acquired wealth might be in order. But how to achieve this without violating the first libertarian commandment &#039;do no harm&#039;? We cannot seize wealth by violence as that will make our claim equally illegitimate.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another difficulty I have with libertarianism is the characterisation of most of those in class 1 or 2 as lazy, parasitic useless mouths. No doubt some are, but many of the unemployed are both capable and willing to work, its just that the tidal fluctuations of the market have left them high and dry. &quot;Ah hah!&quot; crys the libertarian &quot;but this is because of government interference; under a truly free market, the surplus labour will cause wages to drop until we have nearly full employment&quot; But, high unemployment in Europe and US is a result of factories etc moving to poorer countrys where wages are lower. I have heard libertarians argue that under a free market, wages and living conditions will rise in these countrys. This makes sense, if we had a free market you would expect conditions to equalise.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, it seems likely that the market might prefer higher unemployment than society finds desirable. High unemployment keeps wages low and so might be more profitable than full employment, despite 10% of people lying idle. The market has no mechanism to correct this. (you can contradict me here, but this is a well understood and widely accepted criticism of lassiez faire)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once wages have equalised worldwide we might run into another problem: increased automation. Already most manufacturing is done by robots. The humans are basically employed to load/unload the robots. If in the future robots become cheaper and cheaper (as seems likely) then less and less humans will be needed. We would then see the paradox of technology producing great abundance, and yet much of the population being unemployed. Would anyone argue that the unemployed in this situation are lazy parasites?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The contrasting assumption is that those in classes 3 and 4 are the virtuous engines of society. Particularly that those in class 4, driven to enrich themselves at all costs, are mostly engaged in useful and productive work. This is certainly the case for many of the entrepreneurs and businessmen. But what about the large number who are engaged in buying and selling derivatives? What useful function does this wholesale gambling serve, other to enrich the participants? Since the market for these financial instruments exceeds the &#039;real&#039; economy by several orders of magnitude this is an important question.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, I want to discuss that classic libertarian trope: that taxation is theft. if you do not pay your taxes, men with guns will come and put you in prison. Why should the government decide what I spend my money on? if I wanted to give to charity etc etc. Often the words &#039;mafia&#039; and &#039;protection racket&#039; feature.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well guys, got some bad news for you: at whatever point in history you lived, men with weapons ruled over you. They took a certain fraction of your produce, and in return they promised to protect you with their weapons. When america was colonised, the first thing the colonists did was evict the previous occupants with their superior weapons. They pretty quickly established a new government backed by men with guns (I admit I am compressing history somewhat here!)<br />Libertarians basically say &quot;Fuck this! If I want men with weapons, I will HIRE MY OWN!&quot; The trouble with hiring men with guns, though, as many small time dictators&nbsp; discovered too late, is: they have guns. As Kipling put it &quot;when you have once paid the Danegeld, you can never get rid of the Dane&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If we were to get rid of the current government, I predict that before long you would be paying &#039;taxes&#039; to a genuine mafia. At least under the current system the protection money is used to provide care for the elderly and poor and sick.&nbsp; I really have no problem with money being taken by force from the wealthy and used to deal with some of the problems caused by their activities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, a lot of the tax money is spent on things like putting drug users in prison and waging wars on oil producing countrys. I agree that these should cease, but this is not a problem with taxation. Its a problem with the current government. It does not make taxation itself illegitimate.( And, by golly, we do like oil. In a libertarian society perhaps the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan would have been carried out by BP and Shell directly, rather then their government sock puppets.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Put simply, my main problem with libertarianism is that it idolises the market above all else. The market is a fantastic mechanism for determining prices but its decisions are not it binding. We should be free to interfere with it wherever we see fit, the market is robust enough to adjust to whatever we do. So things like banning child labour, providing welfare to unemployed, and regulating employment conditions are all fine, despite being anathema to libertarians.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In particular, the libertarian stance on child labour demonstrates their extremist philosophy perfectly. In this forum I have seen libertarians argue, in all seriousness, that laws restricting very young children from working are wrong, as they interfere with that child&#039;s rights. &quot;If a child wants to work, because his family need the money, who are we to stop him&quot;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I leave that for your consideration<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Just a clarification on the fly here. There was talk of the &quot;fascist&quot; government (presumably US) and this always makes me cringe. The US government is anything but fascist.<br /><br />Granted cops in SWAT gear breaking down grandma&#039;s front door ransacking the house because little Billy bought a gram of weed earlier in the day obviously is quite reminiscent of the brownshirts kicking in doors to look for Jews, but that doesn&#039;t mean that the government system is fascist.<br /><br />The three defining characteristics of fascism are ultranationalism (check), militarism (check) and control of the regime over national resources and production while retaining private property.<br /><br />And therein lies the crux. In the US, government doesn&#039;t control big business, big business owns government. Also, the nationalism aspect is also weak at best, for underneath all the red white and blue redderick and national pride pomp the leaders of the US ever so happily stand by as big multinational corporations sell the country out to China, export jobs to wherever labor is cheap and watch the national currency deteriorate.<br /><br />Now, granted, there are many aspects that are reminiscent of fascist regimes throughout history, but by definition, the US can&#039;t be fascist because it lacks certain key characteristics of fascism. I&#039;m not saying that the system is any better than fascism, just wanted to point it out as I am a stickler for proper labels :P

				As a sidebar (not sure how it fits in to either side of argument) I recommend a book&nbsp; &nbsp;&#039;the new Jim Crow&#039; and a film &#039;the house I live in&#039; both about the prison system in america. Both portray the prison industry as largely economic in motivation. With the collapse of heavy industry in the US due to cheaper labour costs elsewhere, many cities are left with a huge surplus of mostly black workers. In most inner cities the vacuum has been filled by the drug business. The inhabitants of these areas&nbsp; are not criminals, they are simply taking the only form of gainful employment available.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time the huge prison complexes are major employers that bring great economic benefit to the area. So its a win win; by passing punitive laws against drugs the troublesome surplus black workers can be rounded up and imprisoned, at the same time providing jobs for other impoverished communities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The logical next step would be to use the imprisoned workers as slave labour to produce goods for sale and indeed this is already beginning.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#039;m not sure how these things fit into the argument about libertarianism, as I am unclear how laws will be enforced or even made without a central government funded by taxation. I suspect many libertarians are also unclear on this.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mean, clearly the legal system could be made self funding by levying large fines, seizing assets and forcing prisoners to work, but introducing the profit motive in this way could have negative consequences on the impartiality of judiciary!

Some utopia... you can keep that.<br /><br />No matter what your stance on this is, whether it is morally okay to let people die or not, whether you favor socialistic or libertarian approaches, no libertarian ever answers the question, what do you do with the uninsured if they have an emergency? Do you just let them die on the road? How long do you think it will take until the mob starts rioting in the street if you have uncle Bobs and granny Maples dieing in the streets everywhere? All libertarians offer is some metaphysical insinuation that somehow this will sort itself out if only regulation is removed. Might as well try praying...<br />

				Put simply, most modern societies are a symbiosis between the State and the Market. Both are necessary for a functional society.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Communism is the belief that we can do without the market, the state will provide and decide everything.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Libertarianism is the idea that we can do without the state, the market will provide and decide everything.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both are flawed, utopian philosophys that could not be made to work in the real world.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think the problems with communism as it was tried in USSR are so well known as to need little discussion here.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My main objection to libertarianism us that it refuses to acknowledge the inequities of capitalism. In the libertarian world view, the poor are poor because they are lazy and unimaginative. The rich are rich due to their hard work and superior merit. I think this is why it is so popular in the US, where the myth that anyone can make it rich if only they try hard enough is engrained in the culture. In fact social mobility in the US is very restrictive. The children of rich parents get all the advantages of good education, good health care, good diet and access to finance, and thus have much greater opportunity than similar poor children.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is a fact that most poor people work extremely hard merely to maintain their position. They are paid sufficient to feed and house themselves in most cases but lacking capital their only option is to sell their labour to employers. The employers, possessing capital use it to purchase raw materials, machinery and labour, and sell the goods thus produced for a profit, enabling them to live well for much less work. This is then characterised as &#039;providing work&#039; for the poor and is regarded as great generosity.

				The whole &#039;men with guns&#039; argument is tired, and relies on a very tendential, emotive characterisation of taxation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nearly everyone, even libertarians, agree that use of force is justifiable in certain circumstances. For instance, a man has a knife to someone&#039;s throat, most people would accept the use of force to prevent murder.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But what if one person has plenty of food, and another is starving to death. Is it acceptable to use force to redistribute the food? I would say yes, but most libertarians would say no I think?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These two situations are not the same, but they do both exist on a line running from &#039;acceptable use of force&#039; to &#039;unacceptable force&#039;.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Further along the same line is:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One man has a nice iPhone, another does not. Clearly no one would argue it is acceptable for the phone less man to seize it by force.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, its not black and white. Redistributive taxation falls somewhere along the line. It depends on your beliefs whether you place it closer to one end it the other. But to characterize it as &#039;men with guns coming to takje your money by force&#039; is a distortion.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Libertarians often talk as if they would prefer a voluntary system. So instead of playing taxes for police, fire service, roads etc. they would choose to pay into the system of their choosing for these services.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What they overlook is that the current system of taxation IS voluntary. If you don&#039;t like it you can take your business elsewhere, to a country where the taxation system is more to your liking. By choosing to live in a country you are accepting its laws....

That doesn&#039;t mean we shouldn&#039;t be grateful for the things we have. For instance we still have nuclear bombs, just in case we want to end the world i guess? I think it&#039;s rather childish, it&#039;s like these leaders have no foresight whatsoever. Does anyone give a fuck about the children of the future? I guess they&#039;ll just leave it for the next generation to decide. The part about saying i choose not to contribute doesn&#039;t make much sense to me, because i can think of plenty of people who do just that.<br /><br />Mental slavery isn&#039;t much better than physical slavery, if anything it&#039;s worse. This is the case for a large majority of the population. They are either too lazy or unintelligent to educate themselves. If humans continue down the road of endless consumption there may not be any more species on this planet. If there are it certainly won&#039;t be humans. Personally i like humans, I think some of us are fucking great. I&#039;m all for keeping our species alive and going into space. If we don&#039;t kill ourselves before we leave the planet then something from outerspace will. The universe could honestly care less.<br /><br />Personally i believe the amount of left over money that is WASTED, on the countless wars would be more than enough to provide people with quality educations, better healthcare, food and housing. That doesn&#039;t even factor in the other useless services people unwittingly waste their tax dollars on. After that we could work on viable solutions for overpopulation and get serious about space exploration. <br /><br />I agree that many libertarians opinions aren&#039;t exactly agreeable with reality, although at least some of them are trying to think. The argument of &quot;since we didn&#039;t come up with anything better, the system we have must be the best there is&quot; is utter bullshit in my opinion, and isn&#039;t much better. You guys act like being born in a country is fucking optional, you think the people in north korea agree with you? It isn&#039;t exactly easy to move from one country to another. And even if you did the most of the same fuckheads with no foresight except monetary growth are still in charge, making the laws. Deciding the future of humanity for us.

Presumably those now unemployed would be provided with sub current minimum wage work which they would be forced to accept&nbsp; by removal of benefits. Is this an improvement?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Secondly, this is once again the pernicious myth that someone born into poor circumstances has plenty of chances to work hard, go to college and change their life, and therefore those who fail to do this are deserving of their fate.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Libertarians talk about freedom a lot but why should a child born to poor parents have so much less opportunity than one born into wealth? I am reminded of the phrase &quot;justice in England is like the Ritz hotel: open to everyone&quot; The whole aim of redistributive taxation is to level this uneven playing field somewhat.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I remember seeing an episode of &quot;The Secret Millionaire&quot; (a sick making maudlin show where some wealthy nouveau riche type goes to a poor neighbourhood in guise of a fellow pauper, involves himself in some worthy projects and on the last day whips off his mask and starts handing out cheques and patronising praise). This particular program featured a young man from a wealthy suburb of Liverpool whos father had a large student property portfolio. On his 18th birthday his dad gave him £1 million, with the understanding he would have to manage with that. The boy proudly described how by buying student property during the boom of the early century he had doubled his money to £2million, and paid his father back. He therefore regarded himself as a self made millionaire. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After I took my foot out of the TV, I reflected that this little Lord Fauntleroy would probably look down on the poor oiks who hadn&#039;t made a fortune out of property to lift themselves out of poverty.... after all he had managed. They must just be lazy or stupid or both.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thing is that a child born to wealthy parents can be lazy or stupid and make plenty of mistakes but still go to college and be given a well paying job by daddy&#039;s friends. A child born in the hood who dares take his eyes off the ball briefly will end up stuck in a rut of poverty, working two jobs to pay the bills, no time to consider education and god help him if he falls expensively I&#039;ll or has legal trouble or is black.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have no problem with taxation taking money from the wealthy to attempt to provide the poor with some of the opportunities for self improvement that they may lack. The better off aren&#039;t going to do this voluntarily. My definition of freedom rates equality of opportunity more highly than an individuals right to use their wealth to acquire advantages for their children.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Libertarianism&nbsp; promises freedom for the rich to oppress the poor. Their is an unpleasant thread of social Darwinism present in its advocates.....they constantly talk about the poor in such terms as lazy, unmotivated, parasites. You always get the impression they are imagining themselves as being healthy, wealthy and successful under a libertarian system, so why should they pay for the upkeep of an indigent pauper class?

				I&#039;m in a simular boat to you, used to strongly champion libertarianism in all its forms, but after studying sociology my opinion somewhat shifted. I think libertarianism is the default of what human social structures will shift towards - we are naturally selfish (or self-interested) and unchecked we will seek to acquire as much liberty as possible. That is only a problem when the liberties you take impact other people - and in this complex world they almost always do. <br />My position now centres more around communitarianism - I recognise individual success relies heavily on others. No individual achievements would be possible without all of our collective achievements. Humans are at their greatest when we work together.<br />You should read John Stewart Mills, he was very competent in articulating libertarianism. I agree whole heartedly with his &quot;harm theory&quot; - no law should prohibit behaviour that does not dirrectly impact another human being.<br />That&#039;s my rant done

So instead of playing taxes for police, fire service, roads etc. they would choose to pay into the system of their choosing for these services.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What they overlook is that the current system of taxation IS voluntary. If you don&#039;t like it you can take your business elsewhere, to a country where the taxation system is more to your liking. By choosing to live in a country you are accepting its laws....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I am ashamed of this argument.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You shouldn&#039;t be, for it is right. Most libertarians hold the belief that just being born means some sort of inherent set of &quot;rights&quot; is bestowed upon them. I think that humans are just another species of animals, so the only right you really have is to be eaten by the next best thing that is faster, stronger, better suited to eat you. The reason we aren&#039;t being eaten is that we have achieved a certain level of intellectual and technological superiority over claws and fangs. When you are born you benefit from this, hence you are &quot;indebted&quot; to your herd for it has made that possible. You can&#039;t just reach adulthood by the grace of these benefits and then say oh hai, I dun like that, I choose not to contribute to it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I think slaves said something similiar to &quot;oh hai, I dun like that, I choose not to contribute to it.&quot;&nbsp; Not everything we&#039;ve been provided by our herd is beneficial, in fact a lot of it is detrimental. That doesn&#039;t mean we shouldn&#039;t be grateful for the things we have. For instance we still have nuclear bombs, just in case we want to end the world i guess? I think it&#039;s rather childish, it&#039;s like these leaders have no foresight whatsoever. Does anyone give a fuck about the children of the future? I guess they&#039;ll just leave it for the next generation to decide. The part about saying i choose not to contribute doesn&#039;t make much sense to me, because i can think of plenty of people who do just that.<br /><br />Mental slavery isn&#039;t much better than physical slavery, if anything it&#039;s worse. This is the case for a large majority of the population. They are either too lazy or unintelligent to educate themselves. If humans continue down the road of endless consumption there may not be any more species on this planet. If there are it certainly won&#039;t be humans. Personally i like humans, I think some of us are fucking great. I&#039;m all for keeping our species alive and going into space. If we don&#039;t kill ourselves before we leave the planet then something from outerspace will. The universe could honestly care less.<br /><br />Personally i believe the amount of left over money that is WASTED, on the countless wars would be more than enough to provide people with quality educations, better healthcare, food and housing. That doesn&#039;t even factor in the other useless services people unwittingly waste their tax dollars on. After that we could work on viable solutions for overpopulation and get serious about space exploration. <br /><br />I agree that many libertarians opinions aren&#039;t exactly agreeable with reality, although at least some of them are trying to think. The argument of &quot;since we didn&#039;t come up with anything better, the system we have must be the best there is&quot; is utter bullshit in my opinion, and isn&#039;t much better. You guys act like being born in a country is fucking optional, you think the people in north korea agree with you? It isn&#039;t exactly easy to move from one country to another. And even if you did the most of the same fuckheads with no foresight except monetary growth are still in charge, making the laws. Deciding the future of humanity for us.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So if &quot;the market&quot; tells you fucko, you is shit out of luck, you trained the wrong skills, you made the wrong investment, you made a/some wrong decision(s), please confine yourself to a life of mere substandard subsistence then that is okay, if you are born into a country with taxation that tells you fucko you want to use lighted roads and get an ambulance to get you if need be and we make sure big corp doesn&#039;t poison you then that is terrible and tyranny.<br /><br />I guess what I am trying to say is I can&#039;t for the life of me understand how (radical) libertarians make that distinction that being tyrannized by society/government is da worst thing evah whereas being tyrannized by capital is just great and dandy. To me being tyrannized is always terrible regardless of the source of said tyranny. And make no mistake, it has become painfully obvious what big capital will do to you without blinking once over the last couple decades. In the US, every major bill deregulating something has resulted in people getting hurt big time by the $$$-elite.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the thing, and this is my beef with libertarians, there has never been a truly libertarian society in world history. Hence, all the assertions that some invisible greater force will swoop in and make everything right for everyone if only any and all regulation is removed can be regarded as little more as wishful thinking. There isn&#039;t really any scientific indication that anything would get better. For all we know things would get worse. To go back to the US as an example: banking got deregulated, look at what happened in 2007/2008 (number of financial breakdowns in Canada since the nation was founded: 0), telecommunications got deregulated look what happened. Most Americans have literally only one carrier available to them, whilst people in &quot;socialist hell&quot; Europe get to choose between 3 or 4 different carriers offering 50/50 highspeed lines.<br /><br />And that&#039;s just it, most hardcore libertarians seem almost like religious people to me, for they don&#039;t base their assertions of what would be not on observation of that which we have already seen, but on something that is mere belief, just like Jesus (I&#039;m an ardent atheist by the way so that wasn&#039;t a compliment).<br /><br />Long story short: show me one sports team that will improve it&#039;s performance by removing a formal training regimen, show me one business organization that will improve it&#039;s profit by removing conduct regulations and requirements from its employees, it just doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br />Does that mean the status quo is acceptable or even good? No, of course not, most governments in the world are broken beyond belief, however, the solution to that is fix government, not get rid of it. The proper solution to slippery slopes is proper oversight, not inaction. <br /><br />If the last 300 years have taught us anything then it is that the proper response is democracy with sensible oversight and regulation.<br /><br />As for the poor man/rich man comparisons above, I don&#039;t want to punish or take from an achiever, but I do want a society where the playing field is level and everyone starts from the same starting line. Libertarianism will invariably lead to a situation where the financially privileged will start 50 yards ahead of everyone on the inside track, that is not freedom, that is not liberty, it&#039;s oppression only that here money is used to oppress instead of state force.

Nobody is depriving you of shit, you want to deprive others of the right to not be insured and apparently you want to deprive the hospital of the right to treat whoever they want.

				By the way I suspect the reason that US citizens are more charitable is because they need to be, as their government is failing to care for its less fortunate citizens properly. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is always amusing the way libertarians characterise anyone who disagrees with their extremist philosophy as communist. We are not communist or socialist. It&#039;s just our culture hasn&#039;t taken as big a swing to the right as yours in the past 40 years. In the 50s and 60s the US government enjoyed the greatest period of growth in recent history while enacting policies that you would no doubt characterise as extreme socialism.

				According to a Harvard study medical bills is the biggest and most prevalent cause of bankruptcy filings in the US accounting for 62.1% of all personal bankruptcies filed. Poor and/or excessive/irresponsible use of credit only ranks at number three. I guess there is less charity than you thought then maybe? Even more peculiar, the study found that 78% of those cases involved people that actually had paid for some form of health insurance. <br /><br />But hey, at least we aren&#039;t under the tyranny of having to suffer regulations that would force insurers to do what you paid for instead of finding reasons to drop you off the plan so the ever-present and abundantly available charities can take over. /sarcasm<br /><br />***CLEARNET***<br /><br />http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/petrie-flom/workshop/pdf/warren.pdf<br /><br />***CLEARNET***<br /><br />So, basically, that whole wall of text tl;dr rant of &quot;commie circle jerks&quot; was nothing but the usual semi-illiterate ideologically charged ramblings one usually gets to hear on the intarwebz.

That means very limited government. Not ZERO government which would be anarchy. Basic laws would be in place to protect life, liberty and private property. Fraud, murder, rape, assault, abduction, extortion, property destruction and pollution would all be covered by these laws and fully punishable by criminal penalties. Civil penalties would also apply under a modified court system where the plaintiff and defendant would be on equal footing unlike how it is today. All trade, production and creation would be completely unregulated and no permission would be needed from the government to do any of those things. Money would be completely unregulated and untracked. Legal tender laws would be thrown in the trash heap of history and people would be able to trade amongst themselves however they see fit with whichever currencies they choose. They could even introduce their very own currencies for this purpose. The terrible distortion of the money supply that&#039;s fucking up everything today would almost instantly cease to exist when that happened. So would the capacity for the government to wage war domestically and internationally. And government&#039;s ability to expand would be halted. Permanently.<br /><br />This would lead to a minimum reduction in the size of government of 90%. Taxes would plummet accordingly and so would the prison population. I don&#039;t know about you but that&#039;s the kind of world I want to live in. The current one is turning into an Orwellian nightmare with unlimited government crushing anything and everything in its path that is seen as a threat to the fascist Establishment. Unlimited wars. Unlimited taxes. Unlimited debt. Unlimited destruction. FUCK THAT.

				Oh it sounds awesome! Sign me up, I&#039;d love all that! Seriously, I mean it.<br /><br />But then again, as the original poster has so astutely observed, it has one fundamental chink, the very same chink communism had................. it fails to account for human nature, and stipulates that some superordinate metaphysical mechanism will make it all right somehow.<br /><br />The power amassed by the few is so tremendous that no market mechanism in the world could possible provide a level playing field. Look at the US, do you think people will start moving away from their jobs and homes because they are unhappy with the fact that there is only one utilities provider in any given region establishing defacto pricing monopolies? Do you think people will give up careers to move somewhere else where another cable provider provides better internet speeds? These issues aren&#039;t caused by government, they are caused by entities becoming so big and powerful that it becomes cheaper to outspend upcoming competition than to innovate.<br /><br />That is the problem with this whole libertarian thought. Wealth and power are too concentrated already. They can leverage any market dynamic simply by outspending it.<br /><br />Yes, nowadays governments are pretty much shite and they make shite policies, but, please do tell if you will, since most governments are big-corp pwns these days, what makes you think that the very big corp entities that buy up entire governments would behave better if you were to remove the last couple restrictions that are placed on them? Do you think anyone in big oil, big power, big healthcare is even still susceptible to 100, 500, 100, 10,000 rage-quitters? They fart on that!<br /><br />There is no invention or market interruption in sight that would theoretically allow for new players to become so succesful in basically anything that they would be able to shake up the top 10% of the global money machines.<br /><br />How would you handle that? How would these libertarian market mechanisms ensure that the required market interruptions would be met with innovation instead of being simply smothered with a money pillow?<br /><br />I like these libertarian ideas, I really do. Gosh who wouldn&#039;t want to live in a &quot;fair&quot; world like that. The thing is though, it&#039;s simply unrealistic and unfeasible. There is no empirical evidence in history whatsoever that would indicate that abandoning the vast majority of regulations would indeed improve anything for anyone except the top 10% money elite of the world. The division of labor has advanced way too fast to be leveraged by mechanisms that may have worked well in a world of Peter builds cabinets, George is a doctor, Peter is sick and George needs a new cabinet, Susan adds a chicken for some medicine.<br /><br />Ever since humans started banding together to hunt mammoth the same structures emerged, from pack leaders to dukes and counts and kings to presidents and chancellors and central committee secretaries to CEO/CFOs.

				No, Totalibertarians are against terrorism and hope to struggle against the terroristic states to overthrow them from power. We also against the terrorists in society and want to smash them into submission. Once we take over the world libertarianism will be strictly enforced, and even if 80% of the world says they want something different well they can get fucked. Totalibertarianism is a benevolent dictatorship with visions of global domination. We will violently force the world to be free and relentlessly punish those who do not want it to be. People can beg us to allow slavery, they can vote for slavery in overwhelming numbers, but we will tell them they cannot have it. The people can beg us and plead with us to censor information, but we will tell them that information is free regardless of what they wish. The people can protest us telling us we must allow them to steal, but we will never allow this to happen regardless of how much they beg and plead with us. Society can say that their social contract said people cannot use drugs, and we will laugh hysterically at them and say that we have revoked their social contract. Wealth and prosperity will sweep the nations, people will be full in the streets, and as much as they beg us otherwise we will not allow it. When the supporters of the state move to arrest prostitutes we will immediately charge them with kidnapping and send them to rot in prison. When they try to steal drugs from drug dealers we will charge them with armed robbery and send them to rot in prison. When they try to arrest people for viewing pictures, be they of muhammed or naked 15 year olds, we will charge them with kidnapping and send them to prisons. Indeed we will build massive prisons on isolated islands and ship all of the loyalists of the state to them, where they will live a life of modest inconvenience until they are educated as to the wrongness of their deeds (although we may need a purge of some of them, to make a statement against the freedom they have allowed!). <br /><br />Trust me, in a totalibertarian society there is no freedom of the people. They can want to rob and kill and murder and oppress and we will not allow it, despite the wishes of the majority! We will use giant weapons and a massive force of soldiers to rip the freedom to oppress from the people. In Totalibertarianism, there is no individual choice, an individual can not choose to steal from others or to oppress others. Only the laws of the Worlds Totalibertarian Army matter at all, and it does not matter how many others are against them they will be violently enforced across the world.

We also against the terrorists in society and want to smash them into submission. Once we take over the world libertarianism will be strictly enforced, and even if 80% of the world says they want something different well they can get fucked. Totalibertarianism is a benevolent dictatorship with visions of global domination. We will violently force the world to be free and relentlessly punish those who do not want it to be. People can beg us to allow slavery, they can vote for slavery in overwhelming numbers, but we will tell them they cannot have it. The people can beg us and plead with us to censor information, but we will tell them that information is free regardless of what they wish. The people can protest us telling us we must allow them to steal, but we will never allow this to happen regardless of how much they beg and plead with us. Society can say that their social contract said people cannot use drugs, and we will laugh hysterically at them and say that we have revoked their social contract. Wealth and prosperity will sweep the nations, people will be full in the streets, and as much as they beg us otherwise we will not allow it. When the supporters of the state move to arrest prostitutes we will immediately charge them with kidnapping and send them to rot in prison. When they try to steal drugs from drug dealers we will charge them with armed robbery and send them to rot in prison. When they try to arrest people for viewing pictures, be they of muhammed or naked 15 year olds, we will charge them with kidnapping and send them to prisons. Indeed we will build massive prisons on isolated islands and ship all of the loyalists of the state to them, where they will live a life of modest inconvenience until they are educated as to the wrongness of their deeds (although we may need a purge of some of them, to make a statement against the freedom they have allowed!). <br /><br />Trust me, in a totalibertarian society there is no freedom of the people. They can want to rob and kill and murder and oppress and we will not allow it, despite the wishes of the majority! We will use giant weapons and a massive force of soldiers to rip the freedom to oppress from the people. In Totalibertarianism, there is no individual choice, an individual can not choose to steal from others or to oppress others. Only the laws of the Worlds Totalibertarian Army matter at all, and it does not matter how many others are against them they will be violently enforced across the world.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />HEIL LIBERTY!

Indeed, our policies will be beneficial for them! The only people who are against Totalibertarianism are brainwashed, or they are evil people such as thieves. Indeed, no other political philosophy is as peaceful as ours, or as tolerant as ours. Nobody has a legitimate reason to fear us or to not support us, our desire is to abolish all laws other than the most fundamental laws that no reasonable person could possibly disagree with. We will strictly ban murder, rape, and stealing, as well as other similar crimes. However, we are perfectly tolerant of the drug dealers, of the CP viewers, the drug users, the men who wish to have sex with young people who are at least old enough to consent, of the racists who wish to discriminate in hiring practices, of the minority races who do not wish to be enslaved, of the people who produce and want to keep what they produce, of the people who do not want to pay extortion money to the government, the prostitutes and the johns, the religious people who do not wish to force their religious belief on others as well as the non-religious people who do not wish for beliefs to be forced onto them, of the business owners who wish to run their stores how they see fit, the product inventors who wish for their products to be regulated as they see fit, the people who wish to use only certified products, the gays who wish to marry, the people of the world! The list goes on and on, indeed the peace and tolerance of Totalibertarianism is nearly infinite in scope! <br /><br />So you do not need to fear us if you are a good person, and no children need to run from us. Rather you should run to us and join us in our global struggle to dominate the world and enforce the principles of Totalibertarianism, which indeed are indistinguishable from the principles of Tolerance and Peace.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Conform with our non-conformity or be dominated...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do you think that we should allow the thieves to continue robbing? If the majority desires so? Should we allow the slave traders to continue to enslave people for their profits? If the majority so desires? People who do not conform to Totalibertarianism OUGHT to be dominated. Almost nobody even wants the level of freedom offered by totalibertarianism, so it is not like people can say we do not support freedom! In their minds our problem is that we support too much freedom! Under our rule not enough people are enslaved! We offer far more freedom than the masses desire, anyone who does not conform to our policies must be dominated for the good of human kind. We cannot allow for a democracy to dictate the laws, democracy is a failed experiment. The only way for a better society is for the entire world to be dominated by a benevolent force.<br /><br />Totalibertarianism is Orwellian in a way.

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Totalitarianism (or totalitarian rule) is a term employed by some political scientists to describe a political system in which the state holds total authority over the society and seeks to control all aspects of public and private life wherever possible.[1]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds great to me! We need a force to hold total authority over society and to control all aspects of public and private life. We need this force to prevent people from stealing, to prevent people for robbing and raping and murdering. Every single aspect of every individuals life should be under strict control, either to prevent them from doing bad things or to prevent people from doing bad things to them. See, Totalibertarians want your life to be under complete control and they want you to have no freedom at all to go against the principles of Totalibertarianism. But it is actually great, because they don&#039;t want to prevent you from doing much! Indeed, they want to let you do more and have more choices about your life than any other political organization ever has in the history of humanity! And yes, they want to hold total authority over society, but it is not a bad thing! They need total authority over society to prevent bad people from doing bad things and to prevent bad people from telling good people what they can and cannot do. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Totalitarianism is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds great to me! There should be no social or economic institutions that are not under the complete control of Totalibertarians. If society is not dominated by totalibertarians, we will have situations where certain groups, such as drug users, are sent to prisons as slaves of the state. We will have the majority of people saying that gay people cannot get married. We will have people robbing others with a cloak of legitimacy. None of this is acceptable and it cannot be tolerated in the slightest, and the only way to prevent these horrible things from happening is if Totalibertarians are in complete control of all social and economic institutions. Now being in complete control doesn&#039;t mean that they will do bad things, it means that they will prevent bad things from being done! That is the primary difference between classical totalitarianism and Totalibertarianism. Any form of totalitarianism that is not totalibertarianism is the epitome of evil, of intolerance and of war, so conversely Totalibertarianism is the epitome of Good, of Tolerance and of Peace. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; Elaborate guiding ideology.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Single mass party, typically led by a dictator.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; System of terror, using such instruments as violence and secret police.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Monopoly on weapons.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Monopoly on the means of communication.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Central direction and control of the economy through state planning.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Sounds mostly fine to me! Society should be guided by the elaborate ideology of libertarianism. Once we have made all things any reasonable person would consider acceptable to be legal, then there are no more slaves. There is no more worthy controversy against crimes. We must be so tolerant that only vile criminals would think we stand for anything other than peace and tolerance. Our system of laws must be so lax that there is no doubt that criminals are bad people, indeed under totalibertarianism there will be no accusations that acceptable behaviors are criminalized and therefore any claim of oppression will be unfounded. Indeed, people will not claim that we are oppressive but rather that we are too tolerant! This is the contrast between classical totalitarianism and totalibertarianism, in a classical totalitarian society the claim is that the powers are extremely oppressive, in Totalibertarianism they will claim that our tolerance is too great!<br /><br />We must have only Totalibertarians in power. We can have a dictator, but it is better to have a council to prevent one of the dictators from straying from Totalibertarianism. There can even be different political parties that have power and their own forces, but they all need to be Totalibertarians ideologically and all must recognize their moral obligation to squash and power that forms and is not Totalibertarian, and to squash any of the factions of Totalibertarianism that stray from the ideology. <br /><br />Secret police and violence are fine, and indeed our enemies must be treated ruthlessly. Anybody who strays from Totalibertarianism is a criminal and probably a terrorist or slave trader at that, and they need to be dealt with violently and harshly. Again, nobody can complain if they are doing nothing wrong, no ideology on earth is as tolerant as Totalibertarianism. No person on earth will say that we are violent to people who do not deserve violence, rather they will claim that we are not violent to people who they think we should be violent to! <br /><br />A monopoly on weapons is not acceptable, people need to be free to have weapons, although it is debatable if we should let non totalibertarians have access to nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Certainly the people have a right to guns and general weapons though.<br /><br />A monopoly on the means of communication is not acceptable, and this is one of the areas where Totalibertarianism differs from classical totalitarianism.<br /><br />Central direction and control of the economy is a must! The totalibertarian forces must ensure that the economy remains free from taxation, free from oppression, etc. So although we must maintain total control of the economy, we will use this control only to ensure that the economy remains free.

Under the rule of Totalibertarians you are free to form a body where representatives of the many go to decide what the many will do communally! But it must be voluntary.

And you cannot have what the many decides upon be binding onto the few who do not choose to join the organization. For example, you can have a community school still, and you can pay taxes to the people running it. But you cannot force somebody who does not want to use the service to pay for it, so you cannot tax them or require them to join your organization. Totalibertarians are extremely tolerant of those who wish to organize in whatever way they see fit, indeed we are accepting of communists and of free market capitalists! However, the default position of all people is free market capitalism, and we will protect those who do not wish to join communist structures. So you can have your commune and those who decide to join it can live under the rules they have agreed upon. But those who do not wish to join cannot be forced to, and their default status is Free Market Capitalism. They can only lose their default status by voluntary agreement.&nbsp; <br /><br />But you are correct in that Totalibertarians dream of a world where we violently rip freedom and choice away from the many. Their freedom to kill, to rob, and to enslave will be viciously ripped from them. They will have no choice at all in the matter!

If you do so you are a dissident and must be ruthlessly crushed like a bug. Additionally, you cannot force your neighbor to be thrown into a volcano to please your God, as doing so would make you a dissident and an enemy of the Worlds Totalibertarian Liberation Army.

				The only way to accomplish it is for enough people to join the Worlds Totalibertarian Liberation Army, and for us to amass enough weapons to beat the armies of the world into submission. <br /><br />Of course it would be more beneficial for us to not engage in traditional warfare. Rather, targeted assassinations and attacks without fronts forming. The worlds political structures can be taken advantage of as well, to gradually make our way toward Totalibertarianism. For example, consistently kill the political leaders who are most against us, and it becomes artificial selection. Is a certain political organization consisting of 50% people who are 100% against freedom and 50% people who are 90% against freedom? Kill the 50% who are most against freedom, and hope that their replacements are more for freedom. After doing this long enough maybe we can cause the balance to lean more and more toward freedom, up to the point that the political organization voluntarily embraces Totalibertarianism. There is actually no point for us to take on armies, armies are there largely to form a front that an attacking force needs to get past in order to target the politicians and other powerful members of a country. But Totalibertarians are already spread through out the world, and we can spread our ideology to others through the internet and try to convert more members to our cause. We have no need to try to push back a front, we have mini-fronts all over the place, every man can be his own front. <br /><br />Then we can get the armies of nations to submit to us without even actually fighting with them. Once we take over the political structures we effectively take over the armies they control. Then we can use the armies to further our cause, if required, on our path to global domination.

I know I sure as hell will not. Why should I pay for schools that I don&#039;t go to, or pay to use roads that I don&#039;t use, or pay to fund the police that I disagree with? I would rather pay to go to school where I want to, and pay to use the roads I want to, and pay the police who I agree with. I am not so dumb that I cannot select what I want to fund myself, I sure as hell don&#039;t need armed men with guns to take my money and spend it on what they see fit. <br /><br />WTLA recognizes that many of the rich people today are only rich at the expense of others. A prime example of this would be all drug enforcement agents. Now of course we would immediately fire all such people, but if they can keep their ill gotten gains is another question. I would personally be in favor of seizing all of their assets, as all the money they have is from kidnapping, slavery, and extortion. As far as owners of companies and such, in many cases they rightfully have those things. You are not born into life promised a means of production or promised a factory or promised a big chunk of land. However, you have the right to not be extorted by others, by your very nature of being a human! So you will not be taxed at all, and can spend your money however you want as well.<br /><br />It is just not realistic for us to go through out all of human history and look at the events that caused certain people to have money today, and see if they got their money from wrong deeds, so that we can seize it and give it to the people they wronged. We cannot say that oh some white people are only rich today because their great great great great grandparents owned slaves and got rich off of their labor, so let us take their money and distribute it to the great great great great grandchildren of slaves. Too much history in the world, too many events, too many interpretations, etc, we cannot undo the wrongs of history. <br /><br />To me it sounds like some of you might be be less opposed to the WTLA if we had a final single redistribution of wealth, to try to lessen the impact of the previous wrongs in the world. Maybe good people will have money taken from them as well, but perhaps having a single time fee for the cost of perpetual freedom afterwards is worth it. But the thing is, even this is not really realistic. The world has $231,000,000,000,000 worth of private wealth in it. If we taxed everybody a single time fee of 50% of their money, we would have $115,500,000,000,000. There are like 8,000,000,000 people in the world. That means if we evenly distributed half of the wealth in the world over the entire world, everybody would get $14,437. But then take into account the logistics of doing this, etc, it will end up being much less than that after costs are calculated. Is getting everybody in the world a one time payment of a few thousand dollars really worth all the work it would take? And can we really justify taking 50% of every single persons money and then redistributing it in such a way? On the positive side, some of the people who are only rich because of slavery will lose money that will benefit some people who might only be poor because of slavery. On the other hand, we will be enslaving people who did not get their money in a bad way in the process! So in helping to right the wrongs of the past we are making new wrongs in the present! <br /><br />So it doesn&#039;t seem very realistic to me that we have a final massive wealth redistribution prior to implementing Totalibertarianism. I think it is better to recognize that in the past we allowed bad things to happen, but in the future we do not. People will always benefit from doing bad things in the world, especially when society lets them. But that doesn&#039;t mean we cannot say &quot;Okay, from now on no more evil shit is allowed. The system is fair from now on!&quot;. Sure, some people who have power got it in bad ways. But we can either allow bad things to keep happening to not give them more of an advantage, or we can just stop these bad things from happening all together and hope that over time things correct themselves. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">So me and my redistributive taxation loving comrades will be free to start our more equitable society, as long as we don&#039;t attempt to tresspass on any of THEIR productive agricultural land or attempt to take any of THEIR oil.

Or should we point guns at educated people and make them teach for free? Here is the thing. In a libertarian society, there is indeed likely to be charity. Also, there are so many groups out there that want to brainwash people, that education is not going to be hard to come by. There will be not for profit Catholic schools and similar, where they mix decent education in many areas with dogmatic brainwashing in others. Also, in modern times, a person is able to teach themselves via the internet, at least to a very large extent. Centralized institutions of learning are dying a slow and painful death, the primary reason we need them is because people who hire for jobs like to see that people have a degree. In the future I hope we move more toward hiring based on merit instead of degree, with certifications and such, so self taught people are not at a disadvantage. But that is not up to me or you to decide, it is up to the people who hire. I can get online and talk to professors, security experts, programming experts, etc, and have them answer my questions. I talk to computer science professors online all the time, and I don&#039;t spend a dime for their advice! I can download things to teach me math, to teach me programming, to teach me history or a foreign language. On the internet there is a massive community that trades in knowledge, with more knowledgeable people teaching less knowledgeable people, all the way down to the total noobs. So if someone cannot afford to go to school, they can still become very educated if they can at least manage to get onto the internet. Also, people can work to make money for school! My parents were not rich when they were growing up, indeed they were pretty poor. And they still put themselves all the way through university, all the way to advanced degrees, all the way to making fuck tons of money. I have several friends with parents who have similar stories, either putting themselves through college and getting advanced degrees, or starting their own businesses and becoming millionaires in some cases. The people I know IRL are largely from families that demonstrate the fact that the economic ladder can be climbed, a lot of them went from broke to rich through hard work. <br /><br />And then you want to punish people like this! People who worked hard to be able to move from little money to rich, you want to then take money from them and give it to other people so that they don&#039;t need to work as hard to do the same thing. So essentially you support slavery, because you want the hard work of some to benefit others, when the others have done nothing to benefit those who worked hard!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">who have to drive in the slow, cheaper lane while the rich drive past in the express lane<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So instead we should what, point guns at the rich people and take their money so the poor people can afford to drive in the express lane? Maybe the poor people can work their way up to being able to own the damn express lane! It will be much easier when we abolish government regulations and laws! Think of all the business that is prevented by the government. What if some poor person wants to start a Bitcoin exchange? Hah, good luck doing that in USA, you would need so much money to hire lawyers and such to make sure you don&#039;t break the law, and even then you would probably go to prison. In a libertarian society, we don&#039;t give a fuck if you know your customers! You don&#039;t need to keep records, you are not going to run afoul of the law because we simply don&#039;t give a shit what you do, so long as you are not directly hurting others against their will. If you want to go out on the corner and sell crack, have at it! Want to be a prostitute? Go right ahead! One of the biggest reasons why many poor people are in perpetual poverty is because of things like the war on drugs, all things that we will abolish in a libertarian society. *EVERYBODY* will win in a libertarian world, the only people who will lose are the people who are currently exploiting everybody else! Maybe the rich have the most to gain in some ways, but trust me the poor have a lot to gain as well. How many drug prisoners do you think are poor people? All of them will be freed and then they can support their families. How many murders do you think are linked to the war on drugs? How much crime do you think is linked to the war on drugs? In a libertarian society, the communities that have been ravished by these things will see immediate improvements. Gang violence will drop over night, the cartels will be bankrupt, etc. Hundreds of thousands of people who are in prison not so much because they are drug users but rather because they are poor drug users, will be free!&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">and whos rights the police ignore because they haven&#039;t paid&nbsp; their subscription? <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is why we need to WTLA. Because we need to make sure that everybody has their rights protected. Anybody who violates the rights of another is acting against libertarianism, and therefore they are dissidents and enemies. Remember that we are totalitarian in our approach, we are not going to tolerate any dissidents what-so-ever. People who do not stick to the &#039;party&#039; line must be swiftly and harshly dealt with. Sure, we can have other police agencies that people pay for protection. But at the end of the day we need to make sure that all dissidents are crushed like bugs. Maybe the answer is not Anarchy after all, with its decentralized private police agencies. Maybe the answer is a single body movement, a benevolent dictatorship. But there is no reason why only one person should be in control. Anybody who respects rights will be acting in the name of Totalibertarianism when they stop those who violate rights. So when it comes to action we can be and probably indeed must be decentralized, but when it comes to ideology we must be totally centralized. We can have the World Totalitarian Liberation Army and the World Totalibertarian Front, and they can have different leaders and members, but if any of them stray from the ideology of Totalibertarianism then they must be seen as the terrorist organization that they will have become, and crushed. By decentralizing the power we can prevent a single dictator from going against totalibertarianism, as the others will crush him like a bug, but we must ensure that only Totalibertarians are in power.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I particularly like the idea of paying for police I agree with...!

				Another thing I have become convinced of is that there should be no notion of intellectual property. Ideas and information are things that cannot be owned, and the WTLA must enforce this as well. Not only will this be good for poor people and business start ups, but it will be good for all of humanity as well. It does not hurt those who create when we abolish the concept of intellectual property, they just need to switch to more modern models of production. For example, some say that if we say that anyone can copy a book, that the people who produce books will go out of business. But there are even models for these people, they can do something like Kickstarter and say they will not write their next book until a certain amount of money is sent to them. The model for these people needs to turn into one of pay to produce rather than pay for production. Because if you have a copy of a book and you own it, and you have a blank book, it is totally unacceptable to say that you are not allowed to make a copy of the book you own in the blank book you own. Totalibertarians are totally for peoples right to use their property as they see fit, and this idea just does not mesh well with intellectual property. And it does not hurt the book writers and others, they just need to switch to more modern models.<br /><br />By abolishing intellectual monopolies we will cause many good things to happen, and it will hurt the unfair stranglehold that many established corporations have on their fields. This will be good for poorer people and business start ups, and it will not be bad for producers. The only people who will be harmed by this are those who think they can hold a claim to information. In Totalibertarianism, all information is indeed free, and nobody can claim to own an idea.

You sound like you might be a little bit racist against white people, I note that every single type of person has been exploited other than the devil whites, who all got filthy rich exploiting the others. Do you think that Africans used to have flight technology and live in a super technologically advanced society, before the white people came and robbed it all from them? I am just curious because I often find that people who talk like you believe in revisionist history. <br /><br />PS: You are not ASKING anybody to do anything. Asking implies that you can be turned down. So why not just be honest and say POINTING GUNS AT AND DEMANDING. And it is not their fair share. How is it that someone owes money to the good of the collective? That sounds absolutely absurd doesn&#039;t it? Do you happen to be a communist?

				Aah fuck it I&#039;m convinced.... it was the crushing like bugs that swung it for me. Where can I sign up for the WTLA? I don&#039;t have much to offer but I am willing to obey orders. :-)<br /><br />Totally with you on the intellectual property thing by the way. Fifty years ago the ability to make copies of music required a vinyl pressing factory, and record companies were able to charge huge sums for copies of music. Now technology has moved on and the ability to copy music etc no longer has any monetary value. And yet these intellectual property squatters are still trying to excerpt a stranglehold on this ability. Yes there needs to be some way of ensuring inventors and creators have incentive to do so, but over the years protection of intellectual property has got way out of hand.

				Here&#039;s an interesting question for some of our more enthusiastic Libertarians.&nbsp; <br /><br />If everyone in the world decided tomorrow, that Libertarianism was the way to go and all governments were suddenly Libertarian world-wide...how would we decide who gets what the next day?&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean let&#039;s face it up to this point in history most of the rich people got their wealth through collusion with big governments right (I believe that&#039;s one of the criticisms of the current societal arrangements right)?&nbsp; Also others &quot;stole&quot; the land (or their families did a few generations back) from people like Native Americans, or others.&nbsp; It was litterally taken by force.&nbsp; Shouldn&#039;t we correct these injustices?&nbsp; <br /><br />Or would those robbers and theives get away with it?<br /><br />In other words, who would decide whom has the most legitimate claim to a specific property?&nbsp; Who would for example get the National Parks (can&#039;t leave this stuff in the hands of government right)?<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />R.

I don&#039;t think that anyone here believes (me included) that a libertarian way of life could somehow be instituted out of the blue or done through force which is the very opposite of what libertarianism is.<br /><br />There is only one way and really only one way for libertarianism to take hold: collapse.<br /><br />Let me say that again so you get me: COLLAPSE.<br /><br />That means collapse of the dollar to start. Collapse of the monopoly and absolute power of the federal reserve and the government to force people to use the dollar and other state-sponsored currencies. Collapse of the ability of government to collect income tax. Collapse of the ability of government to print unlimited amounts of debt on the backs of the people. Collapse of the ability of government to partner up with corporations because they&#039;re just too small to do it anymore. And collapse of government period.<br /><br />The current state of affairs is driven by a devastating series of events which happened nearly 100 years ago. And they all happened one after another over a short span of time: creation of the federal reserve, creation of the income tax, creation of the first food and drugs act, exacting heavy penalties for &quot;treason&quot; against the government, and of course the prohibition of drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />A protestant religious movement seized control of policy in America back then. They were obsessed with central planning and making sure that &quot;you are your brother&#039;s keeper&quot; no matter the cost. The masses were considered either too stupid, too weak or too poor to think and act for themselves and therefore needed government to take care of them. They thought that laws made men good and oversaw the largest expansion of government ever up to that point. It didn&#039;t help that the eugenics movement was still in full swing, racism was very high and many forms of socialism were sweeping across the entire globe at the time.<br /><br />The government&#039;s REAL power is derived from only two of those things: the ability to collect income tax through any means necessary and to issue debt through the private federal reserve central bank backed by the income tax. Nearly unlimited amounts of debt since the money supply is grossly distorted through this process and the government can do pretty much anything to get its money. The income tax is the basis for our modern surveillance state and money laundering laws. The thing is that I did say &quot;nearly&quot; unlimited and not just unlimited since NOTHING is unlimited and a collapse will follow. The only question is when.<br /><br />I give it another 7 or 8 years. Definitely less than a decade. The economy will collapse along with the dollar. The size of government will reach a certain breaking point and will implode when it loses the ability to collect income tax. Default will follow. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be part of the mechanism which makes this possible.<br /><br />I know you may not want to hear it but everything is governed by cycles and natural law and government WILL become a lot smaller after growing to an unimaginable nightmarish size. You can&#039;t stop it. You just have to adapt to it. Make your own decisions, think your own thoughts and help yourself and your own family and friends instead of expecting others to do all this for you. You have some time to think about this stuff. Just don&#039;t say that no one warned you when it comes. Detroit is only the beginning.<br /><br />

				Yes Reason that what we have been debating , do try and keep up :-). I have pointed out that since most of the worlds wealth and land lies in private hands already, to institute an extreme&nbsp; lassiez faire free market at this point would be free in name only, as certain players would begin with huge insurmountable advantages<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The response has been that it would be difficult to the point of absurdity to try and restore all wealth and property to its &#039;rightful&#039; owners after analyzing the whole historical proceses that led to these inequalities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To which I reply well thats not really for me to sort out is it? I am not the one proposing we abolish all checks and safeguards painstakingly clawed back from capitalism over the previous two centuries, and so I can hardly be expected to propose ways we can fix the system that libertarians wish to break.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have long pointed out that the distribution of the worlds wealth&nbsp; is a difficult problem for advocates of libertarianism. It doesn&#039;t seem right that we begin a system of&nbsp; free and&nbsp; voluntary exchange where some of the actors possess most of the goods to be exchanged.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Libertarians tend to have recourse to &#039;rising tide lifts all boats,&#039; type argument at this point. And anyway, they say, we are getting away from the main point, which is &#039;is it fair for men with guns to take our money to give to poor?&#039; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But under libertarianism what is to stop men with guns doing whatever they want, if they are backed by sufficiently large corporations? Oh yes, the stormtroopers of the TWLA, who appear to be unelected and answer only to their own extreme definition of liberty.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Picture the future, where increased automation has done away with the need for much of the work force in agriculture and manufacturing. Under an extreme free market that vast number of no longer needed workers will presumably be allowed to starve, in the midst of plenty. Our technology could allow us to produce all neccessitys of life for much less labour and yet this would only less to mass unemployment. The market is not infallible.

However the owner of the shovel will only pay wages to one man to operate it. So although this wondrous invention has created unimaniginabe plenty, it all belongs to the shovel owner. And why in earth should he let people eat his food, or live in his houses for free? So all the wonderful wealth created by this new technology remains in the hands of the owners of the means of production, while the workers who are now surplus to requirements must either be done away with, or some excuse be found to imprison them. THIS is where drug prohibition and the prison industry comes into play. The surplus workers who drift into drug supply and consumption to fill the void left by the automation and third world outsourcing of industry can now be declared criminal and locked up in huge numbers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So an alternative viewpoint is that the Capitalist desire to reduce labour costs has left an inconvenient excess working class which has fueled drug prohibition as a means of disposing of these surplus workers<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Yes, and its difficult to see how the market will resolve this. To be honest libertarianism seems to be a lot of soft spots strung together by the sturdy thread of &#039;why should men with guns take my money and spend it on what they want&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which I freely confess IS a fairly solid argument:. This is indeed what will happen if you disobey the state, in the end. Our modern societies reserve the use of violence to the state and the state alone.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To understand why this is a good thing you need to study history. Humans have risen to their predominant position on this planet by being the most organised ruthless violent apes ever seen. Our history is a gigantic mound of smashed skulls and enslaved women and children.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Slowly we have brought this violence under some limited control. Every one of is still the great great great great great great...........great descendent of the people who were successful at violently out competing their fellows. But we have brought our impulses to use violence to resolve disputes under control. It is still there, for when other means fail.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The states monopoly on violence is part of this. With a strong central state offering dispute resolution (begun in England by Henry II and his concept of the Kings Peace, the birth of the common law, which judges did not decree but discover from the customs of their predecessors) it became less and less necessary for individualk to resort to violence to settle disputes.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The culture of honour, where men were socially expected to avenge any slight with violence, was usually found in areas where no central authority existed, or was weak or distant.

As you say, that was the past. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In two books, The Better angels of our Nature by Steven Pinker and The World until Yesterday by Jared Diamond both authors point out that in primitive societies with no central authority death by violence for an individual is much more common than in modern central state societies.

				Just to add. The horrific events of the twentieth century were not carried out by states. They were carried out by people. People are perfectly capable of self organising into huge genocidal armies and slaughtering each other in huge numbers of their own volition. In fact you could argue that the huge central states grew out of the wars rather than the other way about. Pre 20th century states were much more like commercial empires than modern nation states, with much lower taxation. The end of the Victorian age was in many ways a libertarian free for all, with private companies fighting private wars over the commercially founded colonies of Africa , South America and India. Think of the Hudson bay company, the Dutch east India compoany, and the English east India company. Think &#039;Heart of Darkness&#039; and the Belgian Congo.

				I will need to clarify the above post but it is late and I must go to bed. I am not saying the 2nd world war was a spontaneous endeavour of the people of the world, rather that the activities of untrammelled empire capitalism in the previous century led to the huge armed conflicts, which then necessitated the organising of states into centralised leviathans for the effective fighting of these wars. The wars created the states, the states did not create the wars.

They are both highly social, and have complex (political) communities of interaction within the tribes they inhabit, with strict rules for behavior.&nbsp; There the similarity ends, as they organize socially very differenty. <br /><br />The chimps&nbsp; are highly combative and violent.&nbsp; They organize raids against neighboring tribes, and brutally suppress inner tribe law-breakers or those challenging the existing power structures.&nbsp; The tribes are run by male apes, with females having a seperate but subbordinate structure.<br /><br />The Bonobos are surprisingly very different&nbsp; The most ineresting is that they are matriarchical, or put simply...the females run the show.&nbsp; The Bonobos essentially have a sex based social structure, meaning that it is a complex exchange of sexual favors.&nbsp; The males are kept in check by using sex to direct their behavior.&nbsp; The pecking order of the females is also controlled through female bonobos grooming each other and sowing favor.&nbsp; She who has the most favor rules.&nbsp; This not to say that the Bonobos are violence free, not even close...but it is far less frequent.<br /><br />I believe both of these examples provide us some keen insights about how human beings naturally organize ourselves.&nbsp; Firslty, we do that...organize ourselves and work together.&nbsp; <br /><br />The apes both have heirarchical power structures that allow majority rule (through the social establishment of authority) and minority rights (both tribes have pockets of disenfranchised, but tolerance is the norm for these...although it&#039;s no fun for them).&nbsp; We do this too.&nbsp; <br /><br />Both have forms of wealth redistribution too, the leaders almost always decide whom gets what...however if the leaders aren&#039;t fair...they don&#039;t last long as the lower echelon apes eventually get together and kick their asses.&nbsp; You can only govern with the consent of the governed.&nbsp; Just like us.<br /><br />What to me is key is that neither of these apes ever live alone, outside the tribes.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because they die.&nbsp; The ape tribes evolved to help these creatures survive.&nbsp; When the tribes are strong and socially healthy they do survive.&nbsp; <br /><br />So this tells me that our nature is to organize into heirarchical social structures where both aggression and sexual-social political savviness play a key role in how well we individually fare.&nbsp; We naturally lean toward social organization that allows an elite class to rule, but are allowed to do so only when the lower classes are treated fairly. <br /><br />So is our natural political structure mostly Libertarian?<br /><br />I don&#039;t think so, mostly because the lower classes must be treated fairly and get a piece of the pie (even if they don&#039;t necessarily deserve it in the eyes of the bakers)<br /><br />R.<br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve been reading back over reasons posts to see where he suggests we should base our societies on apes, but I can&#039;t find it. I can find a point where he describes the different ways in which our closest relatives organise their societies, but nowhere where he suggests we should model ourselves on therm.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Incidentally, reason, in answer to a question you put.<br />: humans are exactly equally related to chimpanzees and bonobos. The ancestral line of chimp/bonobo split off from ours and then split into chimps and bonobos, thus we are considered to be equally related, while they are closer to each other than they are to us. All three of us are more closely related to each other than gorillas (branched off earlier) orang utans (even earlier) and gibbons and siamangs(branched off still earlier). Thus we are rightly considered the third chimpanzee, although we have changed a lot further in the 8million years since we parted.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bonobos do indeed use sex for more or less every social interaction. Men fuck men women fuck women and both fuck children. But its like when a dog mounts another male dog, it isn&#039;t about sex its about dominance an hierarchy. Bonobos use it in a more nonconfrontational way to seal bonds within the group.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; None of which suggests that we should adopt bonobo behaviour, anymore than we should strip off our clothes and go live in trees.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And nowhere did Reason suggest such an absurdity.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, chimps engage in genocidal warfare against other tribes. In a famous study of the Goodall chimps, there were two roughly evenly matched tribes, one of maybe 12 one of 9, occupying neighbouring territories. Over several years the larger group killed members of the smaller group in ambushes, beating and tearing isolated individuasls to death, until the smaller group was wiped out and its breeding age females and territory absorbed into the larger group. They then came under attack from an even larger tribe and the warfare continued.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chimps are crap at war when compared with primitive men however. Throughout most of prehistory men lived in small hunter bands, in a state of ferocious war with their nearst neighbours. Strangers could either be traded with cautiously (if parity of numbers in encounter) or killed on sight, just to be on safe side......<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I haven&#039;t really the time or inclination to go through human history and explain how we developed more and more centralised power structures, with both benefits and disadvantages, culminating in the central state.&nbsp; I worry we would be foolish to cast it down without serious thought&nbsp; of what we will put in its place.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I must admit I would love to see a large island established as an experimental libertarian society. Perhasps if antartica becomes ice free and the coastal regions more temperate?

Oh you said deftly I thought you said daftly, never mind. I don&#039;t understand why you think humans, with our great intellects, should base our social structures on fucking apes, lol. I think when you first became a libertarian it was after reading the fountain head, and now you have just read Tarzan and changed your mind. Seriously, apes fling their shit around and have sex with infants, do you really think we should use them as a basis of how to arrange our social structures? There is no legitimacy at all to the claim &quot;Apes are not organized as libertarians, and therefore humans should not be!&quot; , and using that as your arguement just seems absurd.

				&nbsp;I don&#039;t think you are reading our posts anymore&nbsp; kmfkewn, just scanning for phrases you can grotesquely distort and use to mock what you thought we were saying. We both at several points definitely said that ape societies should not be taken as models for human societies, just that it was interesting to compare the methods the other two chimpanzees use to resolve disputes to our much more elaborate rituals and institutions. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The third Chimpanzee has evolved so far from its cousi<br />ns and advanced in so many ways that its difficult to compare us to any other animal. We have truly developed ino something unique under the sun.....no I cant help it, I&#039;m going to have to play the Dane:<br /><br /><br /><br />Hamlet:<br />What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how<br />infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and<br />admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like<br />a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and yet,<br />to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me—<br />nor woman neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.<br /><br />Rosencrantz:<br />My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When debating, I like to engage in a process of synthesis (makes annoying finger meshing gesture). We listen to each others ideas and try and see if we can make some common ground. I believe this is properly known as &quot;a socialist circle jerk&quot;. In your last few posts you are basically putting on a spastic voice and going &quot;Durr so you think we should all just hang around in trees fucking infants and flinging shit? &quot;While I was glad you were able to shoehorn in your paedophilia motif this wasn&#039;t what we were saying.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The chimp and bonobo stuff was kind of a sidebranch to the point I was trying to make about the long millennia of human societal development. From our encounters with stone age people when the New World was recontacted, to more recent encounters with the natives of the Papau New Guinea highlands, (uncontacted until planes flew overhead during WWII, discovering that what had seemed a central massif of steep impenetrable jungle covered mountains had a central plateau of heavily populated agricultural land isolated from the rest of he world for tens of thousands of years,) we know that for most of that time our ancestors lived in small tribes of hunters and simple agriculturists, who coexisted with their neighbouring tribes in a permanent state of either war or uneasy truce, maintained only by careful observation of the social rituals they had developed as alternatives to violence.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the years since Ur,and Surmeria, and the Incas and the Maya, who were among the first to establish central tax collecting governments, and offer codifications of law and courts of judgement as an alternative to violence between disputants as a means to dispute resolution. (When individuals settle disputes over land or property by violence it is easy for it to escalate to include their kin and tribes and allys), our societies have incrementaly developed into larger and more centralised states. I make no moral judgement on this, this is just the way history has tended.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually we end up with our modern system with well its many flaws. In the course of our debate I have reiterated one of my main criticisms of libertarianism: the &#039;how do we get there from here&#039; problem. Since most of the land and wealth of the world is in private hands, if we begin a completely unregulated free market, what is to prevent the have nots and their children from ending up working for and paying rent to that haves., and that being so, how will this society be more free?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your immediate response was to suggest that that was for me to sort out, and that it would be absurd to try and restore everything in history to its &#039;rightful owners&#039; (a process i certainly never advocated. This seems to be a favoured rhetorical technique of libertarians: ignore the actual argument, and instead point out the absurdity of what you IMAGINE was being proposed)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next come the (I hope facetious) suggestion that the transition might be accomplices by the formation oof the World Total Libertarian Army. Something that many would be revolutionaries have learned to there cost is that forming large bodies of armed men, and showing them how easy it is to alter society, rarely ends well. The New Model Army, and the Peoples Dictatorship of Marxist thought spring to mind.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But of course, the WTLA will be different, the only dissidents it will summarily execute will be those who are trying to interfere with anyone elses freedom. But who will make these judgements? Who decides whose freedom trumps whos? Obviously my freedom not to be robbed beats your freedom to be a bandit. But what about where my freedom to fish in a river conflicts with your freedom to divert it to hydroelectric power?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I say our current system is a deeply flawed uneasy&nbsp; balance between Leviathan states that since 1945 have been slowly withdrawing their many tentacles, and the increasing power of agglomerating monopoly capitalism Capitalism has wrought wonders and clearly become the de facto system of the world. I have no problem with that, however the States use of redistributive taxation alleviates some of the worse side effects of capitalism.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During the cold war there was to some extent a beauty contest between east sand west. The west wanted to demonstrate the superior lifestyles enjoyed by its citizens and so used some of the huge wealth generated bytheir superior economic system to provide comfortable living for the lowest paid workers, <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now the threat of an alternative has been removed, the western democracys have slowly been removing the rights and privileges afforded their workers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have to finish now as busy, but I&#039;d like to finish with a quote from Winston Churchill, a man I admire very much, despite disagreeing with much of his politics: <br /><br /><br />Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.&quot; (from a House of Commons speech on Nov. 11, 1947)<br />

People of all races are marrying, and having children with multiple backgrounds, which is in no way a bad thing. But to abandon a great ideology such as libertarianism, because of blacks is nothing short of foolish. Many modern day blacks are beginning to realize that libertarianism is the answer, not the problem.

				The only question that libertarianism is the answer to is &quot;what superficially appealing philosophy doesn&#039;t hold up well under any kind of intense scrutiny&quot;<br /><br />I think libertarianism would be equally disastrous for all poor, landless folk, not just inner city black people. Unless you believe that capitalism, emancipated from the chains of state regulation would generate the legendary tide that lifts all boats. Companies would actually compete with each other to pay workers more, and the virtuous cycle of increased wages would lead to ever increasing wealth and technical development, and we could all afford crime, health, fire and road insurance and utility bills, that the magic of competition had driven to all time lows.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then I woke up to the sound of gunfire , and put my credit card in the slot to turn the lights on. I rang up a few security companys to see which had the lowest call out fee (not being able to afford a general package) and in the end got back into bed. My 12 hour shift at the assembly line began soon and&nbsp; I wanted to get back to that dream I was having about a country that had a welfare safety net and universal healthcare and free education.

Everybody gets something in libertarianism. The rich people get freedom from taxation and the poor people get freedom from prosecution for victimless crimes. Sure, there should be no laws against discrimination. If people don&#039;t like discrimination they wont buy products from companies that are known to discriminate, etc. The market can deal with issues like this very well. <br /><br />Black people tend to be more anarcho-socialist than anarcho-capitalist though.

Anarcho capitalism doesn&#039;t play favorites for any race or socioeconomic status, it blindly grants freedom to everybody. I am sure there are some black libertarians though, hell there are black republicans. So it isn&#039;t so much a race issue but really more of a socioeconomic issue. Poor people largely are not gonna want to be told they cannot steal from the rich. But it doesn&#039;t matter, cuz totalibertarians are not going to let them steal from the rich any more than they are going to let the rich build prison empires filled with poor people

				I mean, I think we can all agree that prohibition is an outrage and besides a huge waste of time and resources that actually makes the problem its meant to solve worse.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But that doesn&#039;t mean that all laws and police enforcement of them is trampling on our freedom.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are always going to be murderers and rapists and people with no compunction about using violence to achieve their aims, as all of these traits were positively selected for during our long evolution.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem of how to deal with them is a vexed one. It is very difficult to envision how to restrain violent individuals without using violence ourselves.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That being said I had rather the authority to administer that violence rest in as few hands as possible, ideally a police force that is notionally independent, and funded by taxation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I say our current system is deeply flawed, but at least is formed around ideas of democracy, ie if we dislike our leaders we can replace them with another set of equally unpleasant characters.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would be happy to discuss ideas related to more local self determination and government, so that communities can decide for themselves what system they wish to live under. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				I think a lot of our problems in this&nbsp; thread could be better solved if there were still uninhabited virgin land where you could go and live as you please. I think a lot of this strain of political thought comes from the history of the US The early colonists were much impressed by the freedom promoting laws of the Haudensaunee confederation (more popularly known as the Iroquois, Mik&#039;maq, Abeneki, Choctaw, and I can&#039;t remember the others) who were popularly called the &quot;five civilised tribes&quot; who inhabited new england (the Dawnland) before Europeans arrived. The Indians held the Europeans in contempt for always defering to some remote authority such as a governor or king (I can&#039;t find the great quote that describes this in 1491 by Charles Mann, a book I recommend you read if you haven&#039;t already, as it will change how you think of precolumbian America)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Later, when most of the Indians(I use this term as widely accepted) had been wiped out by disease and the only survivors were the nomadic and understandably hostile horse tribes of the plains, the new Americans grew to think of the continent as largely uninhabited and open to settlement. This ability to &#039;go west&#039; and start your own affair had an inflationary effect on wages in the east during the pioneer days , as if you weren&#039;t being paid well enough it was always possible to head west and start your own farm.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel that this history has had a huge effect on american political thought and the ideas of freedom held dear there. And yet this freedom was built on the back of (mostly accidental) genocide and slavery. History is fascinating.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In John Locke s excellent &quot;Two treatises on government&quot; (after completely demolishing the Divine Right of kings, popular then during the Restoration of Charles II) he talks about the nature of property, and how it is acquired by &#039;mixing labour with the product of nature&#039; so that by working land it becomes ones property. Thus is fine while still unclaimed land remains but becomes more problematic when all land is taken. Since this book was written in mid 1600s it seems remarkably prescient of the concerns that would tax future political thought.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I fondly hope that climate change might make Greenland, and later Antarctica, inhabitable and perhaps colonists there can experiment with new forms of libertarian society!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

				Hungry Ghost what is your fascination with groups of people in close geographic location being forced to behave in the same way? It is a really weird and primitive way to see the world. Why do we need some new land to be opened up for libertarians to all move to? Why can&#039;t we just let people be libertarians where they already are? What is the big difference? You guys can keep paying your taxes, and the people who want to experiment with libertarianism can stop, and only pay for the services that we desire. You guys can keep being arrested for drug crimes, and we can stop and be free to use drugs. There is no magic that happens when a critical mass of people is reached in a certain geographic area. We don&#039;t need our own island. We just need to start having libertarian rules and non-libertarian rules, and let people pick which one they want to be. If you would love to keep being bothered by the police and thrown into prison and extorted for money to fund the very people who oppress you, feel free! But we don&#039;t want to do that, so we shouldn&#039;t. There, now libertarians can be happy and statists can be happy, and we don&#039;t need Antartica to become habitable to satisfy your geographic proximity fetish.

				Roads, other infrastructure, legal system and enforcement. It is not possible for the two systems you describe to share territory. If a dispute arises between a tax payer and a libertarian, to who do they appeal to justice?I&nbsp; can&#039;t envision any society coping with a&nbsp; large&nbsp; group of people deciding they will no longer be subject to its laws, even where some of those laws are clearly wrong.&nbsp; Plus if &#039;my &#039; group were&nbsp; &#039;choosing to pay taxes&#039; then we too would be libertarians, as we would be choosing to pay for services we require. I can&#039;t stress this enough; the system you describe is not libertarians and tax payers coexisting, it is simple libertarianism, and kind of inadvertently makes my point. I hadn&#039;t thought of it as a fetish as in&nbsp; I can only derive sexual arousal from it, and not without, but yes, I do believe its difficult for radically different societies to coexist geographically.See example of Indians/Europeans&nbsp; above.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I get it. Drug prohibition is an outrageous restriction of personal freedom. But using this as the well built base of a flimsy straw man woven to include redistributive taxation and states reserving use of force to itself is not going to scare many crows.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I believe that laws that can imprison me for drug use are wrong, and&nbsp; resent contributing to pay for them. I believe laws that can imprison me for violently assaulting people with knives or guns to be reasonable, if not perfect, and don&#039;t object to funding them.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another way to characterise libertarianism is &#039;everyone pays as much/little &#039;tax&#039; to who/whatever they want. I can see this working very well for the wealthy. The poor will presumably pay no tax at all, however, if supply of labour exceeds demand (usual throughout history, excepting after wars, plagues, andother culls) then wages for&nbsp; the poor will be driven down to subsistence level, leaving them unable to use the insurance based models of health care and&nbsp; sickness pay and justice usually envisioned by libertarians.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The stage will be set for the rise of a new plutocracy of the wealthy, and I cannot see how the market will regulate this, unless sufficient poor die to make their labour more valuable,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I feel outr current system is basically capitalism regulated by government , and I see no reason to remove the regulation and allow capitalism to follow its relentless logic to its merciless conclusion. Unjust drug laws not withstanding

				Capitalism and libertarianism as a part of individualism separates humanity from each other they breed competition and hatred It is a recessive force in action. I waiver on a daily basis whether or not to support libertarianism. The problems I have with it are (like I said above competition leading to no one being able to trust anyone else because who knows your dentist might just say you have a root canal to pay for his new car payment) Also say we enact a libertarian government system. One where there are no wars, no laws against drugs,No borders (I think that is a libertarian value even if it is not it is not core to my argument), No currency regulation , a limited police force and government and no safety net. So I am going to lay out to you many possible ways this system could fail and its flaws: So as much as we all love what the bitcoin does for us it makes us anonymous and we can use it to buy drugs on the silkroad but we must acknowledge it has its shortcomings and those same short comings will be inherent in an unregulated government system as well.Think about why we created regulation it was to break apart the monopoly&#039;s&nbsp; that were taking advantage of the unregulated system and gather all of the wealth leaving none for anyone else&nbsp; (fuck you Regan economics does not work). The same thing will eventually happen with the bitcoin but that is a totally different topic for another day. I see nothing wrong with no war and no drug laws apart from the fact that some people as stated before do need parents to stop them from smoking Heroin and with out any social programs to educate these people who need help they may fall into the lower category but that is just speculation. So on to the other points, What happens when you eliminate a large portion of the taxes,eliminate welfare and social programs and eliminate regulations so that there are no longer minimum wage, no longer any environmental regulations so that companies can pollute and destroy the environment as well as endanger the lower members health&nbsp; all of this keeping the people at the bottom in there place into the bottom rungs of this libertarian society. Not to mention the lack of firefighters and police officer, roads etc. when all of these things are privatized will the people at the bottom be able to afford to use them?? Can we trust the companies making them?What will happen to the lower groups with no safety net, DO you really think all of those human beings are going to just lay down and die. HELL NO! They are going to get up rob,murder steal, Revolt and do whatever they can do to stay alive and prosper. It will come down to whether the upper classes money, power and weapons can over power the lower classes numbers and will to survive. From that point it is any ones guess what will happen next but capitalism and libertarianism I believe on its current course will lead us to have to redefine the phrase &quot;Class Warfare&quot;&nbsp;

				Favourite fact from 1491 by Charles Mann: &#039;Squanto&#039; the friendly English speaking Indian who helped the pilgrims, as I&#039;m sure many US readers will have been taught at school, had been kidnapped by English sailors and sold as a slave in Spain over a decade ago. Having first escaped from Spain to England, from thence working his passage to Maine (1000s of miles of hostile tribes from his Massachusetts home) he eventually persuaded a captain to retutprn him to his home. Only to find the once densely populated coast a graveyard caused by smallpox, with the pilgrims settlement built on the ruins of his village.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He chose the name Tisquantum which in his native tongue meant something like &quot;the rage of the world spirit&quot; or &quot;The wrath of God&quot;. Whatever his intentions in introducing himself to the Pilgrims in such a manner, he obviously had ulterior motives (wanting to use the newcomers to facilitate the recovery of the remnants of his tribe to power)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I love imagining this tine in history.

Not many people are going to care if libertarians use drugs, most of them will never even know it is happening! The main difference is that the police cannot arrest the libertarians for using drugs. The crimes libertarians engage in are all victimless crimes, they are only prosecuted because the police hunt them down, as there is not a victim involved to call the police. Of course, there are many snitches who give intelligence to the police, but they act as an extension of the police and are not victims of libertarians. <br /><br />PS: Silk Road is a large group of people deciding they will no longer be subject to the laws of society. Silk Road is a private defense agency. Look who is winning so far? Are the police and politicians throwing a fit trying to shut SR down? Is SR down? Libertarians are already saying fuck the state, and the private defense agencies that are willing to protect us for a fee are already starting to emerge. In the future the defense agencies will be even more powerful. Hell, look at all the money SR has made, many millions of dollars. If they invested that in running a market for the assassinations of political officials who are for the war on drugs, we would have an entire army of independent soldiers willing to take our fight for freedom to the level of offensive instead of defensive. I don&#039;t think SR has any plans to do this, but in the future there will be offensive defense agencies as well. Defensive defense agencies are willing to use security etc, to protect their customers, for a fee, but if the customers are arrested there is nothing they can do to help them. An offensive defense agency would be willing to do the same things as a defensive one perhaps, but once the customer is arrested the police who arrested them would end up with their brains blown out as well. And the offensive defense agencies are going to be just as effective at telling the state to fuck off as the defensive ones have already proven themselves to be. Make no mistake, the libertarian revolution is already here and the private defense agencies have already risen up to the state and have thus far defeated them without even the need for violence. But to fully defeat them it will likely require violent agencies as well, protecting innocent people from a ruthless attacker is great, but at some point the attacker will hurt one of the innocent people, and the market still demands an agency that will bring justice to the attacker in such cases. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Plus if &#039;my &#039; group were&nbsp; &#039;choosing to pay taxes&#039; then we too would be libertarians, as we would be choosing to pay for services we require.

But the current system is not libertarianism, because people who do not want to pay taxes are being forced to. So the system we have now is not libertarians and statists existing together, it is statists forcing everybody to toe the party line. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I get it. Drug prohibition is an outrageous restriction of personal freedom.

Taxation is outrageous restriction of personal freedom as well. So are laws against people viewing CP. So are laws regarding the regulation of products and medicines. Essentially every single thing the government does is a full on assault against personal freedom. And the government does a lot of things, and it tries to do many more things. Government is a cancer, it will grow and grow up to the point it has killed the host. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I believe that laws that can imprison me for drug use are wrong, and&nbsp; resent contributing to pay for them.

The biggest trick the government has mind fucked you with is the notion that you need to pay for both. Nothing prevents a society where people pay for what they want and don&#039;t pay for what they don&#039;t want, it is called fucking libertarianism. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Another way to characterise libertarianism is &#039;everyone pays as much/little &#039;tax&#039; to who/whatever they want. I can see this working very well for the wealthy. The poor will presumably pay no tax at all, however, if supply of labour exceeds demand (usual throughout history, excepting after wars, plagues, andother culls) then wages for&nbsp; the poor will be driven down to subsistence level, leaving them unable to use the insurance based models of health care and&nbsp; sickness pay and justice usually envisioned by libertarians.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Nothing stops poor people from forming unions or from pooling their money for insurance. First of all, you are wrong.

Unjust drug laws not withstanding<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />How about the poor people join unions and demand certain wages? Why don&#039;t the poor people pool their money to be able to buy group insurance and such? By the way, I wonder if poor people would rather live as poor slaves in prison or be free and poor? Because the current system right now has enslaved the poor more than any libertarian system will. You think there is not a plutocracy right now? Rich people run the world. The difference is that in a libertarian society, even though they still run the world, they cannot enslave others.

				&quot;I can only speak for the welfare state in my country, but the idea of a sizable welfare dependent class is a)largely mythical &quot;<br /><br />Really? Interesting claim. <br /><br />&quot;and b) where real due to whole areas of the country that used to employ huge numbers of workers in mining and heavy industry having been shorn of these sources of employment in a generation or so. This happened as a consequence of, well, many things. Like most historical processes its difficult to identify a single cause. The relaxation of import export tariffs and in general globalisation has meant that much of this industry now takes place in countries where labour costs are lower. &quot;<br /><br />Those industries were unsustainable. Protecting industries and maintaining tariff walls makes your country poorer, not richer. While the there are certainly some losers when protectionist policies are abandoned (those who worked for the protected industries), there are many more winners (those who benefit from cheaper, higher quality goods - everyone, that is). And then there&#039;s the fact that capital is freed up to be applied in sectors of the economy where there is a competitive advantage, as opposed to the government propping up loss-making dinosaurs at the taxpayer&#039;s expense. And as for the government-owned industries - the government shouldn&#039;t be in the business of running businesses. They generally do it really badly. Thatcher was dead right to shut them down/sell them off.<br /><br />&quot;So, when we no longer needed them, should these people have been sterilised and starved? Or should we have used some of our countries wealth to support its citizens?&quot;<br /><br />You mean take money off one group of people and give it to another? I assert that citizens should take care of their own affairs. That is the natural order of things.<br /><br />&quot;As a nation we are still very wealthy, and much of our wealth now is generated by the esoteric activities of The City (London&#039;s financial market).&quot;<br /><br />Yes and your whole country is bankrolled by that &#039;esoteric&#039; activity.<br /><br />&quot;The current government is attempting to portray the large national debt as due to &#039;welfare scroungers&#039; when in fact the vast majority was acquired when we underwrote the huge debts that these financial institutions had mistakenly thought were good investments. &quot;<br /><br />Um no, that&#039;s quite wrong. You were running large budget deficits throughout much of the Blair/Brown era. That&#039;s where your debt came from. Your bank bailouts were relatively modest, particularly in comparison to those of some other countries (ie. Ireland, Iceland)<br /><br />&quot;The government printed money and gave it to banks to avert a national crisis. How is this different from making welfare payments to those who society has failed to provide gainful employment?&quot;<br /><br />I don&#039;t agree with printing money, but that&#039;s a different issue from wealth redistribution. Why is it society&#039;s job to provide employment for people? Seriously, you&#039;re using the language of the far left.<br /><br />&quot; This &#039;welfare scrounger&#039; mythos is propaganda designed to promote the removal of safeguards against exploitation that our forefathers fought hard to gain.&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s hardly a myth. You seriously don&#039;t think there are problems with generational welfare dependency in the UK? Damn. Every developed country has this problem. And what exploitation are you talking about?<br /><br />&quot;These storys of estates where three generations have not worked may be partially true. Do you really believe that this is because they are lazy? Or has our society failed in some way? <br /><br />Partially true? How could that be? The ever-growing client class isn&#039;t lazy as such - it&#039;s just that there is no incentive to work if the government provides everything for you. The state has failed by creating this client class in the first place. And those who had a hand in putting this cradle-to-grave welfare system in place failed, too.<br /><br />&quot;If we were to abandon all forms of welfare protection, what would happen? &quot;<br /><br />People would do what they did before the welfare state. They would work, and rely on family and private networks in difficult times.<br /><br />&quot;Would the market provide work for these idle hands? &quot;<br /><br />Sure, of course it would. It did before. There was life before the welfare state. I&#039;m not suggesting we abolish the welfare state overnight, as that would cause chaos. People have made long term plans based on the assumption that they will receive government benefits at certain point in their lives. A gradual phase-out would be the best way. Unfortunately, this would appear to be politically impossible (people love them some &quot;free stuff&quot; from the government - manna from heaven or something). That doesn&#039;t change the fact that the current, ever-growing welfare state is unsustainable and it eventually will collapse, meaning that a bunch of people will overnight be thrown off their benefits and that will be catastrophic. Far better to have a slow phase-out so that civil society can gradually resume the functions that the state has monopolised over the past 60 years or so. It won&#039;t happen, though. Collapse is far more likely.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But NEWSFLASH: like most things, its a bit more complicated than &#039;the welfare state created the needy&#039;. Were there no needy before the welfare state? Was there much less poverty before the safety net of guaranteed subsistence increased wages to above subsistence levels.?&quot;<br /><br />Newsflash, no it isn&#039;t. The welfare client class is hardly well-off. They&#039;d be better off working, but there is little incentive for them to work. The genuinely needy in wealthy societies are almost always needy due to decisions that they, as adults, need to take responsibility for. I will reiterate the point is that the reason there is less poverty today is because society is wealthier, and that wealth has been created by private enterprise IN SPITE OF government intervention, not because of it. <br /><br />&quot;And in the heady early days of the industrial revolution how were workers treated, before capitalism was moderated by a paternal state?&quot;<br /><br />They were heady days, indeed. Workers during the industrial revolution period were treated much better than pre-industrial revolution workers. The industrial revolution saw enormous and rapid rises in living standards across all levels of society. Moderating capitalism has merely made it less effective at generating wealth. Like I said, our society today is wealthier than before IN SPITE OF state intervention, and would be wealthier if there was little intervention. Free markets are enormously powerful wealth generators and are powerful enough to carry an epic bureaucratic burden, but eventually they will sink under the burden. And in a society where so many people have an expectation that the state will provide for them and care little about the cost because &quot;the government pays for it&quot;, that burden will be ever increasing.

This happened as a consequence of, well, many things. Like most historical processes its difficult to identify a single cause. The relaxation of import export tariffs and in general globalisation has meant that much of this industry now takes place in countries where labour costs are lower. So, when we no longer needed them, should these people have been sterilised and starved? Or should we have used some of our countries wealth to support its citizens?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Think about what you&#039;re saying here. Let&#039;s say the government did exactly as you wanted and dramatically raised trade tariffs (which would be completely against the common market over the past 60+ years and the EU over the past 20). Do you think that more companies or less companies would set up shop in Britain? Serious question. More or fewer companies? And your reasons for thinking this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, its complicated. As a nation we are still very wealthy, and much of our wealth now is generated by the esoteric activities of The City (London&#039;s financial market).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The current government is attempting to portray the large national debt as due to &#039;welfare scroungers&#039; when in fact the vast majority was acquired when we underwrote the huge debts that these financial institutions had mistakenly thought were good investments. The government printed money and gave it to banks to avert a national crisis. How is this different from making welfare payments to those who society has failed to provide gainful employment?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;m impressed! I guess you stumble upon the truth occasionally. You&#039;re right. It is no different. It is redistribution personified. Redistribution is redistribution. Period. This philosophy is backed by theft (taxation and inflation). And debt. Lots and lots of debt. The government grows and snuffs out whatever it doesn&#039;t like (like investigative reporters, whistleblowers and small businesses). The poor are occasionally thrown a few bones while the bankers feast. Welfare is great because it keeps so many people dependent upon government. Keeps the crooked wheels and palms of the state greased. Warfare is great because it does the same. More government. More theft. More taxes. More debt.<br /><br />Remember that a government that&#039;s big enough to give you everything you want is a government that&#039;s also big enough to take away everything you have. The same government that makes it seem like it was behind poverty reduction will turn around and loot the poor and middle class to line the pockets of government&#039;s best patrons. The mega rich. This ruse worked perfectly with the coalition. Weak dog Nick Clegg is the poster boy of a statist and someone who supports redistribution all the way. He was against it before he supported it lol<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Would the market provide work for these idle hands?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Only if a market wage were permitted to exist and trade/creation/production were not regulated by the government. Jobs would start flowing in again like gangbusters.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But NEWSFLASH: like most things, its a bit more complicated than &#039;the welfare state created the needy&#039;. Were there no needy before the welfare state? Was there much less poverty before the safety net of guaranteed subsistence increased wages to above subsistence levels.? And in the heady early days of the industrial revolution how were workers treated, before capitalism was moderated by a paternal state?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Minimum wage was invented to try and cushion people against the ravages of inflation (and also taxation to a lesser degree). Again both are forms of theft. At one point 1 pound would actually buy you 1 real pound of 99% sterling silver. How much will it buy you today?&nbsp; ;)

				&quot;metacontxt, are you aware of the extreme poverty and squalid living conditions which were widespread in slums around the UK during the &#039;heady days&#039; of the industrial revolution?&quot;<br /><br />Of course.

The free market was EXACTLY why the 19th century poor were better off than the poor of the 18th century. To suggest otherwise is Dickensian ahistorical nonsense that socialists/greens tend to subscribe to; ie. the Industrial Revolution came along and packed the peasants off to work in &quot;dark, satanic mills&quot; and endure a life of extreme poverty, as opposed to the happy, bucolic existence they enjoyed prior to the dawn of the industrial age.<br /><br />Throughout history, when free markets flourished, prosperity increased. When constraints were placed on free markets, rates of poverty increased. There are no exceptions to this rule.<br /><br />&quot;who were certainly not lazy.&quot;<br /><br />Strawman. No one was saying they were. They couldn&#039;t be. They would had led utterly miserable lives if they were. And that&#039;s exactly how it should be. No one owes you a living.

				Yes I have read the books you recommend and several more besides. They are full of interesting ideas. I have also read many other books about many subjects. John Locke, Thomas Paine, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Thomas Hobbes, Decline and Fall of Roman Empire. I love to read.&nbsp; Das Kapital. The Condition of the working class in England. I have read many books where I think well that&#039;s one way of looking at things and is true for a certain value of true.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I haven&#039;t achieved much with the life I was given but I have read and read and read. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You appear to think that the dark ages immediately preceded the industrial revolution. You are glossing over nearly 1000 years. In fact men and women during the dark ages were much healthier and taller than the starvling specimens of the early industrial period working class. This is well established from skeletons. However, as I say, nearly 1000 years.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Industrialisation in England began with agriculture, with inventions that increased the productivity of the land, while reducing the numbers of workers needed to work it. At the same time the triangular slave trade began bringing slaves to work the plantations, cotton and other produce to the factories that were springing up in the cities, and finished goods which were sold into Europe and the money used to purchase moire slaves. Also the galleon trade was taking precious metals from the Americas, with incredible impacts on the economies of Asia and Europe. As I say, its complicated.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The cities&nbsp; that grew in the North of England were flooded with economic migrants from the country admittedly drawn by higher wages and enclosure of land for wool farming by landowners (a process began in the medieval period as the feudal system gave way to a mercantile system. Medieval period. Remember?)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, while market innovations hugely increased wealth and prosperity, at the same time there were always more workers than the factories needed, keeping wages low. There was immense poverty in the midst of this newly created wealth. Also slavery was at the core of this wealth production.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The factory hands had very few rights, although I guess you would argue that they entered into voluntary contracts with the mill owners. Previously weavers had been well paid skilled workers but with increased automation and steam power etc. these jobs began to pay less than subsistence wages, forcing children to join the workforce. Again, these children were entering into free contacts with the mill owners. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In many ways the workers were worse off than the slaves. When economic recession hit (the science of economics being in it&#039;s infancy) after various bubbles, the factory owners could say to the workers. &quot;I&#039;m afraid I have no work for you at present and so obviously I cannot be expected to support you in your idleness&quot;. A slave owner at least had an interest in keeping his property in working order. But workers were always replaceable for much less initial outlay.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I didn&#039;t intend this to become a history lesson, although perhaps you might consider boning up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I resent most I think is the false dichotomy of total free market, or total state control of economy.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am fully on board with the free market as the only and best way og determining prices and levels of production. It is not even an ideology, its just what happens when people are left alone to get on with things.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What I don&#039;t get is why, having been so taken with the elegance of the market mechanism, libertarians think &#039;right, that&#039;s it. That&#039;s the final word on human affairs. The only thing that can assure the greatest human happiness is for us just to leave the market be. It is perfect and infallible in its decisions and must not be meddled or tampered with in any way&#039;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why would this be the case? Are things usually this simple? And if the market makes a decision we dislike, can we not just interfere and let the ever flexible market adjust to our ham fisted alterations?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was mentioned that &#039;the esoteric activity&#039; of the City of London (esoteric meaning &#039;hidden, only understood by initiates) supportsthe rest of the country. I never disputed this, but I believe it does so rightly. Both by the wealth it generates, and its contribution to our redustributive tax system. It is right that our society cushions its citizens against sudden changes. That&#039;s part of why society forms in the first place.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think the huge gulf between US and UK thought on these matters stems the from the fact that the US formed from a collection of much smaller colonies and independent polities, over which a federal government slowly excerted greater control, finally explicitly claiming dominance at the time of thecivil war (it is my understanding that States were meant to be able to secede pretty much at will in the constitution).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the UK we have pretty much accepted a hierarchical centralised system and grown with it, from the absolute rule of Plantagenet kings, through the balance of baronial power and Monarchy at Magna Carta, followed by the increased role of Parliament after restoration of Charles II, cemented by the bloodless coup of the Glorious Revolution of 1688. After the intense oppression of the urban poor during early industriasl revolution, the fear inspired by the french revolution caused a relaxation of conditions and&nbsp; introduction of universal suffrage helped secure rights for workers to share in the wealth generated by capitalism and free mnarkets.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then we have the European Apocalypse, the end of the old world. To fight the state controlled totalitarian opponents the UK became a planned economy on a war footing.. Since then the government has slowly released its hold.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The US benefitted hugely from being the last nation standing, and having the huge economic growth engendered by production of materiel without the disadvantage of cities reduced to rubble. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Aah fuck it. Don&#039;t get me wrong, Ron Paul has some interesting ideas. But I just don&#039;t get why we aren&#039;t allowed to interfere with the free market.

Nothing like seeing revolution , even in an unrexpexted quarter, to make the capitalists think &#039;hmmm maybe we had better improve things for our workers &quot; (I am using this language, not because I am a communist. I am not. The hammer and sickle tattoo on my face was a youthful folly I regret. It is just the language of the time)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also huge slaughter of working age men in 1st world war improved the supply vs demand of labour, again forcing&nbsp; concessions from&nbsp; employers.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In general, the history libertarians promote: free markets introduced, great wealth generated is broadly true. But the wealth is concentrated in the hands of the few . Its kind of a tautology that in capitalism the capitalists accumulatethe capital. I expect that sounds really good in German!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wealth is not generally shared until some other force intervenes.<br />I read an article on the Ludwig von Mises site where it was argued that in a free market, the only way a company can flourish is by serving its customers. So that it is the greatest system because the only way the power driven can attain power is by better serving their customers. This is great until you remember that consumers are all often also workers, and so competition to drive down prices of consumer goods also drives down their wages. However:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The model adopted after Great War was to outsource poor to the colonies. Improve conditions for poor in your own country to avert threat of revolution, and keep the workers in the third world colonies. After the 2nd world war a clever tweak was to return self governance to the colonies, while keeping all the good stuff like oil and agricultural land in western companies hands. This is the economic model that persists to this day.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The economist Joseph Stiglitz, one time head of the world bank ,has convincingly argued that forcing free trade on developing countries before they are ready basically allows them to be raped&nbsp; of their resources. Most developing countries primarily produce raw materials which they sell cheaply to western countries who process them into&nbsp; higher value goods. Of course thus is a freely entered into exchange, and the western countries are free to add conditions forbidding the developing countries from , well, developing any competing&nbsp; industries.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The developing countries that have succeeded in most development are those that insist on protectionism for their own industries until they are big and robust enough to play with the big boys (as all western country&#039;s did during their development) Only certain developing countries have the right conditions to perform this defiance though.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The large multinational agriculture and mineral companies that naturally agglomerate under free trade (or maybe they don&#039;t, maybe historical contingency allowed their growth, nevertheless they are here and not going anywhere) can distort free trade to therir own advantage in the way that large governments can.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Chicago school of Milton Friedman and his followers has been very influential . (I am aware that they are not libertarians but they believe in small government and extreme free trade) They have wreaked havoc in South America and other developing regions by leaping in at timess of crisis (usually as emmissaries of the IMF) and insisting on privatisation of all industries and opening up of markets to international capital. This has rarely had the expected beneficial effects.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I understand that the IMF is no doubt anathema to libertarianism. The point I am making is that opening up developing countries to free trade too soon results in asset stripping and currency raids by speculators<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take China. It&#039;s current growth is widely trumpeted as a success&nbsp; of the free market, in fact China has enough clout on the world stage to protect its developing industries until they can compete with more established ones.<br />Well....I have once again spent so long writing this I have totally forgot the crushing arguments I intended to conclude with. Let&#039;s just assume you are totally crushed. I&#039;m OK with it if you are?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My partner always asks me what I&#039;m doing so long on the computer everymmorning. I tell her/him I&#039;m looking at child porn, its easier than explaining that I&#039;m debating libertarianism (which I partly support) on the forum&nbsp; of an illegal online drugs market founded on agorist principles. Its just easier. And they are only images right? I&#039;m not complicit in child abuse if I happen to view them any more than looking at pictures ofthe holocaust makes me a Nazi. The swastika on my other cheek is what makes me a Nazi.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (You realise kmfkewn has left us.? I&#039;m going to miss him. He had this ability to make outrageous arguments and then defend them annoyingly well, but with flaws, that made him a pleasure to debate. Not like you Baraka.. The Dark ages immediately before industrial revolution. Get to fuck. You have disgraced yourself and your country&#039;s education system)

				TL;DR<br /><br />May return to it later. Can see a few howlers already (ie. the Chicago school wrecked South America). But then again sometimes it&#039;s just not worth the bother.

				Like I said before if you believe libertarianism will work. You must believe that we all wish to work for the same reasons and we all wish to work under the free market system of governance and that anyone who doesn&#039;t wish to adhere to that system should simply vanish away... poof. but sadly for your libertarian dreams this does not happen and these people don&#039;t just want to die and vanish away they thrive to survive just as you and I do and when they can not they still do so by all means necessary. Do you really want people breaking in to your house to murder you and steal your food everyday? Do you really want lines of bodies outside of your house demonstrating all of the people you have killed who attempted to rob you? Not all libertarians believe in legalizing drugs what if it is you who is forced to starve would you just vanish away and let yourself die, I think not. Just as is the same with communism when you make one exception you have diverged from the true ideology and are no longer talking about Communism or libertarianism. in reality no one system works completely that is why we have blended and are still blending all of the systems together to see which one works for our inevitably small group of people. Humans are imperfect hence you can&#039;t create a perfect system for imperfect beings&nbsp;

				It&#039;s not is it. I&#039;m spending far too much of my time discussing this. It&#039;s mostly when I&#039;ve just woke up and I&#039;m drinking coffee trying to stop kids fighting. I should get my nose out of the computer and interact with my beautiful children. Fucking technology. Lets me exchange snippy remarks about each others grasp of history and economics with anonymous strangers, while ignoring my children.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think I meant economic thought influenced by the Chicago school, (minimal taxation small state). And to be honest it might of been SE Asia I was thinking of. And I guess libertarians dont agree with the IMF anyway.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking back over the thread I think we can all agree that we are all prone to generalisations, straw men, distirtions of each others arguments, and pronouncing confidently on things we don&#039;t always have all the facts on. <br />I guess I was kind of insulted to be told I don&#039;t know what libertarianism is, having spent a good deal of time reading the works recommended to me by people on this site. I just haven&#039;t found the arguments as convincing as they have. And so I try in my hamfisted way to formulate arguments as to why this might be.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then I see a TL:DR and realise, what the fuck am I doing. Who cares. Maybe if Rand Paul gets elected I will start to care more.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s just the whole &#039;whatever you do Don&#039;t touch the market&#039; idea I don&#039;t get…no I&#039;m off again. Fuck it I&#039;m out of arguments. Just remember, the dark ages were along time before the industrial revolution

				Well, it would seem that this thread has run it&#039;s course, and as I said once before, I apprecaite everyone participating in it.<br /><br />I wondered if somone could persuade me to take up the libertarian banner again, but alas I don&#039;t this that&#039;s happened.&nbsp; <br /><br />I do still really like the libertarian passion for personal freedom and hatred of the drug war, and support for free markets.&nbsp; All things I too am passionate about.<br /><br />As you say though Hungry Ghost, without kmfkewn being here saying crazy but also thought provking things, it does seem a bit lonely.<br /><br />I&#039;ll certainly keep an eye on the thread, and if anyone posts anything just too tempting not to refute...well...it&#039;ll give me reason to return.&nbsp; <br /><br />All the best.<br /><br />R.

				Nah. I just spat my dummy at the &#039;I haven&#039;t really read it but I can see at a glance that you wrong in so many ways&#039;&nbsp; remark. My army of&nbsp; black and white straw men stand poised at top of slippery slope ready to slide into action at any moment. They are soaked in sweet sweet petrol, and all it will take is one spark for me to bring them flaming into action!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Its not quite hemlock time yet.<br />
