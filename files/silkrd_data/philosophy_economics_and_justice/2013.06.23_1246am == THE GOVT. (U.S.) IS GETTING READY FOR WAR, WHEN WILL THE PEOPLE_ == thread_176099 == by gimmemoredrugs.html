				I honestly don&#039;t know what to do about it but wonder what is going to happen to finally cause a change in the way the government lies to us, spies on us, controls us, etc.&nbsp; Basically what I&#039;m doing now is making sure I&#039;m prepared to protect myself and my family if/when shit hits the fan like I hope every sane minded person would also be doing.&nbsp; It&#039;s quite obvious that shit&#039;s gonna get worse before it gets better, it&#039;s just a matter of time of when.&nbsp; We have an advantage over regular internet users because we have this great tool called tor where we can at least organize somewhat and be aware of what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; I&#039;d like to think of myself and everyone else who uses this site as someone who cares about their freedoms, and most importantly protecting those freedoms.&nbsp; This is what the government is suppose to be about yet they do the exact opposite to control a population for one reason, money.&nbsp; The only way it will come to an end is if we the people do something but everyone is too scared of the consequences.&nbsp; So for now, we wait, but we have to be aware everyday of what&#039;s going on.&nbsp; These forums are a great place for discussion with like-minded, intelligent people.&nbsp; Anyway, the main point of this post is to bring light to the article, not for me to preach, because I by no means have it all figured out.

				Well maybe not the USD, but yah, anything else, water, food, clothing, things of value to trade. I know the doomesdayers have been saying it&#039;s coming for a long time now, but it is coming. This method of economy is not sustainable. The powers that be will simply continue to push it to the brink, to the breaking point. Just hope you didn&#039;t somehow end up on some government watch list to be among the first picked up for the government camps. It&#039;s not going to be pretty. Whatever the heck happens the U.S. will never be the same. Most likely it will report to another power. Well it already does, it&#039;s just still somewhat shrouded from our eyes at the present.

				The U.S. government is going fucking crazy and I wouldn&#039;t put a lot of the stuff this article says past them.<br /><br />However, a newspaper that has Newsmax headlines highlighted on every page is a tabloid.&nbsp; Plain and simple.&nbsp; And this story sounds a lot more like fear mongering than anything we should take with even a tiny bit of credibility.<br /><br />But as someone else said, &quot;Cool story bro!&quot;

I recommend a minimum of couple thousand rounds of each plus your personal supply, DO NOT FORGET high quality, high capacity mags also. Magazines are easily damaged and often the cause of problems that people look high and low to diagnose. This is very true of the M16(stoner platform).&nbsp; I&#039;ve had great sucsess with&nbsp; Eric the Ammo man out of New Jersy at CLEARNET LINK&nbsp; www.ammoman.com.&nbsp; free delivery on 1000K&#039;s of pounds of ammo.&nbsp; <br />The other would be&nbsp; tobacco, opiates, benzos, and herb!&nbsp; Seeds are also not the worst idea and a pretty inexpensive way to add some variety to your barter collection. I think poppy, cannabis(for most these should be very hardy landrace strains that can handle stress and do not need much in the way of extra nutrients that may not be available), and food seeds are a good start.&nbsp; <br />Ammo and hi-cap magazines are worth their weight in gold at the right time.&nbsp; Just remember to keep enough for yourself as the old saying goes, ammo is like bubble gum, you gotta bring enough for everyone:-)<br /><br />my .02btc<br />edited for clarity

PERIOD!&nbsp; that may not be as true here on these forums but we are not a good representation of most ameritards.&nbsp; I already see the divisions and have had encounters that remind me of the the US Civil War stories/comments of brothers fighting brothers, fathers and sons etc although at the moment it is in the form of argument not bloodshed. <br />make no mistake, We are cowards, I think the so called &quot;baby boomers&quot; really made it ok to be useless union working sheep and they will continue to. The only ones not so apathetic are the ones in power doing all the damage.&nbsp; &nbsp;For a generation born so close to the Great Depression and the Second WW thay are beyond belief in their collective apathy!&nbsp; For now, I don&#039;t see many risking even a moring coffee let alone voting from the rooftops.&nbsp; War on terror&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; LOST,&nbsp; &nbsp;War on Drugs -&gt; LOST(kinda like Hitler lost, no great consolation for the lives ended or destroyed), <br />&nbsp; WAR on Freedom, The Constitution, andThe Bill of Rights&nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp; Complete 1 sided VICTORY!&nbsp; We suck!&nbsp; We really do. If anyone thinks that the so called 99% that were able to afford to keep their iTrackers on and feed themselves while taking months and weeks from work to protest were of any value, anything more than spoiled young fools and or attention whores I&#039;m interested to hear your reasoning. <br />You ARE NOT BAD OFF when you can pay your expensive cell/data plan while dressing up like a bum and hanging out in NY or any other city.&nbsp; If these are the people we are counting on we&#039;re more fucked than I thought.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ***WAKE UP EVERYONE, THEY DIVIDED AND THEN THEY CONQUERED***&nbsp; <br /><br />at this point I believe even paying your taxes is akin to providing aid and comfort to the enemy.&nbsp; As a LONG time grower and recipient of police abuse(physical, mental, and even sexual!) I&#039;ve felt since my early teens that each penny I paid in taxes was nothing more than my paying for my own and others persecution and punishment for non-violent acts.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				what makes more sense to me: it is the information age. it has taken the place of the arms race.. whichever country gets access to the most personal information of most people in the world will gain dominance presiding over the entire world. that makes more sense to me, rather than some secret orwellian movement to turn us in &quot;proles.&quot;
