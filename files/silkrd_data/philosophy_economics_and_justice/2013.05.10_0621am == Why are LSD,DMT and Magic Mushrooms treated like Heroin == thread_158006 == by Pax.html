				Why is LSD in the same schedule as drugs like Heroin, Meth and Crack(not cocaine). It is non-addictive it is less toxic than sugar and it has medical potential in curing alchoolism,deppression,cluster headaches (and possibly alot more if research was allowed to be done).So why does it have much harsher penalties then drugs like NO2,Morphine and Cocaine(not crack). I love how the US is coming around to Marijuana with a few states even legalizing it completly but even weed has its flaws it is modestly addictive(not nearly as much as some others listed above but still) and if smoked it does have some moderate(comparable to cigs) lung affects.What would be so bad about legalizing Psychedelics?(even just for medical use)&nbsp; why are these Psychedelic drugs that have so much potential treated like evil,toxic and dangerous garbage like heroin(no offense to the Heroin users I realized I may have layed it on a bit heavy there)

				I&#039;m calling bullshit on the &quot;if everybody dropped acid they&#039;d see the truth.&quot;<br /><br />All DEA scheduled drugs not sold by pharmaceutical companies are treated like heroin; there&#039;s nothing particularly special about the tryptamines that makes it so, save for that it once fueled a cultural war against the essence of America (warfare; and it&#039;s not to say that the drug itself induced anti-war ideals, but rather that those who supported acid all wished to rally around a singular issue; correlation â‰  causation)<br /><br />As certain substances become more culturally acceptable (aka Pot) less heroin-like claims will be made on said substances as all users know that it&#039;s bullshit. Psychedelics still have a long time before they&#039;ll be legal, however.

				You&#039;re missing the reasoning behind why its illegal. It doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s physically &quot;harmless&quot;, but because it makes people act completely insane.

Like making sodomy illegal, because its icky to some people, who aren&#039;t even having it themselves. One day it&#039;ll just look so backwards - we&#039;ll realize how much big pharma had us, and our government (as well as its own anti-enlightenment agenda), by the balls.<br /><br />Weed / mild euphorics won&#039;t require a license, anyone can use them. <br /><br />Addictive / risky drugs (nicotine, powerful stimulants) will have a certain kind of &quot;willpower&quot; license, to make sure you don&#039;t become victimized by the industry behind them / your addiction. (To make sure that you remain in control of your life)<br /><br />Hallucinogens will have a &quot;keep it together&quot; license, to show that you can handle hallucinogens while maintaining an understanding of reality / not just going nuts. <br /><br />Or SOMETHING. I know this sounds like too much governance, but I think that the debate goes deeper than which drugs are &quot;ok&quot; and which aren&#039;t - because that will vary from person to person.

So maybe it isnt sexist. Can men handle it better? Well, maybe but your first trip is kinda weird anyway and ive never tripped with a girl who freaked out when it wasn&#039;t her first trip.

LSD and shrooms make me kind and caring, it helps me bond with other people and inclines me to be generous and forgiving. It was so incredibly hard to understand how anyone could have believe that it was something to be surpressed or demonized, as it was warm and gentle, no less rewarding for the stressed mind than sunlight is for the tired body. This is the only thing that can make me angry while tripping :(<br /><br />I believe the illegality is based on two things:<br />1. Ignorance - probably the biggest reason is a lack of understanding. Neither politicians or police understand, nor want to understand it. Politicians have a priority to get reelected so researching the drugs and starting a debate about them in a propaganda saturated society will destabilize their support among co-politicians as well as the general populace.<br />2. Consumerism - Psychedelics makes you love the earth and the skies, it lets you find greater joy in giving away than recieving. It makes you creative and productive if you use it right - art and music flows from trippin&#039; heads like water from glaciers. Less need for artificial joy/entertainment will lead to an intense decrease in consumption of mass media, and probably many electronic devices. I believe people would be more do-it-yourself inclined, making their own furniture, growing their own food. I also believe a lot of people would turn to vegetarianism which would be devastating for the farming industry (grotesque amounts of money and crops go into the systematic breeding and slaughtering of animals).<br /><br />A psychedelic revolution (a world where a high percentage tries LSD/shrooms/whatever) can not go hand in hand with the current modes of government. There is way to much brushing problems aside, trying to distract the public from problems with cheap jokes and bland entertainment. How can they possibly stay in power if so much resentment was generated towards them? That&#039;s why they are struggling to call us crazy, and we need to show the people around us how staggeringly sane and clear-sighted we are.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant. I hate the government :) lol

				The reason drug policies haven&#039;t been liberalized is because it&#039;s politically useful to create moral panics which translate directly into votes and because it&#039;s good training for police state tactics.&nbsp; As why psychedelics are in the worse schedule, I do think it&#039;s because they pose the most threat to established socio-economic order; consumerism, greed, militarism, worship of wealth, acceptance of poverty, exploitation and degradation as inevitable &amp; morally justifiable in this day &amp; age.

It is incredibly stupid, but around me it is a common saying that the first time you try acid, you know exactly why it is illegal. Crack has no medical or any practical use if i am correct, even coke is used medically, same with weed and i think Ketamine too. <br /><br />The only way to see why it is illegal is to try it your self. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />But it&#039;s less obvious after you try! LSD and shrooms make me kind and caring, it helps me bond with other people and inclines me to be generous and forgiving. It was so incredibly hard to understand how anyone could have believe that it was something to be surpressed or demonized, as it was warm and gentle, no less rewarding for the stressed mind than sunlight is for the tired body. This is the only thing that can make me angry while tripping :(<br /><br />I believe the illegality is based on two things:<br />1. Ignorance - probably the biggest reason is a lack of understanding. Neither politicians or police understand, nor want to understand it. Politicians have a priority to get reelected so researching the drugs and starting a debate about them in a propaganda saturated society will destabilize their support among co-politicians as well as the general populace.<br />2. Consumerism - Psychedelics makes you love the earth and the skies, it lets you find greater joy in giving away than recieving. It makes you creative and productive if you use it right - art and music flows from trippin&#039; heads like water from glaciers. Less need for artificial joy/entertainment will lead to an intense decrease in consumption of mass media, and probably many electronic devices. I believe people would be more do-it-yourself inclined, making their own furniture, growing their own food. I also believe a lot of people would turn to vegetarianism which would be devastating for the farming industry (grotesque amounts of money and crops go into the systematic breeding and slaughtering of animals).<br /><br />A psychedelic revolution (a world where a high percentage tries LSD/shrooms/whatever) can not go hand in hand with the current modes of government. There is way to much brushing problems aside, trying to distract the public from problems with cheap jokes and bland entertainment. How can they possibly stay in power if so much resentment was generated towards them? That&#039;s why they are struggling to call us crazy, and we need to show the people around us how staggeringly sane and clear-sighted we are.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant. I hate the government :) lol<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />That was No rant!!<br /><br />That&#039;s the truth that must not be told!!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Point number 2 was just spot on.&nbsp; It is a change that wouldnt work with todays society yes, but its a change that we need to make work. Otherwise there will be no resources left to live.&nbsp; Were expanding and expanding and just killing our mother earth yeah call me a hippie but goddamn I want the human race to be able to live 10,000 more years not just 100

				<br />Look for the talk by Alan Watts titled The Alchemy of LSD.<br />He explained it very well. The reasons are irrational, sometimes even occult.<br />But i think if you drop acid you will grasp the whole picture yourself..

Many anthropologists have written books on this subject, if not only for the miraculous ways the indigenous peoples knew who to properly recognize the plants and use them in a way that extracted their potency.

				The culture that embraced LSD was seen as a threat to elite power, as a result of a failing education (indoctrination) system. Having higher prison sentences for crack vs. cocaine is a way to lock up a (largely black) underclass who are no longer useful to the economy (since the decline in manufacturing). I recommend everyone watch The House I Live In. It has some excellent monologues from David Simon who wrote The Wire.<br /><br />http://skylo.me/vv.php?Id=62a19bb81f52a7a0ffd8ec814fc7e5a3 (I know this link looks weird. Just google &quot;watch the house i live in&quot; if you don&#039;t want to use that one)<br /><br />Getting caught may well mean that you fucked up, but many other factors are equally or even more important. Factors such as race and class.
