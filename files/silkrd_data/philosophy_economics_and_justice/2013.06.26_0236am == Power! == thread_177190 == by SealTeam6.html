				I don&#039;t like power. I think this is the problem inherent to every ideal.&nbsp; The idea that &quot;I AM RIGHT, THUS BY DEFAULT I GET THE THRONE!&quot; is what leads to problems in this world. If we had something like panarchism as a global mindset, I don&#039;t think we would have as many problems. But this is the problem of the ages. Both liberals, conservatives, and moderates alike.

Because after all we as humans have very little control over our environment when it comes down to it. <br />Also not only do I agree with rastaman, (jah bless) but I have heard some quote about with great power comes great responsibility, cant remember if thats a quote from a person or star wars or something lol, nonetheless its true IMO. The problem, i think, for example with the nsa stuff, is that humans are going to be human no matter what, make mistakes and what have you and be irresponsible, thats what scares me about all that information, mine included, being in the hands of the wrong people or person. I have had enough bad experiences and scares from LE for one lifetime to realize that they are going to power trip and be assholes because thats what we as humans do. Kind of simplifying it a bit but thats the way I see it.

				the only true power we have is over the way we look at things. that in turn defines our actions. <br /><br />control over anything else is an illusion<br />&nbsp;:)<br />we are one&nbsp; ;D
