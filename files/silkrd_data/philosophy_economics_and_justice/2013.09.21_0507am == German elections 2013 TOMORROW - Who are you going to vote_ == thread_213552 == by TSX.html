				I have left out a few very small parties.<br /><br />My vote goes to the Piraten as it did in 2009. They are like 100% matching my opinions, it&#039;s like I wrote their program, freaky.<br />The worst for me (after the 2 nazi parties listed) is definitely the PBC because I have only two political topics that I&#039;m really passionate about and that are really touching my heart, that is in this order:<br /><br />1. LGBT rights.<br />2. Drug politics<br />And every party has to get measured by those two for me at first and disqualifies only with that two if the opinions are really fucked up.<br /><br />The PBC has crazy opinions about homosexuality in general, I&#039;ll quote something about adoption:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Partei Bibeltreuer Fundichristenarschlöcher</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">„Die Gender-Bewegung, wonach dies mit dem Zeitgeist begründet wird, ist abzulehnen. Kinder in diesen Lebenspartnerschaften erhalten durch diese nicht schöpfungsgemäße Lebensbeziehung mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eine Festlegung auf gleichgeschlechtliche Beziehungen. Kinder brauchen die Prägungen durch Mann und Frau.”<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The CDU has the same opinion, but they say it in way that is way less offensive. That does not make it any better of course. They just try not to offend people because they are a big party and want to get their votes, the PBC does not care as they are very small and no one votes them anyway.<br /><br />I&#039;m hetero by the way, but this is something that always was very close to my heart. <br />Especially as a German I think we should be a positive role model for the rest of the world when it comes to treating people fair and equally considering our very dark history.

				If you vote then youre guilty of the crimes, so chose the ones that wanna end the monopoly on using voilence and force (the state) since most of them would probably use a monopoly like that to make crimes n start wars..

Imagine how I feel being surrounded by close minded, conservative humorless robots.<br /><br />That being said Im for Linke.<br /><br />I was for Piratenpartei but they are nothing but hot air and little kids trying to act like they understand politics. They contradict themselves and only have 1 viable argument for a free, non monitored internet.<br /><br /><br />The best, drug friendly and social outcome would be a coalition with a left majority.<br /><br />SPD-Grüne-Linke would be a great start but its going to be SPD+CSU without doubt.

				LINKE and Piraten both do good drug politics AFAIK. I think the LINKE is even more progressive than the pirates on this topic.<br />Bavaria is really, really bad when it comes to these questions, they are very backwards. I&#039;m sorry for you. ;(<br /><br />Also RogerPantade is an idiot and proofs it every day.<br />

				when you vote you give professional liers credibility and they gets to use the democracy to make crimes against you and others like you by using taxmoney.. Just because you voted.<br /><br />Your responsible for everything you do, every action.<br /><br />Stop kissing ass of the wolf since they gonna eat you after youve kissed their ass.
