What do you want? - i replied.<br />&nbsp;No answer....<br />Fuck off then you wanker! i shouted and broke the phone in half. <br />The dream was getting lucid. I decided to abort it. I went to the toilet....<br />woke up.<br />Then i dropped a roll....<br /><br />paranoid comeup. <br />everyone is looking at me. everyone is following me. cameras everywhere. is he filming me? is she recording? they know.. the police! they know...<br /><br />A thought! Its an illusion! same as tripping! Paranoia is an illusion! <br /><br />and it vanished. <br /><br />right away. like it never existed. <br /><br />but something else came up. If paranoia is an illusion then my happy head space is an illusion too! <br />and so that vanished too. <br /><br />I&#039;m left with nothing. Nothing. <br />Emptiness.

				Very very interesting dream, I would agree with it somewhat.&nbsp; Paranoia is definitely an illusion, but happiness an illusion? I don&#039;t think so!&nbsp; Emptiness nah, there&#039;s too much in the world, all worlds, for their just to be emptiness.&nbsp; Very interesting dream tho!&nbsp; I was watching an interesting documentary about dreams, I can&#039;t remember the name but I found it very insightful as far as determining what dreams mean and what evolutionary purpose they serve!&nbsp; If I come across it I will post the name!

Just give it time it&#039;ll pass. Occupying my time with friends, and/or hobbies seemed to help a little. If you&#039;re into meditation that helped me a lot too. The whole nothingness feeling is what really got me into it to begin with.<br /><br />And of course if none of the above works have a really good acid trip, that&#039;ll set you straight ;)

				I wouldn&#039;t say emotions are an illusion, more that they are simply subjective and amenable to adjustment by your nervous system. Emotions and mental states are part of ourselves, they do not exist outside and apart from ourselves, but they are as real as any other experience. All experience is an interpretation of signals from our nervous/endocrine system by our brain (and probably parts of our larger nervous system), so all experience is equally &#039;real&#039; or &#039;illusory&#039; - it&#039;s &#039;illusory&#039; in that our subjective experience can never be a one-one copy of objective reality, but it is &#039;real&#039; in that we really experience it subjectively.<br /><br />To me, it appears you&#039;ve started to become your own meta-programmer - programming your own experience/nervous system and adjusting your mental parameters. What you really need to do next is not to ask if these experiences are illusory, but more to ask yourself; how should I program myself to achieve the best possible experience? Love instead of hate, forgive instead of bear a grudge, be happy instead of sad, when something bad happens look at how to make it better rather than wallow in how it is bad - this is the script of a happier existence! You cannot affect what will happen to you in the future, only how you react and deal with it. You cannot change the destination, only the route which you will take there...

I&#039;m not one to try and dictate what others should do, but I do think too many people try out psychedelics without reading enough philosophy/psychology to give themselves direction. You start re-molding your psyche without having any idea of what you would like the end result to be and I think that&#039;s when most people start to go off the rails a bit. Just another reason to legalize drugs - so that the shamans and gurus came come out from where they&#039;re hiding and guide the new-wave of psychonauts! My ideal situation would be somewhat similar to Aldous Huxley&#039;s &#039;Island&#039;, but then he did write that novel to portray his utopia in contrast to the dystopian &#039;Brave New World&#039;...
