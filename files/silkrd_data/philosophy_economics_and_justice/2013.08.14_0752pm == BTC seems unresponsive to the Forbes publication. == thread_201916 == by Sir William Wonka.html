				This morning i had bitcoin at 98.15 and now it is only 99.14.&nbsp; I heard this article will be published in the magazine in september, does anyone have confirmation on this?&nbsp; Does anyone think any possible rise in BTC due to this article is being offset from the recent questions subpoenas etc regarding bitcoin?&nbsp; Thoughts anyone?

That said, I did think the forbes article was going to drive it up quite a bit....this is surprising. I think once it actually hits the print, you might see some moves....<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here&#039;s hoping I can get my vendor bond sales racked up in time to ask for a refund on the bond when it rises, make some money :D<br />I remember the 10$ btc, But a million, You must be joking?

				The article has only been published online and BTC has gone up 20% as of today. As soon as it is published on the hardcopy of Forbes on Sept. 4th, expect a two fold increase soon thereafter.

				BTC has gotten plenty of attention during the rush. Only people who have been hiding under a rock the last 6 months will not have heard of it by now. BTC is going up because it has been recognized as a real currency now. This makes the public and more investment firms feel better about it, which in turn brings more money into the economy. Regulation of BTC is not a bad thing. They just have to keep better records on the exchanges. As long as you follow proper practices anyways, you will still stay anonymous.

				Considering the winklevii have made an ETF out of the bitcoins we&#039;ll start seeing BTC become a more mainstream alternative fringe asset class.
