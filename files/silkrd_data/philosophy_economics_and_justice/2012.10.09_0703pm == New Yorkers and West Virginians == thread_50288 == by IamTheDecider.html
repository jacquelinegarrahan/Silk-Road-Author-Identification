				Most everyone on here would agree the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is a platform of both the Republican and Democratic parties in the US.&nbsp; Neither party are friendly to the sorts of personal, free decision making which takes place on SR.<br /><br />Two US Senators have bestowed upon themselves -- in their infinite, demigod-like wisdom -- to target SR.&nbsp; Both Senator Charles Schumer (Democrat of New York) and Senator Joe Manchin (Democrat of West Virginia) have sought action from the US Department of Justice to shut down SR.&nbsp; There are other opponents of SR in both parties, but these two have put extra effort into shutting down the website.&nbsp; Senator Charles Schumer of New York in particular.&nbsp; He believes in a government which has to protect people from themselves.&nbsp; I do not.<br /><br />In a deeply blue state such as New York it is nearly impossible to elect any other candidate that isn&#039;t part of the Democratic Party.&nbsp; I would urge New Yorkers reading this, however, to vote -- regardless of your party affiliation -- for the Republican candidate.&nbsp; The same goes for West Virginians.&nbsp; Hold your nose and vote Republican or Libertarian.<br /><br />I am not a mouthpiece for the Republican party by any means.&nbsp; I assure you of that!&nbsp; Send a message to these two, however, that you don&#039;t like them sticking their nose into things like SR where the beauty of laissez-faire capitalism has made itself quite evident.&nbsp; We do not need elected officials assuming office with the misguided belief they possess a mandate to protect us from ourselves.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.

				If you don&#039;t want people having that misguided belief, then don&#039;t vote for them. Because that belief is exactly what a vote will mean to them.<br /><br />Fuck voting altogether. People here of all places should know we don&#039;t have to play by their rules in their stupid rigged game to beat them. And considering that statistically speaking you have a better chance of getting hit by a car and killed on your way to the ballot than of actually influencing a state or Federal election, I say it&#039;s not worth the risk.
