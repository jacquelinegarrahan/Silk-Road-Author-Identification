				We here in the US are burdened by some of the most ridiculous drug laws in the western world.&nbsp; One slip and you are ruined for life.&nbsp; My question is, how is this good for us as a country, where can keep creative, smart, productive and people who could greatly contribute to our knowledge and to society as a whole be burdened with these labels that prevent them from doing these things?&nbsp; We all do little things in our lives that are embarrassing yet we are not labeled as such for our entire lives because they are simply trivial.&nbsp; Imagine having a label for the rest of your life that prevents you from getting a good job or ever being taken seriously.&nbsp; That is what our drug laws do and we are not helping our society one bit by labeling people permanently as these horrible drug users.&nbsp; Millions upon millions of Americans have tried or do use drugs, with this many people you would think there is an active voice that would be heard but people are afraid to speak up for fear of being labeled.&nbsp; We NEED CHANGE and the first thing is through education and the eradication of these insane laws.&nbsp; But people need to talk but not just amongst themselves they need to talk to others who may not be aware spread the word and educate people, share your views, don&#039;t be afraid, and liberate us from these life ruining stigmas and laws that are currently in place

				Jack N Hoff - you are very correct in that - where would the DEA be if we changed these laws, What would the companies that build prisons do?&nbsp; What would all the parole officers do?

				The stigma alone tied to drugs keeps many people quiet even though in their hearts they are pro legalizing most drugs.&nbsp; That and the money aspect make changing the current landscape over drugs a hard fought battle.<br /><br />Money makes the world go round, if you have enough of it, you can make those pesky drug charges go away and not stain your record, if you don&#039;t then life becomes very hard.&nbsp; The drug laws are a real shame and I wish I could do much much more to change it.&nbsp; It&#039;s very depressing to think about sometimes, I&#039;m just thankful for SR for easing the pain through the spread of knowledge.

				It&#039;s not JUST about the money. It&#039;s about the philosophy that most people in society are either too poor, too weak or too stupid to make their own decisions. Government has to &quot;protect&quot; them from harming themselves. Government reserves the right to do whatever a few central planners deem necessary to protect the &quot;public good&quot;. They&#039;re free to tax and regulate whatever they want out of existence. If an individual person gets in their way then they can simply be tased, beaten, shot dead or imprisoned. Most people defend the current system by working 3 or 4 months out of the year indirectly for the government through their taxes. They are also happy to pay for a federal debt in America that has increased nearly 20 FUCKING FOLD since Carter was in office. If we don&#039;t support this system and instead support a very small, very limited style of government based on the constitution then we&#039;ll all just revert back 1000 years and start raping and killing each other at will. So they think. We NEED government. We NEED overwhelming numbers of police armed to the teeth with military weapons. We NEED permanent warfare. The more wars the better.<br /><br />Here is what I wrote a couple of days back in another thread that was almost completely ignored:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There is only one way and really only one way for libertarianism to take hold: collapse.<br /><br />Let me say that again so you get me: COLLAPSE.<br /><br />That means collapse of the dollar to start. Collapse of the monopoly and absolute power of the federal reserve and the government to force people to use the dollar and other state-sponsored currencies. Collapse of the ability of government to collect income tax. Collapse of the ability of government to print unlimited amounts of debt on the backs of the people. Collapse of the ability of government to partner up with corporations because they&#039;re just too small to do it anymore. And collapse of government period.<br /><br />The current state of affairs is driven by a devastating series of events which happened nearly 100 years ago. And they all happened one after another over a short span of time: creation of the federal reserve, creation of the income tax, creation of the first food and drugs act, exacting heavy penalties for &quot;treason&quot; against the government, and of course the prohibition of drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />A protestant religious movement seized control of policy in America back then. They were obsessed with central planning and making sure that &quot;you are your brother&#039;s keeper&quot; no matter the cost. The masses were considered either too stupid, too weak or too poor to think and act for themselves and therefore needed government to take care of them. They thought that laws made men good and oversaw the largest expansion of government ever up to that point. It didn&#039;t help that the eugenics movement was still in full swing, racism was very high and many forms of socialism were sweeping across the entire globe at the time.<br /><br />The government&#039;s REAL power is derived from only two of those things: the ability to collect income tax through any means necessary and to issue debt through the private federal reserve central bank backed by the income tax. Nearly unlimited amounts of debt since the money supply is grossly distorted through this process and the government can do pretty much anything to get its money. The income tax is the basis for our modern surveillance state and money laundering laws. The thing is that I did say &quot;nearly&quot; unlimited and not just unlimited since NOTHING is unlimited and a collapse will follow. The only question is when.<br /><br />I give it another 7 or 8 years. Definitely less than a decade. The economy will collapse along with the dollar. The size of government will reach a certain breaking point and will implode when it loses the ability to collect income tax. Default will follow. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be part of the mechanism which makes this possible.<br /><br />I know you may not want to hear it but everything is governed by cycles and natural law and government WILL become a lot smaller after growing to an unimaginable nightmarish size. You can&#039;t stop it. You just have to adapt to it. Make your own decisions, think your own thoughts and help yourself and your own family and friends instead of expecting others to do all this for you. You have some time to think about this stuff. Just don&#039;t say that no one warned you when it comes. Detroit is only the beginning.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				Just read about the Iran-Contra scandal. Reagan was exchanging weapons for cocaine, which was then sold in America to provide the funds for black ops. Freeway Ricky Ross was buying his coke from the CIA. This shit is pretty deep and there are plenty of authentic citations and papers covering this scandal.A nice right hand point break called Ollie&#039;s point down in Costa is where the secret airbase was located. The CIA even built their own airport to facilitate the weapon/drug smuggling in Liberia Costa Rica on the border with Nicaragua.

				A few things any one of us can do:<br /><br />Write your congressman. I&#039;m not in the USA, so our political representation is a little different, but write to your elected representatives. In my country you can send a letter to your politicians without having to attach a stamp, obviously this may not apply elsewhere.<br /><br />Call your congressman&#039;s office on a regular basis. It&#039;s pretty standard in political circles that 1 phone call equals 10 voters, and one letter equals 10 calls. Legalization of drugs is not my main issue, but I call my representatives&#039; offices at least every 2 weeks about my hobby horse,&nbsp; to let them know that I am still waiting for the politician to act on their commitment to change X.<br /><br />Write letters to the editor to your newspapers, on a regular basis. Especially in more rural areas, but even in the biggest cities, media outlets are starving for content, and letters to the editor are free from the paper&#039;s point of view.<br /><br />Post online in the comments of mainstream media outlets. The more voices, the easier it gets. Use discretion as needed, with a throwaway email address and not using your main facebook page!<br /><br />Get in touch with anyone you know doing time, and write to them. Apply to be on the list so they can call you. If you&#039;re lucky enough to not know anyone who is incarcerated, talk to your church or community group about being put in touch with someone. There are resources online that claim to introduce convicts to penpals, but I cannot speak to the reliability of such services.<br /><br />Volunteer in your community to help those less fortunate. Why? Because it helps counteract the image of drug users as useless, selfish shut-ins who just want&nbsp; to get high. If, and when, you get to the point where you&#039;re moderately known locally as the pro-legalization guy, it will help immensely if you have developed a rep as a solid and helpful person. Plus, good deeds have other merits.<br /><br />Every time one of your elected representatives holds an open house / town hall meeting, go! Doesn&#039;t matter which party, doesn&#039;t matter what level of politics, get you ass in the room with all the grey-haired people and speak up. Ask your questions. Learn how to word it so it will appeal to people who have never used drugs.<br /><br />All of the above require being respectful and semi-articulate, which shouldn&#039;t be too hard. The problem with a community like SR, is that there are many here who would make excellent advocates for the legalization position, but they can&#039;t be bothered to speak up since prohibition is so profitable for them.<br /><br /><br />Wanna know why the laws haven&#039;t changed as fast as society in general has? Because attendance at open houses / town halls, writing letters / making calls, and sending small donations and offering volunteer help on campaigns are all primarily done by old people.

				most people are parasites on this planet and the planet is going to cleanse herself from parasites and most of humanity will burn because they did not care about themselves enough to care about others and the planet..<br /><br />And the survivors will be eaten by massive alien insects since they are the ones controllin humanity thru cloned humans in the democracys.<br /><br />But 15% of humanity will come to the new Earth in 5th dimension while this planet turns into a cold desert like Mars.<br /><br />A change is impossible since most of humanity aint even humans anymore.<br /><br />Trust me I tried to get people into sending the cure for cancer to all homeadresses in a country but no vendors wanted to make a good thing towards other human beings.<br /><br />Probably there is not enough humans that want to do good in this world, the healthcare is all about earning money from treating sick&nbsp; people so how can you ever get people to start sharing because its caring, we got Silkroad and bitcoins but we will probably just use it for drugs since changin the world to something more posetive is not something most people would do.<br /><br />They afraid of change, and they afraid of getting killed if they talked about the ways they are getting killed from air, food and waterpoisoning since thats what WW3 is all about.<br /><br />You americans are the funniest since you seems to think the WW3 is towards someone else then you yet the Georgia Guidestones clearly tells you they are going to kill 90% of the population.<br /><br /><br />I say focus on yourself and dont even think about trying to help people since most people dont wanna be helped, they wanna see what happens if thy continue on their path consuming daily like there is no end to consuming bullshit products.<br /><br />activate your third eye and stop creating karma and you will be alright.<br /><br />Silkroad could have been used to end the war on drugs by sending the letters to a whole population telling them what wrong with the war on drugs.<br /><br />It could have been used to end all wars..<br /><br />But I guess we rather do drugs until the judgement comes. =(

				&quot;Learn how to word it so it will appeal to people who have never used drugs.&quot;<br /><br />Easier said than done. You have to really sell it to those in attendance. Problem is that the greatest part of the demographic that&#039;s against legalization is the 60+ crowd. They&#039;re the largest part of the population (a bit bigger than Gen Y) and also the majority of those who attend your political gatherings.<br /><br />Your best shot is to see something like The Union: The Business Behind Getting High and take notes. Then use those compelling facts and arguments to make the case for legalization. The War on Drugs is so damning and such a colossal failure and embarrassment that if you just list some basics about it then you can win over a lot of people.<br /><br />I still think that the 60+ crowd needs to get to be about 10 years older with most of them suffering from illness before anything will change. This generation is the most self-serving and hypocritical that&#039;s out there. You&#039;d be surprised how fast they can change their tune when THEY need a lot of cheap drugs to be legalized just so they can get through the day.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=211801.msg1543562#msg1543562">Quote from: spanky loc on September 17, 2013, 04:03 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Every time one of your elected representatives holds an open house / town hall meeting, go!

				The day when SR and BTc is used for spreading letters filled with info about the negative effects of the drugwar on societies.. That day we would have world peace since enough people would have the hart to pay a vendor to send the letters to other fellow humans.<br /><br />So that will never happen, we are to into using drugs but not so into creating peace with the tools we got like Btc and SR, in other words anonymity is the key, to be able to donate and spread letters filled with truth.<br /><br />We rather spreadletter filled with drugs tho so the war on drugs can continue, who cares that the weed would cost a dollar per kilo if the war on drugs ended.<br /><br />Lets get back in the hamsterwheel and forget this peacebullshit.
