				There is currently a worrying political trend towards banning porn on the internet.<br /><br />http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57573771-93/eu-votes-to-reject-porn-ban-proposals/<br /><br />and while it seems that this proposal was voted down this time, Europe is not the only place where such a ban was recently proposed. For example, there is a similar law on it&#039;s way in Iceland, where printed pornography is already illegal:<br /><br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/25/iceland-porn-ban-internet-filter_n_2758526.html<br /><br />And of course the US Republican party has similar things in mind:<br /><br />http://www.mediaite.com/online/gop-platform-changed-to-now-target-all-forms-of-pornography/<br /><br />For me this is a really worrisome but also surprising development. After Colorado and Washington legalized weed i really thought the world would slowly become a more liberal and better place. What do fellow Silk Roaders think?

				I don&#039;t think this is something to really worry about. Porn is something that is widely available on the Internet no matter where you are. Any specific government&#039;s efforts to block content is just a symbolic effort at this point and only meant to gain political brownie points among their support base. Sure, any specific government can pass laws that make &quot;something&quot; illegal from online display, but that only applies to ISPs in that country and there are many, many ways to circumnavigate that tactic.<br />Just look at where you are posting this concern to reinforce against any doubts you have.

				I am divided in this question.<br /><br />Why we should ban porn:<br />It seems obvious to me that porn has a degenerative effect on society, as it changes expectations, feeds and creates addictions and profits from suffering (not to say that all porn is created out of pain and tears, but at least some is). The availability of porn has its greatest impact on the youngsters of today. It is not hard (or unusual) for a 9 year old kid to watch hardcore porn, and this affects them. It changes their expectations, (probably)numbs them to &quot;softer&quot; romance. I myself can see how I have been negatively influenced by porn and how it has created more suffering in my life than pleasure. I would be foolish not to admit addiction :( I can only imagine how porn affects the confidence of girls, especially younger ones, but I have read studies that show how porn make relationships deteriorate over time. Men find their own mates less attractive when watching porn at regular intervals, and they feel less satisfied with their sex life. Women, I feel with you :(<br /><br />Why we shouldn&#039;t ban porn:<br />The market is humongous. Any money it makes would be received by criminals. Not all criminals are bad (I&#039;m not!), but when organized, morals tend to go out the window. I don&#039;t like buying weed since the organizations behind the growing, transportation and distribution of weed has a lot of less admirable crimes in their baggage. I can only speculate at how much money there is in illegal porn, how that money would feed the rate of other crimes, seduce and corrupt otherwise sensible people...<br />Not to mention how hard it would be technically to disrupt the online flow of sexual content. I mean... We&#039;ve got Tor, right?<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I don&#039;t want there to be porn, but banning it won&#039;t work. Instead we should ban advertisement. No, I&#039;m serious. How fucking wonderful wouldn&#039;t a world without advertisement be?

				Instead of banning why not educate. Porn is not real and very different from what is like in real life. This &quot;concerned parents groups&quot; always want to blame something else than themselves. Is not TV, is not music, is not internet, is how YOU raise your child.

				Porn should be banned.<br /><br />Have you ever seen ANY good porn? Shame to admit but I&#039;ve seen lots of it as a teenager, and frankly, ALL of it shit.<br /><br />To say porn is a human need is the same as saying cigarettes or fast food are a human need. They&#039;re not.<br /><br />If you want to masturbate, use your imagination. Even the dullest person on earth could come up with something better than you see in an average porn clip.

				I don&#039;t understand the point of banning porn? Who is it hurting? If anything, it does more good than bad. It&#039;s probably keeping a lot of people from getting raped. But this would be an interesting experiment.. ban porn and watch the rape rate spike up. <br /><br />Ban porn?.. The fuck?..
