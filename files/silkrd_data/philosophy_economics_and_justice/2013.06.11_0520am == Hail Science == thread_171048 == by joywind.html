Scientists, being human, are not perfectly impartial. Nor is impartiality a requirement of being reasonable. One must be partial at least to facts over nonsense. You have not described anything here that negates the fundamental superiority of the philosophically scientific approach to all other approaches, when discussing/investigating anything that has consequence in the shared medium that exists outside the individual mind.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Marxism and religion are mixed into the same pool because they are absolutist faiths.

Additionally, the proof is always in the application of a theory/belief system. I do not know enough about Marxism in the ideal sense to speak to its scientific nature, but I do know enough about the historical application thereof to understand that the atrocities done in its name (communism) are not the result of a sufficient and widespread demand for reasonable thought and action.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Placing science to highly is also dangerous, we must always question the absolute.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Science as a philosophical approach is not absolutist about anything but the pursuit of truth.

Science is a process, not a destination. So yeah, if we &quot;simply&quot; believe in the efficacy of an overarching context of commitment to truth (as in facts) and the fastidious, open to review pursuit of truth, we would have gotten the Copernican revolution and we possibly could have had (e.g.) the Internet 200 years ago.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Always question and reevaluate the things you perceive of as true.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Agreed, with the caveat that we have to balance this within the limits of our attention. If all we do is question and reevaluate what we can already reasonably know to be true, we&#039;ll severely hinder our ability to make real, observable progress.

				+1 SealTeam. We are in the same boat, definitely. <br /><br />Most likely the biggest reason I am a theist is because of the order of the universe. I respect science greatly because it is a great tool of discovery used to determine the laws that govern everything from neutrinos and quarks to black holes and supernovas (it&#039;s also amazing to me how many similarities the smallest and largest things we know about have). I also respect atheists greatly because they use a tool as powerful as science to govern their decisions about religion and preexistence. I strongly feel that those who believe blindly without determining what and why they believe what they do are more like nihilists than they realise; stuck in a fantasy world they will never leave.<br /><br />Those who seek the truth with all the means at their disposable deserve and have my respect. Now to expound on what I first said, I believe that without these governing laws of science, our existence simply could not be. Even laws as miniscule as electrons revolving around the nucleus of atoms would cause our universe to disappear if they were not set in place. Maybe I&#039;m partial to the subject, I do a lot of computer programming and my idea of a universe without laws is similar to a computer program without functions. <br /><br />I cannot imagine a law, quantum or non-quantum, that created itself. I think that&#039;s what it comes down to, in essence. It doesn&#039;t make sense to me in a very similar way that the idea of a law being created by a creator doesn&#039;t make sense to many of you. I hate to say agree to disagree, but there is nothing that could ever be said or shown to me (that I can fathom, at least) that could sway me otherwise. I have come to this over years of discovery and free thinking, and it&#039;s not something I&#039;ve been led by anyone to feel. <br /><br />You can easily say &quot;why add something to the pot that the pot does not need.&quot; but really, why not? Does a universe led by rules created by no one –that, as far as we can tell will never stop expanding and contract to create another big bang– make more sense than one created by someone? I think that is a question worth debating through science and known theories, but not something fight over in difference of opinion. If we are to discover, then let us discover.
