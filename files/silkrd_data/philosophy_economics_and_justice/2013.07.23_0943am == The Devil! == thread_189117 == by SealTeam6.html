				That son of a motherless dog!<br /><br />Ok, put aside your beliefs for a minute and just listen, then give me your opinion/thoughts.<br /><br />I like to think that I have a sixth sense per se, I see things coming my way before they happen.&nbsp; (I actually believe that we all have this ability inside of us and it only depends on if we listen to it or not.)&nbsp; Anyway, so last week I begin to feel as if things were not gonna go my way at all.&nbsp; It started with arguments with my loved ones over the most unimportant things you can imagine.&nbsp; I had a very important appointment last week and the night before as I began to prepare, I realized that I couldn&#039;t find some of the paper work.&nbsp; In joking fashion I cursed the Devil for this aloud, letting him know that he was a weak piece of shit, and that he would not triumph over my attempts to go about life and do good.<br /><br />Now to be clear my interpretation of the devil is very open, generally I use the term/name to describe the doubt, worry and negativity that the world lives in and not to mean the traditional fallen angel of God, however I do not dismiss this as a possibility. <br /><br />The next day comes, I don&#039;t find the missing paper work after tearing up the house and car but I still go about my business hoping that I would get some pass for not having it.&nbsp; Driving to my appointment I am slammed into by another car after the driver ran the red light because they were too busy texting and not watching where they were going.<br /><br />Now I am no friend of the law, my license is suspended and I missed court for some petty nonsense so I have a possible warrant I could get hauled in for and be taxed by the beast, I got no business behind the wheel of a car, but I gotta get around like all the other citizens.&nbsp; So I am sitting in my vehicle at the side of the road pondering how in the world my luck got so bad and half in awe of myself for seeing it coming.&nbsp; I am also remembering talking shit about the Devil the night before, but I won&#039;t let this bastard win.&nbsp; I will not fear.&nbsp; I have choices.&nbsp; I can sit in the car and be pissed, panic and freak the fuck out, curse the other driver out for being so careless and fucking up my ride, or I can sit calmly take a deep breath and conquer this situation and the Devils feeble attempts to bring me down to his level, whatever he or it may or may not be.&nbsp; I chose to do the latter.&nbsp; I steadied myself and prepared to deal with the questioning that was about to come my way from whatever officer arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;I stashed away all evidence of who I really was and gave the officer a fake I.D.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; I was also able to pull at the mans human side as well by putting on a show of great distress, this saved me from getting a ticket, because even though I know the fault of the accident was not mine, the law says it was.<br /><br />I keep on truckin and get to my appointment.&nbsp; I am missing some of what I need but hope to charm my way out of it.&nbsp; The person overseeing my issue is not having it, in fact this person is unbelievably unprofessional.&nbsp; The individual seemed to be extremely annoyed and frustrated at my very being, and at more than one point threatened to hit me, even though I surmised it was a joke and part of his/her character, I was still surprised.&nbsp; WTF do you mean you are gonna hit me?&nbsp; The missing paperwork never even came up as an issue, I just ran into a crazy person.&nbsp; Again choices, I can lose my mind and take it upon myself to put this individual in his/her place, or I can again take a deep breath and work a peaceful solution out.&nbsp; I again choose the latter and I am switched to a different individual who handles my business with the utmost professionalism.<br /><br />The next day, I have no car so I am at the mercy of friends and family. I arrange to be picked up but somehow the lines get crossed and my ride can&#039;t make it. It&#039;s 3 in the morning.&nbsp; I call for a cab. None available.&nbsp; My phone dies.&nbsp; I&#039;m 15 miles from home, I know no one in the area.&nbsp; Fuck it, I&#039;m a G, I walk.&nbsp; The Devil won&#039;t win.<br /><br />Next day, I&#039;m riding the bus, this large lady sitting across from me starts wildly coughing into a napkin, really I was the napkin as it splashed into my face.&nbsp; Breath.<br /><br />Next day, on the bus again, bus driver stops the bus to walk to the back to freak out on me that I didn&#039;t pay him enough, although I specifically asked the driver the day before what the fare was.&nbsp; Breath.<br /><br />The last bit of the Devils fuckery I can&#039;t even talk about, but it involves him fucking with my money, seriously trying to play with my emotions.<br /><br />I had to share this because I just found it to be an odd series of events and a triumph over evil, if you believe in those things.&nbsp; The Devil is still playing his game, but the positive will always win.<br /><br />This week seems to be going better, and most of all I am proud of myself for handling these situations in a calm matter.&nbsp; It has really shown me the growth that I have undergone as an individual, ten years ago someone would have got hurt out here! <br /><br />Peace&nbsp; :)<br /><br />

It is depicted in every culture from very ancient times, from east to west. The names changes, however the attributes are mostly the same. The &quot;fallen angel&quot; is an interpretation of the bible that copied the Sumerian texts and turned them over, turning the entity that fought for man&#039;s freedom into the opposite.<br /><br />But you can naturally call your doubts, your fears etc. the &quot;Devil&quot; if you want (but Satan would be better, however, since that means &quot;Shaitan&quot; i.e. adversary, being it an office, not an entity and as such perfect for this role).

				SealTeam, I greatly admire the way you handled yourself thru some shitty adversity.&nbsp; Many of us would have reacted differently and not as admirably.&nbsp; You appear to have reached an understanding with yourself and the world and your place in it...and seem comfortable in your own skin as well as kind and forgiving to others.&nbsp; I&nbsp; tend to think we are the masters of our own fate and the creators of our own luck.&nbsp; If you keep up what you&#039;re doing...taking life as it comes, with a positive attitude, calm demeanor, sense of humor and compassion...you will make your own good luck and you will see things break in your favor.&nbsp; Positive vibes reverberate...&nbsp; Thank you for sharing that slice of your life with us, you captured it perfectly in words and it was very uplifting...at any rate, it&#039;s going to help my day get off to a better start...which will allow those close to me to have a better morning and etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; Good vibes reverberate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Forget about the devil or any external negative enemy ......it&#039;s all YOU, man.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sounds like you&#039;re well on the right path...........cheers.&nbsp; &nbsp; 8)

No of course not, that one is too modern.&nbsp; ;)<br />The man of wealth and fame (Pluto=the Rich one) talking to The Rolling Stones in&nbsp; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; ? <br /><br />Even world governments can change. Perhaps this is linked to the old quarrel between the Babylonian half-brethren Enki and Enlil. (Which might date back even to the days of Atlantis - when it&#039;s rulers had debated how to act on the prophecy of their downfall, they had not been able to agree.)<br /><br />Enlil became YHVH the other become &quot;the Satan&quot; = the adversary. A mere family dispute among the Gods (=Elohim).<br />In the NT, Jesus was perhaps taught by Enki&#039;s followers, whereas the Jewish Phariseés would of course be on Enlil&#039;s side, but until now, Enlil&#039;s still reigns in our &quot;1st world&quot;, demanding obedience from us human servants.<br />[/speculation]<br /><br />It seems, it&#039;s always the God of the previous cultures that is being villified. The picture of the Devil painted by the church seems to be a mixture of pagan deities, the nature loving Pan who likes sex, the horned one (hunter), one feature is even got the Trident of Shiva. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Moreover what the &quot;Devil&quot; can have to do with &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;?

The ideal would be equilibrum, when both Enki and Enlil have got equal power.<br /><br />The TRUTH is with the REAL God is actually above both.<br />
