				So I sadly live a polarized male dominated lifestyle as many of us probably do, I want more balance.<br /><br />I feel being only surrounded by guys makes me impatient, competitive, and extremely in a rush to ascend the hierarchy.<br /><br />I want females, I want to slow down, part of me fears slowing down because I&#039;ve just been pushing so hard for so long, is it ok to slow down?&nbsp; <br /><br />Is there really a point to life besides love?

				Technology and current social conditions seem to spread a lot of hate.(Obviously this is directed at the majority of people, although there are certainly many exceptions) <br /><br />Love is such a powerful thing, it has the ability to unite and create. Hate on the other hand does the opposite.(Makes spreading lies that much easier)<br /><br />Do whatever the fuck you think feels right. Go with your gut feeling, as opposed to second guessing which leads to over analyzing. Human intuition never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />And may i ask what &quot;hierarchy&quot; you hope to ascend. Getting rich, power? They have perks but if you aren&#039;t happy honestly who the fuck cares? My opinion :)<br /><br />Many poor people live much happier,and successful lives IMO than wealthy folk. To each there own i guess

So I think you&#039;re right to seek it out in others, be it women or men. There may be people in your life who are tapped into values that mean something to you and these people are just not apparent because they&#039;re not part of the noise machine. So it may be worthwhile having a look around with fresh eyes. If not, wander afield, seek new people and experiences, and above all, follow your heart.

				It&#039;s really this simple: accept yourself.&nbsp; Yeah, that&#039;s all.&nbsp; Do that and your problem is solved.<br /><br />&quot;Is it okay to slow down?&quot;&nbsp; I have only this statement in response: who gives a flying fuck if it&#039;s okay?&nbsp; Do you want to?&nbsp; If so, you&#039;re wasting your life -- literally wasting time that you can never get back again -- following some social convention that you aren&#039;t even sure is real.&nbsp; If you want to feel things... feel them.&nbsp; Explore them.&nbsp; Indulge.&nbsp; I don&#039;t care if what you really want is to *be* a fucking woman: do it.<br /><br />Remember, many people are afraid to ask for what they want.&nbsp; That&#039;s why they don&#039;t get what they want.<br /><br />It&#039;s okay to be anything you want to be.&nbsp; I guarantee you that you can find people who will accept you no matter what you choose to be -- there may not be many of them, but they&#039;re out there somewhere no matter how &quot;unacceptable,&quot;&nbsp; you may end up choosing to be.

				This is a culture problem not a gender problem.&nbsp; Go check out the opposite extreme, hang out with some organic hippie pot smoker farmers, and everything in between that and the corporate fueled rush world.&nbsp; Society is beyond disgusting, it takes nothing more than a mildly in depth look at the methods and actions of our criminal justice system as well as both domestic and international governmental policy, and peoples opinions on the actions taken as such.&nbsp; (lol prison rape, who cares if they never get a real job they were drug dealers, whatever if we bomb some children WHAT ABOUT TERRISTS)&nbsp; I may share the views Thompson expressed in fear and loathing regarding Tim Leary, but &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; isn&#039;t necessarily a terrible bit of advice, especially the last part of it.

				FingertotheFBI,<br /><br />May I make a suggestion? If you do desire a woman to spend time with, try looking abroad for a broad. If you are in a Western nation or a heavily Westernized nation (and I am assuming you are based on your screen name and your use of English), you may be quite surprised at the quality of relationships with women you can have when those women grew up outside of this bash-your-head-in-just-to-get-one-more-dollar culture.<br /><br />I took some time off when I was kicked out of school and traveled to South America (where the grass is green AND the girls are pretty) and I found life to be slow paced and the women to be....feminine. Its hard to describe but there were times the difference was subtle and other times the difference was huge but there was always a difference and to me at least, that difference was always positive.<br /><br />I learned a lot from those women about what a relationship between men and women could be and in my opinion what it should be. The depth of love I saw down there between husbands and wives and the love and warmth I experienced from women, many of which became like sisters to me and who I still stay in contact with, changed me in a lot of ways. I grew up quite a bit when I went down there for a lot of reasons.<br /><br />Its a suggestion and maybe you&#039;ve already explored some of those options but I have found sometimes it is good to get away from Uncle Sam and see what lays outside his influence. At any rate, the best of luck to you friend and I hope you find everything you&#039;re after.

Slowing down is one of them. Patience is another. Being receptive to others around you and to your own needs, giving yourself time when you need it or to take care of someone else, knowing that it&#039;s okay to be sensitive, or indecisive, or emotional (as in to just deeply feel). Create some beauty and clarity around you by acting with intention. Another important trait is nurturing - are you nurturing yourself? Those you love and the environment around you? <br /><br />There&#039;s lots of points to life, but in the light of love, I feel the most fulfilling things are the ones we enjoy. Happiness definitely expands when shared, but if there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve learned, is that truly loving another person starts by truly loving and accepting ourselves. I don&#039;t think lovw can be quantified as you ask, there are so many kinds of love and all are unique and subject to you and your experiences... But unconditional love just is that, no matter where or with who or what. What we are here to learn is grow out of whatever conditioning we&#039;ve had that gets in the way of us being ourselves/happy/fulfilled to our fullest potential.

Just by asking them openly in this forum made it easier for you to relate with others and hear different opinions. BUT - I still believe that you knew the exact answers deep down, and you weren&#039;t just ready or willing to spell them out. I might be wrong, but I&#039;m saying this from my personal experiences, usually when I ask questions of this kind, I realize that I knew the answers all along.<br /><br />Peace,

				^Your right every-time I ask these type of questions on here deep down I know the answer sometimes I think I just need other people to say it to help me realize what I&#039;ve know all along.<br /><br />For an update of my life, things are going well and always improving :) I&#039;ve slowed down, I&#039;m socializing and conversing with not only more people but with the opposite sex and it feels good I don&#039;t need to pursue the opposite sex in a sexual way, I enjoy just engaging in life with them its amazing something I&#039;ve really never done before atleast besides a level of bs small talk.<br /><br />I&#039;m finding that when I actually live I love life!!!!
