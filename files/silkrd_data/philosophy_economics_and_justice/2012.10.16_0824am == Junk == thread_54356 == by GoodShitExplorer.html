				I prefer to take more of a scientific space/time&nbsp; approach to this question. I&#039;m not an authority on physics (but if anyone is please jump in), but I believe that everything that has already happened and everything that will happen is already in existence. <br /><br />Each of us experiences our own version of time. There isn&#039;t ONE universal time, but many many versions of time. This is due to how space and time are directly related. If you and I are sitting across form each other and not moving relative to each other then our clocks are in sync. As soon as one us gets up&nbsp; and moves, our movement through space throws our clocks out of sync. Why don&#039;t we experience this on a day to day level? Because we&#039;d have to be moving near the speed of light to see any real difference, OR be so far across space (thousands if not millions of light years away from each other) to measure the effect relative to each other. <br /><br />Experiments on earth where synced atomic clocks were separated and one was flown around the globe show that the clocks are out of sync by millionths of a second upon re-comparison. For each of the clocks time ticked normally, but in relation to each other something changed. This is where time and space play off each other and roughly speaking if you have more of one, then you have less of the other and vise verse. It also means that we experience time differently from each other.<br /><br />To get back to the original question - Do we have free will? Since there isn&#039;t just ONE universal time, but many relative &#039;times&#039; then it should be possible to look not only back in time, but forward as well, depending on our relative perspective to each other. Every moment that has happened or will happen is already per-determined in relation to something else. <br /><br />So no, I don&#039;t think we truly have free will, unless we start talking about infinite&nbsp; parallel universes which split from our own at every moment in time .. in which case I&#039;m gonna have to smoke a really big fat one to get into.

				according to hinduism, free will is what makes us different from animals, rest is not much different. In Hinduism for example free will is key component of karma system. Only humans create karma, bad or good, because animals do not have free will, they do not create any karma. Sometime original meaning of karma misinterpreted. In Hinduism strictly speaking karma cannot be changed during our life time at present cycle of death and birth, The way we use or free will, going to affect karma of our next life.<br /><br />personally, I&#039;m not a proponent of any religion, still, I think it is interesting interpretation or point of view on free will.
