				Its annoying but it happens and itll happen forever, at least for the rest of my life there will be misinformed (or disinformed) brainwashed people chugging their booze and causing trouble where there is no need for any.<br /><br />I hope you finished that blunt my friend and blew the smoke right in her face.<br /><br />I cannot believe NOONE there took your side, i feel like at a party there would&#039;ve been at least some other people who defended your usage.<br /><br />

				Anger is probably not the right thing to feel when confronting ignorance. I try to respond with pity. When something like &quot;drugs are bad&quot; is this engrained, this universal, and this accepted by the vast majority of society there is little you can do. Weed will be legal with in the next 20 years across the entirety of the US most likely but we are centuries away from reform for hard drugs. I&#039;m the kind of person who have exhaled in her face like in the scene from American History X, but yeah, don&#039;t let it get to you.

				My girlfriend WAS the same way, but after weeks of teaching her she was brainwashed like the rest of us, she realizes that a lot of illegal substances are safer than most legal substances. She used to say &quot;if it&#039;s illegal it has to be bad&quot; /facepalm <br />I&#039;ve taught her a lot though.<br /><br />Personally, I think it is absolutely ridiculous the government tries to dictate what we can and cant put inside our body.

				Its pure bullshit that cannabis is illegal in the first place. <br /><br />Its a plant. No mere human can simply outlaw its right to exist. Its has just as valid of a right to be here on this Earth as you and I. Not to mention, cannabis has medicinal properties where tobacco does not. A friend of mine survived cancer, and the only thing that helped her get through the chemo was smoking weed.<br /><br />People who accept the word of authority figures as penultimate truth (&quot;if its illegal it must be bad&quot;) never learned to think for themselves. Its sad, but our society discourages it. I think the best thing to do it these situations is just to just lay out the facts. Educate the poor ignorant fuckers and maybe they can learn to make their own decisions instead of just parroting back the propaganda they&#039;ve been spoonfed.&nbsp;

				While I find the idea that a substance can be illegal in it of it&#039;s self to be completely fucked, I have to disagree with your reasoning. All substances should be legal, but not because they&#039;re &quot;plants&quot;. Papaver somniferum and the coca plant are also &quot;plants&quot; and they&#039;re the source of crack and heroin.

Processing is man made, the plants come from the Earth. Man is justified in legislating himself and his processes. What grows from a seed if off limits. Seeds don&#039;t understand laws. <br /><br />Personally I think all drugs should be legal, government has no business legislating what people can or cannot put in their own bodies. Its just extra absurd when they declare a plant growing out of the ground an outlaw.

				I feel Nyaruko also had my own share of rubbish thrown by ignorant people trying to convince me to stay away from harmless substances like weed. At first you get angry, then you learn to ignore / associate yourself with other circles i.e. most of the times nowadays I&#039;ll be with my own circle of people who are all in the same frequency rather than join groups where the majority are idiots like the one described.

This is purely naturalistic fallacy. Everything is a plant or a mineral. To claim a drug is better or safer because it &quot;grows out of the ground&quot; is nonsense. And &quot;processing&quot;?&nbsp; Is that where they add the evil?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am totally against prohibition, and I agree that legalising cannabis is even more of a no brainer. It is far less harmful than alcohol tobacco or heroin. But not because its a plant.

				I know a crowd that regularly uses amphetamine paste eg speed. They say how bad Ice (meth) is and it makes you crazy etc but they fail to realize how similar the 2 products are. Life lesson - DO NOT COMMENT ON SOMETHING YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU JUST COME ACROSS AS SILLY unless the general concensus around said crowd is the same thing which most of the time it is (meth is a killer).<br /><br />In the news every 3 months here in oz we get the regular (meth/ice destroying hospitals people crazy etc) what about alcohol? LOL. Meth don&#039;t ,make you crazy if you are idiot and uneducated tool before you consume then a mind altering drug will just make you a even more idiot and uneducated tool who just has more confidence and also thrives off media and societys views that meth makes you crazy strong and people get really scared of the temper of a user.

				yea, I still regularly hear people recite the myth or many variations of &#039;LSD/mushrooms make your spine/brain bleed&#039;<br /><br />I remember in high school this one kid, who was by no means dumb by academic standards, in fact well above average, spout off this line of bullshit:<br /><br />&quot;When you do mushrooms, it causes scars to form on your spine. Flashbacks are caused when these scars burst open months or years later, releasing the still active drug into your bloodstream&quot;<br /><br />I am pretty sure that this myth originated from a faulty study in the 50&#039;s that claimed that LSD caused massive brain bleeding, but it turns out whatever they considered &#039;brain bleeding&#039; was actually caused in higher amounts by caffeine!<br /><br />A lot of college kids around me are starting to use MDMA regularly, but among many of them remains an illogical fear of LSD. As if MDMA is better for your brain...but no, LSD makes people crazy! *gasp*

				I think marijuana being legal would have a massive amount of positive effects and a low amount of negatives; at the very least, the positives would outweigh the negatives. There are seriously so many positives, I have a massive list. Its just so frustrating! <br />I would love nothing more to hang out with people with the status quo being to get high instead of getting drunk.&nbsp; No one has ever tried to kill me when they were stoned.

				Great topic. I used to have an argument with them in the beginning.<br />I guess it&#039;s natural desire to share such precious knowledge and help others.<br />Then of course i became aware of that total ignorance, cultural conditioning, brainwashing.<br /><br />Now I think it was precisely that vast ignorance which has sparked my interest in various occult sciences.<br />I&#039;ve discovered that this issue had been well known to the various hermetic teachings and alchemists.<br />In fact they&#039;ve been carrying the flame since ancient times and they are well aware of the methods of inquisition.<br />We&#039;ve been always prosecuted for telling the truth to those who are not yet ready to hear it.<br /><br />A question is the most powerful part of the language.<br />We really should tease them with questions<br />then wait for questions and only after that give answers.<br /><br />Studying of memetics has also been very useful in understanding<br />why would they fight for their illusions and cultural conditioning.<br /><br />Maybe we should really change only those precious few who we love and share our life with.<br />Because initiating others we share responsibility for how this knowledge will be used.<br />

				Yeah, there are a lot of prejudices against drugs.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br />Anyway, I never understood how the people (the State, LE, etc) can feel righteous to allow or disallow you to take any substance.<br />When I was fourteen, I said that the people who took drugs were idiots, were damaging their brain, spending money, fucking their health etc And that It was completely irrational to fuck you over that way. I have to say that I was some kind of &quot;Social Darwinist&quot; by that age, and with a lot of misunderstood shit about Nietzsche, Stirner etc <br /><br />My first touch with drugs would be with alcohol, almost three years ago, I got caught by LE with hacking charges at sixteen, and without a computer I started socializing and taking alcohol, going to parties etc Then I went to USA from Europe, and well, I took some weed there, and this first events made me feel more comfortable with them.<br /><br />Then I started a relation with a girl who was a heavy marihuana user, and had some common drug experience. Some conversations with her made my look into the drugs world. I&#039;m some kind of information lover, so in a few days I knew more about drugs than anyone else I ever knew. Dozens and dozens of hours spent on Erowid, Shroomery, dmt-nexus, drugs-forum or bluelight.. With less prejudices againts drugs, and being considered a druggie myself by my old high standards of what a man would had to be.. not a lot of months later I would have tried all common drugs, then I started RCs, and I have been on SR since a year. And I have to thank SR for that, because here the quality and variety of drugs is mostly weed, cocaine, speed, mdma and ketamine.. and all with a purity as low as shit.<br /><br />Where I live the consumption of heavy dosages of alcohol is pretty standard. Almost all my friends get very drunk every week, some take weed, and the less, but still a bunch, take ocasionally mdma or cocaine.<br />Some have tried 25i-nbome and DMT but just because of my direct influence. The DMT was liked by all, but I suppose none of them really broke through, and the 25i-nbome, of five friends just one disliked it, and his critics were directly to psychedelics and not the substance side effects per se.<br /><br />What is funny is that a person totally drunk, who maybe even has urinated himself, can&#039;t walk, do some kind of fight or vandalism etc It&#039;s something pretty normal. Here my parents or the parents of your friends see you almost not being able to talk or walk because of alcohol, and It&#039;s nothing bad, maybe even some laughs the next day, and a sensible, but not enforcing, &quot;drink that much alcohol is bad&quot; with a serious and at the same time funny face..<br />If they see you under the influence of some psychedelic, or another kind of drug.. you would be a junkie, bad influence, a guy throwing his life off etc etc even if you are like almost totally operative! It&#039;s pretty funny I going to a party and taking some PEA/etc. Them drinking and drinking until they became some kind of non-talkable-to, random-movement-dancers monkeys all over the place. I&#039;m not saying anything about the alcohol itself, or even the high doses, as I had tried and like it a lot of times, but It&#039;s just to make a comparison between myself who tries some drug at a sensible dosage, and them taking some drugs at intoxicating levels.<br />Them are normal people having fun. Myself with some PEA with a medium or even high dose, I&#039;m a druggie. Even if the PEA is better to the health than the alcohol, even if It&#039;s not addictive or less than alcohol, even if you are ten times more operative than a drunk person and the next day you wake up perfectly. I remember me going to the taxi without the effects of any drugs I took it a lot of hours before, and them still drunk, don&#039;t being able to talk.. like zombies. I was perfect, I enjoyed the party totally, and I was going home sober. The next day almost not side effects, and them crying about the hangover. But I was the irresponsible, who doesn&#039;t know how to have fun, junkie, bad boy guy.. Oh yeah<br /><br />I don&#039;t know, even with high doses of nbomes, 2c-x, mdma etc I have been at most equally fucked up than with alcohol, but 95% of the times not fucked up at all compared to the same dosage of alcohol.<br />The society&#039;s view is totally distorted, is obvious. And try to reason with them about it is hard as fuck. Most will treat you like a crazy druggie person, or literally evade the topic. Even get in some kind of parental way about you saying &quot;Leave that shit off, you&#039;re fucking your life etc etc&quot; And that is people who take alcohol every week, and smokes every day.<br /><br />In my town there is the gossip that I&#039;m some kind of junkie. Well, I&#039;m stuying an engineering degree with a 3+ GPA without even going to class (in Spain we don&#039;t use that scale, and the marks are not as important as another places), I&#039;m learning Russian and German and all my fucking life is going OK. And some fucking cocksuckers gossipers in my town have to talk shit about my drug consumption even if them or their sons don&#039;t even have the fucking high school, and are a fucking bunch of uneducated redneck Spain equivalents ?<br />I&#039;m maybe harsh about that, but fuck, that a friend say to you that his parents, uneducated, and with all kind of debts, and people around alike are talking shit about me. Well, maybe (I doubt it, buy anyway..&nbsp; ::) ) I&#039;m fucking over taking drugs two times per month, or none if I&#039;m in exams. But shit, just work over your fucking and clearly messed up life and stop with your prejudices. <br />I think I just got infuriated with gossipers instead of drug haters, but anyway..&nbsp; :D :D :D :D<br /><br />Bye&nbsp; ;D

				obkkoa I guess the issue of substances is just another great example of how much more ignorant people are than we think. Personally I stopped caring and just contribute where I know I can make a difference. It&#039;s really not helping wasting your time with total jerks who will stick to their dogmas even when faced with the clearest truths. For them, it&#039;s not about the issue of substances or anything else, but how much a distorted view of reality they have. There is always the chance they will start seeing the truth, but it needs their will first, and that we cannot instill to them (trust me I&#039;ve tried). <br /><br />As for substances, for the occasions when you do have a conversation, I find my best punch line is using the diagram of dependence/physical harm (including substances a lot of people think are not drugs because they are legal such as Tobacco and Alcohol). They rank about 2 times as more addictive than weed and ofcourse much more harmful. The chart was prepared by the UK government&#039;s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs so it cannot be argued that it has some agenda of some organization to promote weed etc.&nbsp; --&gt; Clearnet link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rational_scale_to_assess_the_harm_of_drugs_(mean_physical_harm_and_mean_dependence).svg
