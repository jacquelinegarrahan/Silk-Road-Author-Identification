				have been reading alot about this hidden knowledge of the ancients, and it is just mind boggling...Can anyone else add anything to this!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I believe we are in a very imprtant transitioning period for mankind, and learning to get our spirituality back.&nbsp; Things are going to be changing very rapidly in science in the near future....

				that is very interesting, my friend!&nbsp; I am interested in what other hidden knowledge you have discovered... i am just in the beginning of trying to strengthen my aura... Just discovered a documentary called SIRIUS... it is pretty insane, about the reality of Extra-terestrials. WOW is all i gotta say!<br /><br />I have also found that all harmful diseases, live in an acidic body.&nbsp; If you balance the ph of your body, and keep it most alkaline, you will be free of these diseases.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 528Hz frquency H20<br /><br />&nbsp; There is just sooo much to learn, and sooo little time.<br /><br />

It is usually out there, in the open, all it takes is for you to wake up and open your eyes. If you&#039;re searching for &#039;secret&#039; tricks, magik, or elixiars and the like, you are facing the wrong direction. <br /><br />You want real hidden knowledge? Study taoism - that&#039;s the best advice I can give. There are many paths, but taoism seems clearest to me. I have just found an excellent podcast on the subject; The Drunken Taoist. Check it out, but start at Ep.1 and work forward...

You spout off bullshit about nutrition when you know NOTHING on the subject of real objective health with relation to the macro numbers your body needs. PH balance is a load of horse shit. You need 3 macros to live. Protein/carbs/fat. Anything else the body needs is a trace element that can be picked up via PRIMAL MEAT CUTS or in more recent society MULTIVITAMINS. Please stop spouting off this bullshit time and time again as it is NOT wisdom to give out incorrect nutritional info, in fact it is a really shitty thing to do since it can hurt people in the long run that don&#039;t know what they are doing.

				If you&#039;re interested in hidden knowledge, check out this forum/website called Esoteric Online. They have tons of great info there and awesome people. As for vibrations and frequencies, all I can say is go to a Bassnectar concert. He&#039;s onto something. <br /><br />At one of my first Rainbow gatherings I witnessed about 200 of us &quot;OHM&quot;ing in unison, hidden deep in the woods around a fire. That was powerful.

				Imma out myself here. I am a tinfoil hat wearing, tree hugging, dirt worshiping, spirit having a human experience. I am also an empathic healer, using touch. What I do cannot be measured, quantified, or observed through normal means, yet I have harnessed an ability I believe is dormant in our species: The ability to know what is wrong with our bodies, and heal them. <br /><br />When it comes to soft tissue damage, neurological damage, intramuscular damage, I can harness my internal energies, and channeling my &quot;gift&quot;, for lack of a better word, directing the energy paths to facilitate healing. Yes, I have studied reflexology, shiatsu, and massage therapy. My &quot;talent&quot; is enhanced by the knowledge I have gained through study and application. <br /><br />I have even worked with cancer patients, patients recovering from surgery, children, and animals. I am not a doctor, though I like to play one in private(s).<br /><br />I do not believe I am an anomaly. That being said, I have never met anyone else who can actually do what I do, but I have seen my kung fu shifu glow in the dark after an hour of tai chi. That was amazing. I am also incredibly right brained, logical, analytical, and require the scientific method for unsubstantiated claims to be vetted before giving&nbsp; them anything other than a passing glance.
