				First I think it is important to do know how you define god?<br />For example in Arabic the word for god is ilaah. And is usefully mistranslated as god.<br />But the literal translation is object of worship.<br />That would bring on to the next word what is the definition of worship.<br />Worship would be any act that is done for the sake of acquiring the pleasure/reward of the object of worship in question.<br /><br />I know this is not really the answer to your question. Because only know I read your full post<br /><br />PS a person can take his own desires as an object of worship. And doing acts that would please them. <br /><br />Wish you the best.

				Apollo. <br /><br />God of light, music, arts, knowledge, healing, plague and darkness, prophecy, poetry, purity, athletism, manly beauty, and enlightenment. He is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis. As brother and sister, they were identified with the sun and moon; both use a bow and arrow. In the earliest myths, Apollo contends with his half-brother Hermes. In sculpture, Apollo was depicted as a very handsome, beardless young man with long hair and an ideal physique. As the embodiment of perfectionism, he could be cruel and destructive, and his love affairs were rarely happy. His attributes include the laurel wreath and lyre. He often appears in the company of the Muses. Animals sacred to Apollo include roe deer, swans, cicadas, hawks, ravens, crows, foxes, mice, and snakes.<br /><br />too good to be true
