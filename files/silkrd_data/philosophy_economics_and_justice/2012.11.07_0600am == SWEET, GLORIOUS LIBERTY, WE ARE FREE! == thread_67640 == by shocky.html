				Marijuana is LEGALIZED in Washington state.<br /><br />http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/06/amendment-64-passes-in-co_n_2079899.html#slide=887952<br />http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/recreational-pot-ballot-3-states-article-1.1197725<br />blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2012/11/06/initiative-502-passes-to-legalize-regulate-and-tax-marijuana/<br /><br />We are free at last, in a few states. But remember. NEVER become complacent. Don&#039;t think that your freedom ends at drugs.<br />Ending war and poverty is also important. We must continue to innovate for the future and NEVER give up hope and courage.<br />I expect to see this legalization spread through the rest of the USA in the next few years.<br />We held on, and we made it, Silk Road. <br />I&#039;m proud of you.

				Oh ya Colorado and Washington are now legal.&nbsp; I hope these are the first few dominoes to fall of many and i believe they may be just like they were when it came to medical marijuana.&nbsp; I would like to applaud these states for having well educated and open minded voters because that is exactly what it takes to pass a law such as this.&nbsp; I just hope the federal government can learn from these well informed and educated states however because our federal government is run by big businesses such as pharmaceutical, tobacco, and alcohol companies who oppose legalization i remain pessimistic...&nbsp;

				I remain hopeful. There are good people doing hard time and many violent offenders walk free sooner. LET MY PEOPLE GO! SR has been a Godsend for me.. Gone are the days of weird shady deals in bad places. Lack of choice. No quality control (which can be deadly). The only thing now is the risk of being caught in the prohibition game. I am an educated adult who works and pays taxes and when I am on my own time I like to make my own decisions about the things I like to do and how to safely do them .Today is just the start of a long journey but we finally have a foothold.

				You gotta take a long view on ending the drug war. The legalization of MJ in these two states are major victories for our side, but the even bigger victory is the major swing against the drug war by an increasing majority of Americans. We&#039;ll keep it up, and in 20 years the playing field will look much different in the US!

				I believe all the marijuana amendments that passed in various states take effect Jan 1, 2013.&nbsp; The day the floodgate crashed down, be prepared SR haha.<br /><br />And yeah HH, most medicinal states you can smoke a j in front of a cop but expect to be harassed since it&#039;s still technically illegal in a public place or to smoke before driving...they still don&#039;t have a valid test for that...but the law exists.<br /><br />:)

				If weed was legal...then you couldn&#039;t be drug tested for it at a job interview?&nbsp; &nbsp;Right?&nbsp; <br /><br />The only reason I don&#039;t smoke pot is it stays in the system way too long.&nbsp; If it becomes legal nationwide I may just say &quot;screw all these pills, I am just going to go back to smoking a joint once a day&quot;

				Obama is in a tricky spot now. On the one hand he&#039;s going to be under massive pressure by big cotton and big pharma and all the other fucksquads he&#039;s intertwined with to keep oppressing Americans under federal law. But on the other hand, does he want to be known as the President that kept oppressing you and ignored the voice of the people?<br /><br />Then again, he did that with the medicinal marijuana laws and refused to acknowledge the states&#039; rights. But this is only the beginning.. Many other states will vote on this and vote to legalize it. <br /><br />I think Obama is going to have to legalize it on a federal level or face massive dissent. <br /><br />The people have clearly spoken. This will be very telling.. What does Obama value more, big business or democracy. Let&#039;s see if the guy&#039;s got a pair of cannon balls or not.

That&#039;s not how it works. That&#039;s the congress&#039;s job, and don&#039;t hold&nbsp; your breath that the right wing house will do anything to further the legalization of MJ. Obama could have, and should have, exerted more influence over the justice department to quell federal action against dispensaries in his first term, I totally agree with that. But I think the perspective to take, is that these victories in legalizing MJ will further communicate to the justice department a turning of the tide in public perspective of prosecuting MJ users. It would beggar the imagination to think that the JD&#039;s response with this will be to ramp up efforts to police MJ in these states.

He diod not change State Federal law so they can still act if growers exceed there given limits. Think it was 25 plants. The show that I watched about a grow op was limited to 25 plants there genetics can grow 18&#039; tall and yield between 5 -7 lb

				Yay for Detriot and Flint too! Congrats to all the voters who now have it better than everyone else in out country.<br /><br />It&#039;s funny, I didn&#039;t care at all about the congressional or presidential election. I just wanted to see what would happen with the marijuana legislation. <br /><br />Obama will never be for the legalization or the federal approval of medicinal marijuana, so don&#039;t get hopes too high. Ron Paul to the rescue!
