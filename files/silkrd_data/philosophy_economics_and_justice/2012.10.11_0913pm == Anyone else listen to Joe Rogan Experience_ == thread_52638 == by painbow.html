				Actually, Joe Rogan&#039;s development is really a fascinating thing to watch. You know this guy was straight as an arrow goodietwoshoes, never used drugs, dun break the law, comply to make career type of deal. Then somehow he got an epiphany and saw the light. Truly amazing story.<br /><br />(Although he&#039;s going a bit overboard vis-a-vis Alex Grey crazy)

I&#039;ll have to find that ep where he had on Alex Grey though, liked his artwork ages ago and would be curios to hear what he has to talk about.

				I have listened to it and when it is a topic Joe agrees with it is interesting, but if he has a different opinion he is a giant douche that he has always been. I understand liking psychs and promoting them, but when you promote them while wearing Affliction and Tapout clothing with the demeanor of the Sham Wow guy on steroids some how the point gets lost to me. Maybe I am too judgmental, but somebody like Terrence McKenna even with his wildest theories and future telling computer programs makes me want to listen and give the ideas he presents a fair chance, but Joe makes me think of a guy approaching middle age still having his frat buddies come over to get drunk on PBR so that they can circle jerk to UFC fights while they talk about how much they really like chicks and aren&#039;t being gay because it is a &quot;bro thing&quot;.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll echo the sentiments that the Adam Kokesh interview REALLY chapped my ass about Joe.<br /><br />Not fond of the MMA segments except the nutritional ones with Rob Wolff<br /><br />Starting to really like David Seamen who comes on plugging his Congressional campaign in Florida.<br /><br />The Bobcat interview was one of my favorites along with any Shane Smith. <br /><br />JRE has done a lot of good in my life.

				Joe Rogan didn&#039;t bring me here.<br /><br />Anyway, about the podcast with Adam Kokesh I can understand why Kokesh viewers might have understood Rogan as being rude and not giving a great response, well he wasn&#039;t. The problem I see is that Kokesh was completely dickridin&#039; Rogan the entire episode, sucking up to him repeatedly for like 40 straight minutes. It got tiring to watch. The reason Rogan didn&#039;t want to sign up for Kokesh&#039;s message or &quot;deal&quot;, or whatever, is probably because he doesn&#039;t agree with it or feel as strongly about it as Kokesh does. I don&#039;t think they share the exact same ideology, for example Rogan isn&#039;t an anarchist, but Kokesh is. Also, when someone is sucking up to you like that it&#039;s quite hard to be appreciative. Either way, I&#039;m not saying Rogan is an angel, he is repeatedly abusive towards Redban and obnoxious, rude, and straight up dumb sometimes also. But, I have to emphasize, so are most of us also at times, nobody is perfect. I have watched a lot of JRE, I enjoy most of it, but as someone posted earlier it depends on the guest. I loved the one with Shane Smith because I also watch a lot of Vice.<br /><br />The Joe Rogan Experience is a great show, has its flaws, but regardless still a great show to be viewed. Episode quality varies but most often it&#039;s great.

				I like that Joe Rogan is bringing DMT to the forefront.&nbsp; Hey, we need to talk ... and that&#039;s what he&#039;s doing ... presenting it not as an illicit, addictive drug like the mainstream/media/governments believe or want us to believe. Only I haven&#039;t heard him say that it smells like an Egyptian sarcophagus.

				I&#039;ve only caught one episode of the show and it was damned good.&nbsp; Not because of Joe Rogan but because of the guests and the topics they brought to the table.<br /><br />As far as Rogan is concerned I don&#039;t keep up with him enough to know of the egomaniac claims but I do know he once gave away his old isolation chamber since he was getting a new one...that&#039;s pretty badass in a couple different respects.

				Of course he might be buying off of SR but you got to remember a man of his status in society might have really good connects anyway. But, there is a video on Youtube, from the JRE, where Redban mentions Bitcoin and the Silk Road, and JR goes on to mention an article about SR. They go on talking about it, saying that it&#039;s stupid to buy drugs through mail or whatever, totally dissing the site. But whatever, he might still have tried it, who knows.
