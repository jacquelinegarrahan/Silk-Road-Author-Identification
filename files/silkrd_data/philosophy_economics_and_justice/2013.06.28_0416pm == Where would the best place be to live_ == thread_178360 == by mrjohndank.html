				I am thinking of moving from the US after school, but I don&#039;t know where I want to live. I am libertarian, but as long as I can earn money and everyone leaves me alone, I will be fine. I am interested in fucking a lot of ladies, in investing, entrepreneurship, electronics, traveling, and unique cultures. I will be graduating with a BA in Finance from a decent B school. I am leaning toward SE Asia or S. America. Where do you think would be the best country for me. I am also looking for a low cost of living. (This is under philosophy do to investing and libertarianism being the most important criteria).

				Asian countries are mostly either authoritarian, religiously conservative and/or corrupt.<br /><br />If you&#039;re a white guy, you&#039;ll have women chase you everywhere in some places (Thailand).<br /><br />The country with the most personal freedoms, in my opinion, is the Netherlands, or possibly Uruguay.<br />

				I reckon Thailand is the place for you as you can fuck as many women as you like they love any westerners, brilliant traveling, people really friendly, LE aren&#039;t that much of a problem as you can pay them off.<br /><br />I am hoping to move there within the next few years going back there in September for three weeks.

				I would also like to suggest Thailand. Great food , Easy to get a visa , $150 a month for a nice apartment , millions of young beautiful women and the possibility of work if you need it. All in all its an amazing country. <br /><br />And like someone else mentioned police are paid off with bribes and tickets paid to the police in person.<br /><br />You could also buy a crazy nice condo for under $20,000.

Uruguay and the Netherlands have legalised (or as good as) cannabis. Of course, other drugs are still illegal, but most of the rest of the world can’t even manage legal weed.<br /><br />Uruguay is generally seen as the most stable, prosperous, competently managed country in S.America. I don&#039;t know about secret banking. Getting a job depends more on having a visa and speaking Spanish.<br /><br />Be wary of Asian countries if your a libertarian. Yes, you can do what you want in many places, if you have the money to bribe officials. This isn’t true freedom because you have to buy it, it’s not afforded to native poor people. This lack of due process can also be turned against you, if you piss off someone with some power. <br /><br />In many places in S.E. Asia, it’s like you are the chick, women will try to game you all day. Also know they have a moderate rate of HIV infection there.

				SW Mexico. Oaxaca or Chiapas are the states I&#039;d recommend. I could hook you up with some connections there, depending on what you want to do for a living. I&#039;m going there to live as soon as my government stops extorting child support and alimony from me.
