				Food, being necessary for the general health and wellbeing of individuals within any given society, should be provided free at the point of delivery.<br />The costs of this would be met through general taxation and the government would be ultimately responsible for the production, quality control and distribution of said foodstuffs.<br />The government would be able to outsource parts of the operation to other organizations/companies as necessary, but the government would exercise complete control over policy, procedure and all other conceivable aspects of the distribution of food.<br /><br />Why should we accept that the rich dine on the finest cuisine known to man while the rest of us are stuck with food that can barely nourish an infant?<br /><br />Having the government create a department that will undertake the management of the production and distribution of food will make sure everyone can have a decent meal, even the poorest among us. Let&#039;s call it the &quot;National Food Service&quot;.<br /><br />Never again will we unknowingly eat horse labelled as beef .<br />No one will go hungry.<br />No one will eat too much.<br /><br />Everyone&#039;s happy. Win.Win.Win.<br /><br />No?<br /><br />Discuss.

				I would be very against the government being in complete control of my food. While I&#039;m sure we are all aware and agree that government is the paragon of efficiency, a slight fuck-up in the bureaucracy could leave a family, a city, a state, or some other region without food. Nothing that is essential to life should be anywhere near the control of the government; I don&#039;t want them deciding when I eat or when I starve.

				Everyone seems to have decent ideas and just reading through all of this makes me think I&#039;m watching Food Inc. for the thousandth time, and if you haven&#039;t seen it watch it. It would be nice if most countries had a &quot;perfect system&quot; in place for food regulation and aid for those who need it, but it will never happen. Lucius mentioned the EBT system, holy fuck do I know a whole bunch of single mothers and families who definitely need it but way too many people are abusing it to withdraw cash, buy cigarettes, energy drinks, and sometimes even alcohol at places when they should be using it to provide decent meals for themselves or for their families. As for the fluoride, it wouldn&#039;t be necessary if people just used a decent tooth paste, had a decent diet, and just took care of themselves. Someone is always going to be out there to feed the agencies, politicians, and consumers with biased and faked studies to make a profit. Unfortunately it is easier to make a profit off of unhealthy, cheaply made products when there is a lobbyist filling someone&#039;s pocket or a company emptying their own pockets in court to make those who speak up, go flat broke.

				As far as government being in charge of food supply, with all due respects, bad idea.&nbsp; Big corporations that have already made moves to control the food supply are already embedded in the government via bought politicians.&nbsp; These big corporations do experiments with seeds, growing hybrid and mutated plants.&nbsp; Giant labs are set up that mimic an environment where plants are genetically altered to produce more larger fruit, but the effects on the human body have yet to be fully discovered.&nbsp; So if government controlled our food, these corporations would actually be doing it and government would protect them with total monopoly, possibly making it illegal to grow and raise your own food, because once government gains control of something, they only want more.

				There are plenty of european subsidies driving down the price of food.<br /><br />And when you look at it realistically, supermarket food is just dirt cheap. The minimum wage here is around 7 euro&#039;s an hour nett. For one hours wage you could easily buy the ingredients for a asufficient meal at ay supermarket. And it doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;ll have to eat shit either, it&#039;ll buy you 200 grams for decent meat, a heap of potatos and some veggiest quite easily.<br /><br />Realistically working for one hour a day will feed you up to and far beyond WHO recommended intake of major foodstuffs.<br /><br />The cost of housing, however, is another matter, as as the prices for fuel and such. Things like rent or mortgage are fixed expenses, and the budget for food is whatever is left over after that. I would say that the problem is not that food is expensive at all, just that the cost of all those other things are so high some people are simply left without money for food. This obviously is a sad situation in any western country, but it is the truth: people are not paying all that much for food, they just have no money left to pay for it due to housing, energy, taxes and such costs.
