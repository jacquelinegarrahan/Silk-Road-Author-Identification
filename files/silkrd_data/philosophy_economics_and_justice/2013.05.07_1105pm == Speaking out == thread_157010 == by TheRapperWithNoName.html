				all and especially to the captain roberts<br /><br />i made a post earlier today in off topic. i know cross-posting is generally frowned upon by mods. but i would like to post it here with some additional thoughts before I copypasta.<br /><br />since posting this this morning, i feel set free. <br /><br />i am from the uk. it is tiny country with a massive population compressed in a medium sized number of super dense areas. <br /><br />we are the most surveiled state by official figures in terms of cctv in europe, we have anpr everywhere, cops with cams, tv shows with police with high power evos and dramatic music when they catch a criminal with a gram of weed.<br /><br />then we have the love pentagon between the press, the police, the banks, the nhs and the government, which has been so close to being fully exposed here over the last few years. its just a shame each set of problems did not occur simultaneously. <br /><br />i hate suffering. change is by function is uncomfortable for humans seeking lower and lower states of expedition. but this country. man. <br /><br />we are controlled here by technology and media, or rather the fear that the ideas, content and symbols that those things represent.<br /><br />as such, no one who is actively choosing a life of substance enjoyment, or choosing to be a fully functional heroin addict, or choosing to explore the side of their own mind, their own life itself...<br /><br />no one is speaking.<br /><br />we write and we hide. we have people who speak out with their voice but they are usually coming from different angles. ex users. drug agency &quot;specialists&quot;. advisers to government.<br /><br />please excuse the cheesy tone of this following copypasta, but i would like your feedback on both the track (even if hip-hop aint your thing - listen to the words - headphones and weed and loud) and what i am doing.<br /><br />http://www.mediafire.com/file/upcag1u3jirca6q/SR-HTR.mp3<br /><br />15mb, 10 mins, vbr standard from 24 bit<br /><br />i know it is going to piss people off - but if we don&#039;t start a grassroots, mass dialogue on this subject, we will continue to be steamrolled by every re-labeled neo-con with any traction, followed by a dithering bunch of lying, compromising idiots in back.<br /><br />and feedback as to how i can make this better. mediafire is not going to cut it. <br /><br />and no, my voice doesn&#039;t sound like that in real life.<br /><br />be real fucking cool if it did though.<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br />Hash: SHA256<br /><br />CLEARNET LINK: http://www.mediafire.com/file/upcag1u3jirca6q/SR-HTR.mp3<br /><br />greetings<br /><br />im a rapper. i dont have a name hence the login.<br /><br />i am a vendor here on sr and though we turn over a fair amount of stock, recent events have given us and many others a real kicking.<br /><br />if it were about money i would quit right now but im here for the revolution. and to that cause i give:<br /><br />my sound and my voice<br /><br />- ---- presenting ----<br /><br />The First Song About SR, Written by an SR Vendor, Given Away to the SR People and.....<br /><br /><br />(TO THE RECORDING INDUSTRY --- YOU ARE THE PIRATES, THE RAPISTS AND MURDERERS OF MUSIC:<br />rubbin&#039; it in the face of rec execs heads,<br />&#039;cos i except the cheques from donations instead<br />your industry went down its knees but you<br />wouldnt admit your error so now youre goin&#039; down on me)<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br /><br />CLEARNET LINK: http://www.mediafire.com/file/upcag1u3jirca6q/SR-HTR.mp3<br /><br /><br /><br />DONATE:<br /><br />1FrRXyt7gcg75MBcbb3R93bDNrNZ7dDwNJ<br /><br /><br />the 1st reason for this: i need the money or i lose my place and the little business i have here goes under, so i am considering this an exchange for all those who want to join in.<br /><br />im on the verge of some not so good stuff in real life and really this skill is the only other thing i can do that people seem to like.<br /><br />if you enjoy it, send me an amount of BTC that reflects how much you enjoyed it.<br /><br />if you didnt, then thats cool. different strokes for different folks, but we&#039;re starting here.<br /><br />if you think this is cheeky/dangerous/volatile/risky, yeah, i know. i&#039;ve been wracking my brain for an alternative, but there ain&#039;t no j o b for me, despite a million cvs.<br /><br />so risk assessed and minimised, but bound to piss some people off. i acknowledge that.<br /><br /><br /><br />the 2nd reason:<br /><br />I AM A REVOLUTIONARY. if i did what i do here on the road in the circusmtances in which i do it for money alone i think my heart would break.<br /><br />we are here to change the world and the next step beyond war, even if it happens to be against an inanimate object or a conceptual enemy as opposed to a nation, is honest dialogue (which we can&#039;t have traditionally due to our countries masterful control of fear via the power of language).<br /><br />artistic expression is always the most honest and therefore the first step in that, whether that is a banksy mural pointing out the rich/poor divide, or a corporals private war journal from 1918.<br /><br />but remember: there was a reason that gerry adams voice was not allowed on television. the voice communicates with words. words have power. the means to meaning and the annunciation of truth to those who perceive it (to bastardize the v for vendetta script).<br /><br />no one on our side is speaking up. yes, we can write. yes, we have people who WERE involved (or who are here, but aren&#039;t SR&#039;ers) out there talking. yes of course you can talk about it (as long as it is commercially sanctioned so when prof green speaks about drugs, we all know he doesnt ever really do that shit.......)<br /><br />the voice is important because it can directly interact with emotions. the power of the human voice is undeniable in its ability to communicate change in people. and we desperately desperately need that.<br /><br />its a small step, but we start here.<br /><br />i give my voice, for what it is. im a bit of a squeeky bastard. dont seen to matter too much though.<br /><br />the track is made mostly from samples of Ray Charles, &quot;Hit The Road&quot;, totally mangled of course ^-^<br /><br />91 bpm, hip hop, pretty raw and probably not everyones cup of tea.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />download it, let me know what you think.<br /><br /><br />CLEARNET LINK: http://www.mediafire.com/file/upcag1u3jirca6q/SR-HTR.mp3<br /><br /><br />if you enjoy it and have btc that you would like to donate to the cause, the donation address is:<br /><br />1FrRXyt7gcg75MBcbb3R93bDNrNZ7dDwNJ<br /><br />(put it this way. if you enjoy it so much that you want me to make more, invest in me and i will invest it back into what i am doing. ive spent that last 24 hours solid doing this and that is time away from the people important to me.)<br /><br />whether you love it, hate it, adore it, want to smash it, sign it, burn it... whatever, when you download it, you will have my highest gratitude.<br /><br /><br />so thats it - PM me here if you wish to chat.<br /><br /><br />my tormail address is trwnn@tormail.org<br /><br />since it aint very reliable, sr forums are better.<br /><br />much peace, love and respect to everyone on each side of this sham of a war.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The obligatory PGP key:<br /><br />- -----BEGIN PGP
