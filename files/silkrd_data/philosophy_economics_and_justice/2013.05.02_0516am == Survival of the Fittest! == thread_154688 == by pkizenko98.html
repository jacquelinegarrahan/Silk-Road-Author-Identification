				If you see survival of the fittest in terms of race and not individuals, then sure.<br /><br />But then, what sense does it make at all?

It&#039;s a meaningless phrase the way I see it, because it is so general it can mean basically anything - and thus there is nothing to debate.<br /><br />How would you define fittest?

				I usually hate T.V. but, I watched &#039;The Walking dead&#039; and it gave me some good lessons on this subject. The governor, even with all his resources and obvious upper hand wasn&#039;t able to realistically penetrate Rick&#039;s defenses at the prison. The gov&#039; said, &quot;In this world, you kill, or you die. Or you die, then you kill.&quot; Or something to that effect. I believe it is true that the idea of liberty has greatly improved life for every individual, but there are always people who know this basic rule of the jungle still is in place. It must be taught to the people trained to give their life for their country. Psychology and uniforms are put in place so you kill these people and not the other ones. Why? The gov. murdered his entire crew for being green... In a situation of resource scarceness, in this case courage in the final ep. the boss decides to radically change his plan of the idea of individual&#039;s rights in his group. Taking most but not all of his groups lives was a decision to survive and be the fittest. Even Rick&#039;s son understands as he guns down another surrendering child. I read today on reddit that when aging mother kittens become sick from nursing they kill their young. When the resources of earth become depleted, which they are, have faith that the powers that be will not continue to pay for everyone to live. In my opinion depopulation is already happening. There are a lot more people now but the general science stays the same I guess.&nbsp; I like this sub forum!!!

				I do not believe in good or bad.<br /><br />Survival of those who survive would be a more fitting term then. I believe in determinism and as such, chance has no place in my world-view. To quote Stephen Hawkings; &quot;The initial configuration of the universe may have been chosen by God, or it may itself have been determined by the laws of science. In either case, it would seem that everything in the universe would then be determined by evolution according to the laws of science, so it is difficult to see how we can be masters of our fate.&quot;<br /><br />Thus I would have to phrase it like this; Survival of those with an initial configuration of coincidences which last longest. If we consider it as our matter surviving and not our life (consciousness), we are immortal star dust. Might sound a bit far-fetched, but that&#039;s how I see it.

				I think you misunderstand.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying man is without will, I&#039;m saying man cannot control his will - initially. That means you are born to this world - determined by your heritage - you continue through this world controlled by how this heritage react to its environment.

Leary tried DMT, even injected it, and started off with psilocybin, but always said LSD was best. I never &#039;got&#039; it until I accidentally did a large dose (usual number of blotter tabs, but much stronger blotter than I was used to), probably around +400ug, and actually experienced the things he documented in &#039;The Psychedelic Experience: A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead&#039;. It was a stunning and life-changing experience. But if you do you have to be ready/willing to let go of ego - it&#039;s fighting against that that will give you a bad experience...

				It all dependents on what you believe. And what you believe is based on what you know or think is true. And what you believe to be true is based on the evidence you have to support your point. Then you might be wrong and misunderstood the fact. If so how open would you be to the possibility that you are wrong.<br />The are you asking the right question. And are you willing to accept the answer even if the go against you desire.
