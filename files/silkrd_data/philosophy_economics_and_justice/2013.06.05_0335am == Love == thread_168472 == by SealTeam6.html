(especially from a drug dealer) ;) - Just a joke, not a &#039;dig&#039;. <br /><br />It seems like more and more, I see posts putting down people who believe in God. While I never stopped, (though I&#039;ve had my doubts at times) I don&#039;t go trying to put those down that have decided to be agnostic, or are pushing atheism. Yet you will probably hear from a few on this thread. <br /><br />I say &#039;good for you&#039;! That&#039;s awesome that you feel that way, and are pushing a positive message. Even just the message about Love. Without bringing God into it, is a positive contribution to all of us. <br /><br />It&#039;s something that seems to be being pushed further and further away from the younger generation. This new secularism, mostly pushed by far left radicals that have infiltrated academia, as far as the US goes, anyway. Yet there is this bending over backwards for Muslims, by the same left wing crowd. It&#039;s as if the terrorist attacks have actually had an impact on these people! In the same way a bully gets &#039;respect&#039;, when all it is,&nbsp; is cowardice and fear of repercussions if they don&#039;t kiss up to them. <br /><br />So while Christian bashing, and antisemitism, are all the rage. You have a society suffering a collective Stockholm Syndrome in regard to radical Islam. <br /><br />It&#039;s quite sad. <br /><br />Love is the answer. <br /><br />Unfortunately many can&#039;t see that. <br /><br />Peace brother.&nbsp;

				I know what you are saying Southpaw, love is multifaceted, there are different types I mean, love for friends and family, romantic love, what have you. Embrace what youve got even if its just friends or family and be there for the ones you love. The best advice anyone ever gave me was to do all that I can for all my brothers and sisters, may sound corny to some, but its damn good advice. What else can we really do anyhow to make a difference? Its much easier to wage wars and shit than it is to actually love someone. Hate is easy, love takes work. And while you say you dont know much about it, you probably know more than you give yourself credit for my friend. Loving this thread btw.
