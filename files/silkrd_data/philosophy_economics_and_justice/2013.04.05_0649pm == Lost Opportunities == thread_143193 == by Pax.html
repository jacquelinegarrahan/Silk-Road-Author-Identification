				I see a large collection of lost opportunities. A chemical is made and used for a few years then it is banned by a new law or the analog act or as I would like it to be know &quot;The Lost Opportunities. Because as soon as it is made illegal all of the research stops and all of the benifts Lost from humanity.I could list them all but their are so many. If any one knows of any research being done on these new chemicals please let me know where? And how I can contribute Peace,Love and many good vibes.&nbsp;

				i was babysitting my 8yo niece and she came out of the shower in just a towel and sat on my lap and i was like, holy shit what if she tells her mom so i didnt do anything, now thats a lost opportunity, luckily she came out in her panties later that night and we started wrestling and i got hard as a rock so she notices and play innocent and grabs it like she doesnt know, so i hold her down and start grinding my cock against her tiny pussy and she lets out this little yelp and what&nbsp; happend from there would take a bit of fabric softner and some stain remover to fix

It was supposed to be about research chemicals and how they are pumped out,Made illegal,lost forever and then we restart the process. How in the hell we got on the conversation of child molestation is beyond me. I call TROLL Lol and the best thing to do is ignore so back to the topic at hand &quot;Research Chemicals&quot;
