				It is my opinion that all of the major economies of the world are verging on complete and total economic collapse. This may sound alarmist, but the signs are in the news everyday. I think this event will happen soon, and once it begins, it will be very rapid.<br /><br />Consider the following<br /><br />- The sovereign (government) debt of the US, Britain, France, Japan and many other countries only goes up. These governments can’t even live within their means, every year they add to the debt. The idea that governments may actually borrow no money, and in addition save money to pay back some of the debt is absurd, it’s not going to happen. Is this sustainable?<br /><br />- Japan has government debt now approaching 250% of GDP (over 1 quadrillion Yen). <br />Japan spends a quarter of it’s tax revenue on interest payments. Total debt is about 24 times government revenue.<br />The current interest rate they borrow new money at (the 10 year bond yield for example) about 0.7%. This is basically the only rate they can afford. If this interest rate goes up to even 3% (it is set by the free market so it can), the debt repayment exceeds government revenue, and Japan is finished.<br /><br />- In 2008 the US had 825 billion dollars in circulation, and it took 200 years to build the monetary base up to this. After the 2008 financial crash this monetary base exploded and as of 21st of August 2013 it is 3.3 trillion dollars. That is four times as much currency.<br /><br />- The Euro had about 420 billion units of currency in existence at it’s launch in 1999. As of mid 2012 that had increased to 1.7 trillion euros.<br /><br />I could go on. These are just a few random example of incredible financial instability from around the world. We are used to unimportant, poor economies collapsing (Zimbabwe), but if a major trading economy collapses it will effect the whole world. If they all collapse simultaneously it will produce an economic tsunami.<br /><br />All fiat currencies inflate until their value reaches zero. There is not a single historical example of a successful fiat currency, eventually they all fail.<br /><br />One more ominous sign that we are in the end game now came up last week. The US central bank (Federal Reserve) currently creates $85 billion of new money every month to prop the economy up (quantitative easing). Last week it was supposed to begin reducing that amount (tapering). It was suggested that they may taper by $15 billion, only printing $70 billion per month. Or maybe just a token $5 billion taper just to ease the markets into this. They didn’t taper at all. They couldn’t even reduce the amount new money they magic up into thin air by a token amount, because this is the only thing that is stopping total collapse. <br /><br />They have created a Ponzi scheme that they cannot escape from, and they will continue printing money until it is worthless. And they are not the only government doing this.<br /><br />Economic collapses can happen very quickly. The day before a collapse is just another day, people find it difficult to imagine anything other than the reality they already know. Economics and financial markets are obscure and hidden behind technical language, and so most people don’t see this coming.<br /><br />I am going to continue posting threads on this subject, bringing awareness to it, and talking about how you can protect yourself, and even profit from what is about to happen.

				I have a great interest in this area, though I have slightly mixed feelings about the OP; it points out how debt is growing, it points out that the amount of currency units is growing, it doesn&#039;t make the logical link between the two - ALL currency represents a debt. If everyone paid off all their debts there would be no currency (but still rather alot of debt due to interest obligations).<br /><br />TBH, I&#039;m not all that worried about currency inflation as a currency unit and how much that unit will buy you is pretty arbitrary, as should be obvious to anyone watching bitcoin - it&#039;s really (at that level) just a way of comparing the &#039;value&#039; of different and otherwise incomparable commodities.<br /><br />What I do find concerning is that the current fiat currency system is piss-poor at fair and reasonable allocation of resources, since there is no token anywhere that represents &#039;wealth&#039;, only tokens of debt. And I think that it these terms under which we need to think of money; as a way to allocate resources.<br /><br />Think of it this way - we have 7bn+ people of the planet, each of who has varying degrees of ability to work and different skills, but each of who needs to be allocated some resources; food, water, shelter, healthcare, utilities, materials &amp; tools required for both home and professional life, etc. At the same time there are limits on the resources available; finite amounts of food prodcued each year, finite amounts of clean water at any moment, only so many houses and only so many houses that can be built, only so many people that can receive a given level of healthcare, only so much gas or electricity, only so much bandwidth, only so much metal in the ground and only so much that can be mined at once, only so many smartphones that can be manufactured, etc....<br /><br />So the question is - how do you engineer a self-governing economic system/mechanism that a) ensures that everyone has a minimum allocation of resources to live (so, for instance, that they don&#039;t have a basic biological imperative to steal resources from other. I suspect there will be some disagreement as to what is &#039;minimum&#039;), b) is &#039;fair&#039; about allocation of resources (I guess people will differ on what they consider to be &#039;fair&#039;. To me it means &#039;not disproportional to the amount of effort you put in&#039;, so people wouldn&#039;t make huge sums for very little at the expense of people who work extremely hard for proportionally much less) and lastly c) so that resources are managed to the extent that their use is sustainable into the indefinite future? I have a few ideas, but mostly I don&#039;t really know (although it&#039;s c) that, surprisingly, causes the most problems). But I think we can all agree that the current &#039;central bank fiat currency&#039; system is failing on all counts...<br /><br />Back to the original collapse question - I don&#039;t think there will be a collapse, there are too many vested interests. And after all, all this fiat currency is totally make-believe numbers in a database, so it can keep on expanding ad infinitum really, they just have to create a new denomination, say, a hyper-doller, worth 100 or 1000 dollars, so that dollars become like cents, and suddenly the numbers are more manageable.... I think an ecological collapse will happen first...<br /><br />Anyhow, I look forward to future threads!

But I think we can all agree that the current &#039;central bank fiat currency&#039; system is failing on all counts...</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>There are so many problems it&#039;s quite hard to even think about it.<br /><br />A minimum-income system is in place in many European countries (and I think the US also has something in slightly different form). The only people who get nothing in the current system are those who chose to do nothing. (who generally end like bums)<br /><br />An alternative system would be one where everybody gets an income, a basic income: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income<br /><br />This system makes pensions, minimum wages, most if not al forms of welfare etc all obsolete. Simply everybody gets a small sum that is sufficient to pay rent, stay warm and buy food (and depending on definitions, buy health insurance) but that&#039;s it. I personally like the idea of that system, but don&#039;t see it happening anytime soon. It would fix both points A and B pretty much.<br /><br />Also we should probably have never given up on the golden standard. Possibly the economy would have been slower to grow, but would that actually have been a problem? And companies and organizations should have probably been limited in size. No single company, be it a bank, software company or butcher, should ever become SO big they are &quot;too big to fail&quot;. This should have never happened in the first place. This still leaves governments as &quot;too big to fail&quot; (one could wonder if we should split up countries to prevent that), but governments generally could be alright as long as they don&#039;t do anything stupid (sadly, we know that&#039;s just a dream).<br /><br />Lastly there is C. I&#039;m thinking the biggest problem comes from evolution. Two things: we think short-term. We don&#039;t have the kind of brain that can really look 40 years ahead, let alone 400 years, and actually _care_. I see a few men who do care and usually they are people I suspect have used psychedelics and/or have been in space and have looked at the earth from up there. And strangely I find myself here too, but I&#039;ve been in a strange situation. Also, there are probably others. Spending a few years in solitary may very well do the job for some people. This has nothing to do with IQ, btw. Plenty clever people don&#039;t see it.<br /><br />I do distinguish between people who actually care and those who just say they do. If you unplug your television instead of leaving it in standby (savings: &lt;1 watt for a recent LCD) but you fly to your holiday destination, buy a new phone every 2 years and still have lightbulbs, fuck you. You don&#039;t give a shit about anything, you&#039;re just doing something that relieves you of your guilt.<br /><br />Second, still evolution. We need more, bigger and better. We don&#039;t want a new car ourselves, we want a new car because the neighbour has one. You don&#039;t really need a new phone, but all your colleagues have one, so you can&#039;t stay behind? And don&#039;t forget about the women. I once heard the saying &quot;If a man could fuck in a cardboard box, he would have never bothered to start building a house&quot;. There may be some truth in that. Be honest, if your wardrobe was crap, if you didn&#039;t have a car and lived in the ghetto, how many women are you going to date? Still a positive number? How many if you lived in the woods? Zilch? My point exactly.<br /><br />The solution? I don&#039;t have one. We naturally consume all resources until we run out. If by then science has not yet found a technological solution (or we have all been killed by some kind of new black plague), we&#039;ll be royally screwed.<br /><br />I predict World War 3 in some 20-100 years. Probably not sooner (but I could be wrong). If it doesn&#039;t happen in the next 100 years, there will be a chance we have developed and installed nuclear fusion reactors worldwide, rendering energy near-free. This will also enable cradle-to-cradle recycling (much easier when energy is cheap). It will also make the base income completely possible, removing some reasons to commit crime.<br /><br />And hopefully in 100 years we will have seen the light and have very lenient drug laws, further reducing crime. When this happens, many more people should be able to gain the insights we so badly need. If all this happens, World War 3 could be off the table for thousands of years.<br /><br />What should we do right now? Two things:<br /><br />1. People need to start voting for pro-drug parties and they have to legalize everything. The &quot;war on drugs&quot; is just too damn expensive, funds organized crime and corruption and hurts human beings. It needs to stop, right now. This is not sustainable. People should also vote for anti-copyright parties. Copyright just limits our culture and creativity. Without those things, how are humans different from dogs? Crime reduction is essential and as long as we are chasing potheads and single mothers who download crappy music using p2p, we can forget about lasting peace.<br />2. We need to start building nuclear fission reactors, fast. Tons of &#039;em. Do what the French did. Don&#039;t worry about the waste: future reactors will be able to use the waste of the current reactors as fuel. Research towards building reactors that use thorium for fuel also needs to be accelerated: it&#039;s abundant. But right now, we need to start building. If we started *now* we could have enough nuclear fission reactors in place to make fossil fuels obsolete before we ever run out. Running out means war. Nuclear fission should be able to last until we have either nuclear fusion or enough solar/wind energy.<br /><br />Here&#039;s what will really happen:<br /><br />At some point the economy will collapse. I really can&#039;t predict when this will happen or what the size of the catastrophe will be, but economists are saying that we really haven&#039;t done enough to prevent another crisis. We will keep drilling for oil so we can drive stupid cars to the supermarket and manufacture our throwaway-gadgets and when that runs out, we&#039;ll use coal. The climate will go to hell. When the economy goes to hell (be it because we run out of fuel or because the economy itself breaks), people will be poor and start voting for racist parties. The racist parties, once they have a majority, start wars.<br /><br />And after everything has been burned to the ground, the ashes will be the soil for a new civilization.

				Thank you for starting this thread. Here&#039;s my contribution (reposted):<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206731.msg1532335#msg1532335<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">There is only one way and really only one way for libertarianism to take hold: collapse.<br /><br />Let me say that again so you get me: COLLAPSE.<br /><br />That means collapse of the dollar to start. Collapse of the monopoly and absolute power of the federal reserve and the government to force people to use the dollar and other state-sponsored currencies. Collapse of the ability of government to collect income tax. Collapse of the ability of government to print unlimited amounts of debt on the backs of the people. Collapse of the ability of government to partner up with corporations because they&#039;re just too small to do it anymore. And collapse of government period.<br /><br />The current state of affairs is driven by a devastating series of events which happened nearly 100 years ago. And they all happened one after another over a short span of time: creation of the federal reserve, creation of the income tax, creation of the first food and drugs act, exacting heavy penalties for &quot;treason&quot; against the government, and of course the prohibition of drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />A protestant religious movement seized control of policy in America back then. They were obsessed with central planning and making sure that &quot;you are your brother&#039;s keeper&quot; no matter the cost. The masses were considered either too stupid, too weak or too poor to think and act for themselves and therefore needed government to take care of them. They thought that laws made men good and oversaw the largest expansion of government ever up to that point. It didn&#039;t help that the eugenics movement was still in full swing, racism was very high and many forms of socialism were sweeping across the entire globe at the time.<br /><br />The government&#039;s REAL power is derived from only two of those things: the ability to collect income tax through any means necessary and to issue debt through the private federal reserve central bank backed by the income tax. Nearly unlimited amounts of debt since the money supply is grossly distorted through this process and the government can do pretty much anything to get its money. The income tax is the basis for our modern surveillance state and money laundering laws. The thing is that I did say &quot;nearly&quot; unlimited and not just unlimited since NOTHING is unlimited and a collapse will follow. The only question is when.<br /><br />I give it another 7 or 8 years. Definitely less than a decade. The economy will collapse along with the dollar. The size of government will reach a certain breaking point and will implode when it loses the ability to collect income tax. Default will follow. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be part of the mechanism which makes this possible.<br /><br />I know you may not want to hear it but everything is governed by cycles and natural law and government WILL become a lot smaller after growing to an unimaginable nightmarish size. You can&#039;t stop it. You just have to adapt to it. Make your own decisions, think your own thoughts and help yourself and your own family and friends instead of expecting others to do all this for you. You have some time to think about this stuff. Just don&#039;t say that no one warned you when it comes. Detroit is only the beginning.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s coming. You can&#039;t stop it. It took 220 years (1776-1996) to print $5 trillion of debt. And less than 4 years under Obama&#039;s first term to print another $5 trillion. I don&#039;t think it takes a genius to figure out what the disastrous consequences of that and taking up even more debt will be.

Gold is fucking useless (except for in manufacturing electronics), and it&#039;s a totally arbitrary way to govern the economy, not least because it instantly puts into a position of power those who&#039;ve hoarded nazi gold. I&#039;d rather we were put on the grain-standard, or the food-standard, or something that is a) useful and b) that has a finite shelf-life. I think a shelf-life is important as any &#039;wealth&#039; that get&#039;s created with money is likely to deteriorate over time. Money needs to (somehow) be created and removed so that at any given moment the money represents the &#039;wealth&#039; available....<br /><br />I agree fission reactors are a good idea. James Lovelock sold me on that...

				&nbsp; &nbsp; The current world economic system, the one we all fear is on the verge of collapse,&nbsp; is one that has been carefully crafted by a group of extremely intelligent&nbsp; people, over the past 150 years, and who have succeeded in gaining almost complete control of &quot;western society&#039;s finances&quot;,&nbsp; but also a large chunk of the East&#039;s resources as well<br /><br />&nbsp;As&nbsp; Mayer. Amschel. Rockerfeller&nbsp; said back in&nbsp; (IIRC) the 1840&#039;s,&nbsp; <br />&quot;Give me control of a Nations money supply and I care not who makes it&#039;s laws&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; It was the Rockefeller and the Rothschild families, who had om many an occaision,&nbsp; provided the finance needed by various kings and queens who wished to go to war (e.g. The Opium Wars, Boer War etc, in fact it was WW1 which turmed out to be a HUGE success for the banksters, who made a killing, from all the killing and destruction, and as all the property of the men who had died in the war,&nbsp; dead men with no wills and family&nbsp; became the banks!&nbsp; They couldn;t go wrong!<br /><br />&nbsp; And once they had all the money they could spend in 50 lifetimes, their &#039;desires&#039; turned to having &#039;power&#039; over others, and this power corrupts their thinking and feelings, and the ugliness you see in this world is the projections of their souls on the streets, in comparison pick a nice sydney or mebourne street! \\]4<br /><br />&nbsp; One curious hangover of days gone by, was that the Master of the House, was seen to have a responsibility for the general health and welfare of &quot;their servants&quot;&nbsp; and the others who lived on their Landlords holdings in various capacites,<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Up until recently, I saw few alternatives to this brilliantly constructed hedgemony, built over generations by people who would eventually control the lions share of the WORLDS&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;resources AND money supplies&quot;<br /><br />&nbsp; I have finally come to see that&nbsp; THERE IS A WAY OUT!&nbsp; WE CAN REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE .....&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;How,&nbsp; you may ask ?&nbsp; It&#039;s easier than you think!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing is, we talk about it, we make it the main topic of our conversations and we try and learn more about what is happening and what kind of things we might be able to do,&nbsp; especially of we get together, and we&nbsp; ALREADY ARE, here online, and it;s not a huge step to RL!<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;United we stand, divided we fall&quot;&nbsp; .....&nbsp; there are cunts out there who would love to see us ALL fall, but IF we learn to recognize each&nbsp; other, we can help each other and if we are genuine, &quot;we. the people&quot; WILL BECOME A FORCE TO BE RECOGNIzED AND RESPECTED WITH<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; FIRSTLY;&nbsp; &nbsp; &#039;We&nbsp; MUST&nbsp; BEGIN&nbsp; TO&nbsp; TALK&nbsp; BOUT&nbsp; ALL&nbsp; THESE&nbsp; PROBLEMS&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Discussion is ALWAYS where actions begin,<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;Through our thoughts, we develop actions, which we may, Or may not &#039;act upon&#039; ....

or &quot;socialism&quot; OR&nbsp; &#039;democracy &#039; or ANY&nbsp; OTHER&#039;&nbsp; &#039;ism&#039; or&nbsp; ANY other &quot;political system&quot; ... <br />BECOZ ....<br />there IS ONLY ONE RULER, <br />&nbsp;the&nbsp; Golden Ruler ... you know the Golden Rule ...,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;He who has the gold makes the rules&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.... and &#039;who&#039; has the gold these days?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;The Global Financiers of course, that&#039;s &quot;who&quot; ... and do you think that Bear Stearns or Goldman Sachs or Deutsche Bank or The Bank of America , Bernie Maddox, and colleagues,&nbsp; GIVE ONE MILLI FUCK , as to who they do business with, and the political beliefs of their clients?&nbsp; &nbsp;Nup!&nbsp; Not One!<br /><br />ALL they care about is the &#039;bottom line&#039; aka PROFITS!<br /><br />&nbsp; And neither do ANY of those &quot;too big to fail&quot; companies like GM, Ford (who the fuck NEEDS a new car every 2-3 years anyway?) care about you or me?<br /><br />&nbsp; These guys are totally ruthless sociopaths, interested in controlling the World!<br />&nbsp; And seriously,&nbsp; HOW can these dudes justify their massive salaries when their companies are going bankrupt?<br /><br />&nbsp; Becoz the sheeple &quot;let them&quot;&nbsp; why not after all... but, tbh,&nbsp; most people&nbsp; have NO idea what they possibly can do to change the &#039;status quo&#039; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;And the &#039;majority&#039; shareholders usually don&#039;t want changes when the profits are rolling in?!<br /><br />Can anyone tell me what Smith and Wesson or Remington or the like, would DO IF they were TOLD they could no longer make gus?&nbsp; <br />Or if ANY of the companies which make up a huge part pf the US &quot;military-industrial machine&quot;&nbsp; (which IS a complete &quot;system&quot; that&#039;s&nbsp; FAR TO BIG TO FAIL!&nbsp; yet!<br /><br />&nbsp;I&#039;m an Australian in my 50&#039;s&nbsp; and I have watched &#039;murica slowly change from the place EVERYONE wanted to be into a place of massive inequality and dis-honest goverment agencies,&nbsp; &nbsp;and I must ask, &quot;what type of goverment&nbsp; &#039;agency&#039; not only NEEDS a budget of BILLIONS or even TRILLIONS ....<br /><br />&nbsp;BUT one that is a &quot;Black Budget!&quot;&nbsp; so much for transparency when &quot;they cant tell the public what it IS they are spending all this&nbsp; money on!<br /><br />&nbsp;And the constant talk of &quot;more jobs and growing business and increasing productivity is just MADNESS!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />These things cannot continue as they once did!&nbsp; &nbsp;INFINITE GROWTH IN BUSINESS IS A FALLACY,it just cannot happen ad infinitum!<br /><br />THINGS NEED TO CHANGE ....&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But what things CAN?&quot; you say?&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Until recently,&nbsp; I too had&nbsp; been overwhelmed by the apparent size of the world&#039;s current financial woes,&nbsp; and there were no very &#039;useful/effective&#039;&nbsp; answers or alternatives to the current economic madness prevailing on the planet<br /><br />... I didn&#039;t have many answers either,&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;UNTIL, <br />&nbsp; thanks to some great minds and the advent of technology, specifically the &quot;communications revolution&quot; which includes the Interwebz! <br /><br />&nbsp; The ONE THING the &quot;elite&quot; failed to take into account&nbsp; --- the tool that allows us to share information and co-ordinate ourselves<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NOW, WHAT CAN WE DO?<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;WE CAN DO SOMETHINGS TO HELP BEGIN THE REPAIRS to&nbsp; SPACESHIP&nbsp; &nbsp;EARTH&nbsp; .....&nbsp; here are some ideas.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;SCARCITY &quot; IS&nbsp; AN&nbsp; &#039;ILLUSION&#039; ...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There IS MORE THAN ENOUGH &quot;everything&quot; to feed clothe, house and educate and provide Health Care for EVERYONE ON THE PLANET!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;To do so would cost less than the&nbsp; amount congress approves for the military, and this DOES NOT INCLUDE &quot;Black Ops&quot;. the specifics we know VERY little about but we DO know we spend HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of&nbsp; DOLLARS on &quot;Military actions&quot; they not only wont tell you about, they dont even admit they are there, amd yet they ask congress for several hundred BILLION dollars EACH YEAR to do things they dont want to tell you about,&nbsp; so they dont!,they create diversions like shootings and bombings that do little harm, relatively<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just like the many famous &#039;bullshit advertising campaaigns&#039;&nbsp; ....like&nbsp; &quot;Coke adds Life&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;Diamonds are Forever&quot; ! <br />And they are expensive becoz, they are VERY RARE and hard to find!&nbsp; &nbsp;Plus &quot;chicks love them&quot; becoz buying a diamond&nbsp; ring for your girl&nbsp; &quot;proves&quot;&nbsp; your love for her!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; TPTB LOVED TV as they could push their messages as to what the &quot;perfect husband/wife/lifestyle was desirable! <br />&nbsp;The recent TV show,&nbsp; &quot;MadMen&quot;, the one about the advertising industry, and the people&#039;s&nbsp; aspirations, lifestyles and attitudes of the avante garde of&nbsp; the early 1960, just before JFK<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The world IS NOT &#039;running out&#039; of resources we Need to survive, BUT, we ARE WASTING HUGE AMOUNTS ALL THE TIME<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THIS MUST BE REDUCED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE<br /><br />&nbsp;IDEA #1 ... Manufacturing can now be almost completely automated ... and It should be!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; +&gt;&nbsp; The &quot;cost&quot; of producing a widget using state of the art equipment SHOULD be the &#039;same&#039; in raw material and energy consumption (kw/h) regardless of&nbsp; the location of the plant, assuming the cost of supply of both raw materials and the &#039;energy/kw/h&#039; the&nbsp; manufacturing requires WILL BE THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHERE IT&#039;S MADE .... so<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; As R. Buckminster Fuller suggested,&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why not set prices based on the amount of energy in kilowatt hours, it takes to make the product, in total, from start to finish&quot; . . . as the &#039;cost&#039; should be the same;<br /><br />AND::. we could then &quot;appropriate&quot;&nbsp; and utilize the NSA&#039;s supercomputers to &quot;fairly ascertain and then allocate&quot;, Global resources as they are required.&nbsp; This is EXACTLY the ultimate purpose for a quantum computer at this stage in our history!<br /><br />&nbsp; These computers would&nbsp; be best used to help&nbsp; allocate and distribute all the neccesities for humans to survive, from food and shelter<br />to housing and participation!<br /><br />&nbsp; IF we were truly &#039;sensible&#039; and acted with a Vulcan&#039;s like Mr Spock&#039;s logic,&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;work&quot;&nbsp; would be something people do, BOTH as part of being a member of society and&nbsp; receiving it&#039;s benefits<br /><br />&nbsp;humans decide &#039;when, where and how&#039;&nbsp; to act in our planet&#039;s and it&#039;s inhabitants best interests<br /><br />AND THEN::&nbsp; Thanks to advances in computing power, non-centralized electronic currencies like Bitcoins,&nbsp; ARE the answer to &quot;removing&quot; the monopoly of power of the International Financial Industry <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;These organized groups with names including groups like the World Bank et al; and the many other investment groups, , such as, The Trilateral Commission, The Mafia , andmobs like The Rockerfeller Foundation, as well as a myriad of companies 99.99999% of the people of this planet have no ideas about these companies existing,&nbsp; and all their spinoffs and shelf companies that they use to operate from for a few years at a time before changing the name of the entity.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Before 911, who had ever heard of Halliburton, Global Security Solutions and G4?&nbsp; Who knew that the&nbsp; Bush family HAD A VESTED INTEREST IN WAR in the Gulf, and they MOST CERTAINLY WANTED THE OIL!!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; No-one seemed to know of this skullduggery,. and it wasn&#039;t until the first gulf war,&nbsp; that the names of&nbsp; these &quot;civilian contractors&quot; became known of to the average man on the street, who didn&#039;t give a fuck as it &quot;seemed to make No difference to them&quot; .... life went on,&nbsp; and&nbsp; &quot;The Patriot Act&quot;&nbsp; was &#039;slipped through&#039;&#039; your congress on a xmas eve! <br /><br />And I imagine VERY FEW&nbsp; americans&nbsp; are aware of the ramifications of this so called &quot;Patriot Act&quot;&nbsp; IF it were to be enacted!<br /><br />Then, at around the same time they were &quot;being sold&#039;&quot; the &#039;idea&#039; that a &quot;new group of terrorists called&nbsp; &quot;Al-qaeda&quot; (an arabic tern that literally means &quot;the (data) base&quot; ... which was a list of mujahadeen fighters who could be interested in extending their &quot;holy slaughter&quot;<br /><br /><br />fuckin great

				I was promoting a way for people/slaves to get out of slavery by using btc and sr for other reasons then to be a part in a unjust war..<br /><br />Since the day when humanity gets the service provided by vendors that enables everyone who got fiatmoney that will not be worth shit after the collapse, then why not use that money visely and end the unjust economic laws that enslaves humanity..<br /><br />That would be playing the game of life like a pro, until then lets play the game of life like noobs..<br /><br />Lets send some drugs and watch the economyy and wars tuble around us.

				And let me say it is because of my deep love for you that I call you a slave, and its the deep hate for you that makes the slaveowner not tell you that youre a slave by informing the public about how the slaveconomy works..<br /><br />I am fully aware that we have a world filled of misdirected love but I still know real humans know real love when they see it.<br /><br /><br />
