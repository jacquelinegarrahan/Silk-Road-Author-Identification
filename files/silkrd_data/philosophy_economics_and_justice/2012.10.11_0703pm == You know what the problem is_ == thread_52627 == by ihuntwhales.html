				The problem is people believing that they are owed something. Whether they believe their parents didn&#039;t give them enough, friends aren&#039;t living up to their needs, or the world is against them in general. The world is indifferent to you and your problems, the world owes you nothing! The fact that these assholes sit around and complain all day while I have watched the demise of some of the greatest and most giving people to walk this earth is repulsive.<br /><br />It&#039;s hard for someone to keep an optimistic view of things once they start to really search for the true way of things. The further down the rabbit hole you go, the more lost you seem to become. For awhile I lost a lot of faith in people, especially my current generation, who easily claims the title of most self-indulged and pompous, unappreciative assholes that have ever lived. For me, I get along with an optimistic view by not equating the powers of good and evil. There is a lot of evil out there in the world, but if you can find one truly good thing in the midst of all that nefarious bullshit, then I&#039;d have to conclude that it wasn&#039;t a wasted experience.<br /><br />So, if you&#039;re a self-absorbed, ungrateful asshole, what&#039;s the solution to the problem? Simple. Realize this: No one owes you anything in this world. No one is going to give you what you want, so get off your ass and get it yourself.

				The number one problem, in my opinion, boils down to what we as individuals choose to value in our lifetime.&nbsp; We seek things that make us feel good (a very broad, subjective category), and we stay away from things that make us feel not so good.&nbsp; The problem is the depth of consideration in undertaking the question: &quot;Does this make me feel good?&quot;.&nbsp; An example would be the decision of whether or not to drink heavily the night before your championship soccer match.&nbsp; On one level (a very shallow level), drinking that night may seem like a good decision.&nbsp; You could get a great buzz going and spend some good quality time with your friends.&nbsp; Taken at face value, this doesn&#039;t seem like that bad of a choice.&nbsp; It is when we start to consider tomorrow and the fact that our decision to drink the night before, although fun at the time, will cost us dearly in the form of a poor performance in the soccer match, it doesn&#039;t seem like such a great decision after all.&nbsp; This is especially true when you realize that holding the championship cup up after your victory provides you with a lot more happiness than the temporary buzz from a night of drinking ever could. <br /><br />The same subject can wind up having contrasting implications when considered on different levels.&nbsp; The problem is that the people, although in the back of their minds want to win the championship cup, they don&#039;t trust their teammates, and because they assume that their teammates are going to drink the night before, they feel that the game will be lost despite of the choices they make, and think &quot;Hey, nobody else cares, so I&#039;m not going to care either.&nbsp; I&#039;m going to go get drunk!&nbsp; It takes no teamwork to get drunk, and although it might not be as pleasurable as winning the championship, at least its a sure thing, and I don&#039;t need to depend on anyone else for my success.&quot;&nbsp; And what&#039;s worse is that the whole time your opponent is spreading rumors amongst your teammates, claiming that members of your team plan to drink and ditch the match!&nbsp; What winds up happening is you begin hating your teammates and they begin hating you, but its the other team that&#039;s walking away with the cup.&nbsp; People lack the foresight to invest together in the future and instead engage in a multitude of counteractive quick fixes, and then hate on one another for doing it.&nbsp; All of this results from a lack of trust (on whatever level you may choose) of your fellow man, and that&#039;s why I see the establishment and preservation of confidence and certitude in the community as the sole solution to wipe out the haters and their cause.

I agree fully that failing to value what&#039;s really important is a big problem. My theory is that the things that provide stimulanting responses (drinking, sex, getting high, ect.) provide a temporary feeling of bliss, but overall happiness is dependent on a factor most don&#039;t acknowledge.&nbsp; I strongly believe that a person overall happiness is dependent on doing the things that he doesn&#039;t really seem to enjoy doing. For example, a high school kids skips school and doesn&#039;t complete homework to go get high with his friends.&nbsp; The bliss he receives from doing this is adequate, however it is also temporary. Meanwhile, he is becoming increasingly depressed and under constant stress because of his failing grades. However, if the same kids completes all his school work and attends class, then goes out and gets stoned off his ass, then he maintains his overall happiness by reducing stress and invigorating his sense of self-worth, while also receiving the bliss from his recreational fun.<br /><br />The key is moderation! Get high, fuck to the point of a heart attack, get plastered drunk, go out and get those little bits of euphoria. However, don&#039;t forget to meet your responsibilities as well. Work hard, play hard, in that order. That&#039;s what has kept me grounded throughout my life, and after a time, the things that you viewed as chores start to become almost as fun as the reckless shit. Learning would be a great example of that, in my case.

Moderation is in short supply these days especially among the world&#039;s youth. Not everything happens in their favor at commercial break, or because it&#039;s simply &#039;expected&#039;. It seems if they don&#039;t get what they want right away they throw a&nbsp; temper tantrum in which everyone else is supposed to care about and support immediately.<br /><br />
