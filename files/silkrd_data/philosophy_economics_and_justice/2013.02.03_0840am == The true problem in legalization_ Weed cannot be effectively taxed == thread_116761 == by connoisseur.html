				It should be taxed at the point of sale only.&nbsp; I feel it&#039;s no different than people having any garden.&nbsp; You can grow all the tomatoes, cucumbers, etc&nbsp; you want and not pay any taxes on the crop unless you try to sell them.&nbsp; If your just consuming it there should be no taxes, government will get theirs on the stuff you may/maynot buy to assist you in growing ie tools, fertilizers, taxes on the land, etc <br /><br />&nbsp;But just like with people growing their own organic vegetables, just because they &quot;can&quot; in no way means they will.&nbsp; At least here in the states, I assume when finally legal you&#039;ll have people growing at home but that will in no way slow down massive tax revenues that will be generated by the multitudes who have no interest in growing their own but will love going to the store and buying it from McWeed&nbsp;

				The fact that this place exists, and continues to exist despite every government in the world seething in rage over it leads me to believe that taxation is difficult to enforce anyway.<br /><br />Have any of you voluntarily paid taxes to your country with your Bitcoin purchases? For the USA, IRS will happily take any voluntary tax reports you give them, after they tell you how it&#039;s your patriotic duty to pay them, that they are completely entitled to the money you give them, that the apparent voluntary nature of your donation is actually illusory, and that they will find out if you&#039;re holding anything back and shove you into prison if they do.<br /><br />It is hubris and folly that the governments of the world seriously think we&#039;re going to be afraid of them.

				You are right.<br /><br />We in the Netherlands can grow 5 plants freely for their own use. The judge will find you guilty of growing a illegal plant but will give no penalty, and starts to punish if you have 6 plants or more.<br />So everything the police does is wasted time, as long as you stay under your limit of 5 plants<br /><br />Indeed even while we in the Netherlands evrybody, can grow our own weed, we all do buy the weed at the coffeeshop.<br />It is 1&nbsp; maybe 2% of the weed users that grow their own weed, everybody else is simply buying at the cofeeshop. <br /><br />But tax has to be payed, weed is no more difficult to tax than alcohol or tobacco<br /><br />We have many different kind of taxes thst has to be paid over weed.<br /><br />Only The BTW (Belasting Toegevoegde Waarde) that means tax added value is not allowed.<br /><br />This has been decided by the European court of justice<br /><br />You do have to pay tax over your turn over (omzetbelasting) vennootschapsbelasting (like tax for a joint cooperation) , inkomsten belasting (income tax), loonbelasting ( tax over the salary of a emloyee) and so on, in case you have made yourself a employee of your own company. And you have to pay the OZB-belasting, tax for the apartment/store.<br /><br />So there will be a lot of tax left, and indeed they estimate your turn-over. <br />If you think you have to pay too much, it is up too you to proof otherwise.<br />&nbsp;A lot of power has the tax collector. <br /><br />In the days of Robin Hood , Al Capone and now these days.<br />Pecunia non olet.<br />Death and taxes, you can always count on them!

				Many people make their own alcohol, tax-free. But this pales in comparison to people who drink but do not make any alcohol. I think the reason so many people grow their bud is because reliable vendors are few and far between. I&#039;m willing to bet that if weed were legalized, less than 5% of people would grow their own, and perhaps less than 1%. I have no idea, but it wouldn&#039;t be many. Most people don&#039;t have the time, patience, and gardening skills to pull it off.

				Just because there are some people who will grow their own plants, there are lots of people who smoke weed who just don&#039;t have the time or desire to grow their own crop, even if it was legal to do so.&nbsp; Undoubtedly there will be plenty of shops selling all kinds of pot and it would be foolish to say they won&#039;t do a good business.<br /><br />Not to mention, these people who are going to be growing weed aren&#039;t necessarily going to want to just give it out for free and would probably want in on the legal weed industry.<br /><br />It would raise millions in the taxes of it and save hundreds of millions with all the money formerly being used to fight the war against it.

				As I see it, weed would be taxed up to the point where it would be more profitable for users to either grow it themselves or buy it on the blackmarket. Taxes on cigarettes in the UK are extortionate - resulting in many smokers buying counterfeit or imported cigarettes to avoid the tax. But I&#039;ve never heard of anyone growing a tobacco plant to avoid the tax. Is it actually any harder to grow than weed? Thinking about it, I&#039;m sure it is.<br />I honestly think there will be fewer personal growers following legalization, simply for convenience.

				Washington state will have a 25% tax on all legal marijuana sales, at every point of sale. For example a grower sells to a wholesaler $1000 of weed, plus $250 sales tax, a wholesaler then sells that same weed to a retailer for $2500 plus $625 to the tax man, then the retailer sells his weed for $50 an eigth plus 25% sales tax. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				I think the word legalization has two meanings.<br /><br />One is the meaning in which growing, selling and consumption of marijuana is socially accepted and agents of government don&#039;t bother you.<br /><br />Nobody here has a problem with that. That&#039;s kinda where we were going with this thing.<br /><br />However for some people, legalization means strict market regulation by the state, taxation. On that count you&#039;ll find DPR and the vendors and myself completely set against your ideals. I&#039;ve already made an entire thread on the subject in which I was repeatedly downvoted by forum posters who didn&#039;t like to hear that A: state regulations are fundamentally antithetical to free marketeers like ourselves and B: there are really good reasons you don&#039;t want a State to be involved in the production and distribution of narcotics, on both economic (inefficiency, monopolism, high prices) and social (use as a tool of suppression e.g. compulsory drug consumption) grounds. All of this has happened before in other countries. Legalization leading to the development of monopolies isn&#039;t legalization. It means it&#039;s legal to consume drugs, not for business people to manufacture and distribute them without being a government crony lobbying for such from the hugely corrupt and frankly inept pharma &quot;industry&quot; (a whole other rant I won&#039;t get into). Who sells you drugs, it really matters. Legalization without free market competition would be the worst of all worlds. <br /><br />Besides, there is another very strange idea that pervades the legalization camp. That is that democracy has something to do with this*. That is absolutely hilarious and I laughed for ten minutes until I realized the other people talking to me were serious. If you think voting for what you want will have any effect on national drug policy whatsoever I&#039;ve a bridge to sell you. Thinking this way is like thinking replacing the engine of a cruise ship has an impact on the arrangement of the deck chairs. In the short term you may have an impact, but in the long term these sorts of things are determined by self interest. The truth is that it is not in the interests of the government to legalize drugs because it&#039;s a multi-billion dollar racket. People&#039;s jobs, huge numbers of them, are predicated on drugs being illegal. Nor is it in the interests of cartels or mafias to legalize drugs, since the people manufacturing and distributing are going to be the pharmaceutical companies that bid the highest, and they won&#039;t bribe the right people with enough money unless they can ensure an absolute monopoly. We are selfish, self interested as well, the only difference is that we&#039;re willing to accept competition as a darknet market which will ultimately mean drugs will have higher quality, cheaper prices and more availability. Nothing else will work. <br /><br />In order to change a market system, you must first adapt the flows of capital within it into a structure that *actually accomplishes your goals*. Bitcoin is a great example of cryptoanarchists achieving their political goals via computer code creating a system of checks and balances that produces a financial system that suits their purpose. The way some pro-legalization people talk you&#039;d think talking about problems actually solved them. Nope. It&#039;s about the money. I don&#039;t mean that in a &quot;oh, money is so corrupting, what a world we live in&quot; sense, I mean it in the sense of forgetting to put in the foundation before you constructed the house sense.<br /><br />So you have two real options. You can persuade a bunch of people they&#039;ll make even more money than when they had a monopoly, or a different bunch of people that they can take over a monopoly (you can give different groups of people special names if you like, I don&#039;t give a fuck, it doesn&#039;t make a material difference). Then you can hope they are really &quot;Good Guys&quot; and these guys achieve what you want because it&#039;s the right thing to do.

That&#039;s kinda where we were going with this thing.<br /><br />However for some people, legalization means strict market regulation by the state, taxation. On that count you&#039;ll find DPR and the vendors and myself completely set against your ideals. I&#039;ve already made an entire thread on the subject in which I was repeatedly downvoted by forum posters who didn&#039;t like to hear that A: state regulations are fundamentally antithetical to free marketeers like ourselves and B: there are really good reasons you don&#039;t want a State to be involved in the production and distribution of narcotics, on both economic (inefficiency, monopolism, high prices) and social (use as a tool of suppression e.g. compulsory drug consumption) grounds. All of this has happened before in other countries. Legalization leading to the development of monopolies isn&#039;t legalization. It means it&#039;s legal to consume drugs, not for business people to manufacture and distribute them without being a government crony lobbying for such from the hugely corrupt and frankly inept pharma &quot;industry&quot; (a whole other rant I won&#039;t get into). Who sells you drugs, it really matters. Legalization without free market competition would be the worst of all worlds. <br /><br />Besides, there is another very strange idea that pervades the legalization camp. That is that democracy has something to do with this*. That is absolutely hilarious and I laughed for ten minutes until I realized the other people talking to me were serious. If you think voting for what you want will have any effect on national drug policy whatsoever I&#039;ve a bridge to sell you. Thinking this way is like thinking replacing the engine of a cruise ship has an impact on the arrangement of the deck chairs. In the short term you may have an impact, but in the long term these sorts of things are determined by self interest. The truth is that it is not in the interests of the government to legalize drugs because it&#039;s a multi-billion dollar racket. People&#039;s jobs, huge numbers of them, are predicated on drugs being illegal. Nor is it in the interests of cartels or mafias to legalize drugs, since the people manufacturing and distributing are going to be the pharmaceutical companies that bid the highest, and they won&#039;t bribe the right people with enough money unless they can ensure an absolute monopoly. We are selfish, self interested as well, the only difference is that we&#039;re willing to accept competition as a darknet market which will ultimately mean drugs will have higher quality, cheaper prices and more availability. Nothing else will work. <br /><br />In order to change a market system, you must first adapt the flows of capital within it into a structure that *actually accomplishes your goals*. Bitcoin is a great example of cryptoanarchists achieving their political goals via computer code creating a system of checks and balances that produces a financial system that suits their purpose. The way some pro-legalization people talk you&#039;d think talking about problems actually solved them. Nope. It&#039;s about the money. I don&#039;t mean that in a &quot;oh, money is so corrupting, what a world we live in&quot; sense, I mean it in the sense of forgetting to put in the foundation before you constructed the house sense.<br /><br />So you have two real options. You can persuade a bunch of people they&#039;ll make even more money than when they had a monopoly, or a different bunch of people that they can take over a monopoly (you can give different groups of people special names if you like, I don&#039;t give a fuck, it doesn&#039;t make a material difference). Then you can hope they are really &quot;Good Guys&quot; and these guys achieve what you want because it&#039;s the right thing to do. Or you can go the free market route and leave it open to everybody to participate. The lazare faire route will actually achieve what you want. Let the market decide. <br /><br />* Do you remember voting to criminalize drugs in the first place? In fact does anyone? No. In reality small lobby groups with outsize leverage have always decided it, since forever A.D, either religious fanatics and/or monopolists.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly true and perfect post. Might as well end the thread on&nbsp; that note. +1. You can only count on those in power to do one thing, and that&#039;s to be unethical and selfish. They want to keep they&#039;re perceived power by sucking up to the rich who are actually in power, but they don&#039;t actually have any say in anything.
