I just had a mini melt down on one of your other threads and as the thoughts came screaming in my head I realized that this was not the proper thread for this. Now, as my brain wears to near nothing I find the one that I was looking for from the beginning. I sure the reason is far beyond my comprehension, that is me finding this now rather than earlier.&nbsp; So I probably saved myself a great deal of shame, and personal info that would have caused me concern.<br /><br />Let me think about this for a few days and come back.&nbsp; But yea, truth is some powerful stuff.&nbsp; Hell all these threads are!&nbsp; Whatcha doin ST6?&nbsp; Introspection for the masses on The Road?&nbsp; Cool!&nbsp; ;)

For every person it&#039;s going to be different. Some want love, or money, or to enjoy themselves as much as possible. Which one&#039;s right and which one&#039;s the true reality and right one we should all strive for. I don&#039;t think there will ever be one answer for that.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Your mind makes it real</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>~Morpheus - The Matrix<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes. It&#039;s amazing how our minds work. I think to find out the truth you need to first conquer your mind and learn when it&#039;s trying to trick you cause it will if given the chance. On the other side your mind can be a powerful force that can be used to change the course of humanity or the current flow of history onto a different and more rewarding life for everyone.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you&#039;re inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>~Morpheus - The Matrix<br /><br />I especially like this quote because you can replace the word &#039;The Matrix&#039; and replace it with &#039;The Government&#039; and it still applies.<br /><br />And finally the most relevant quote regarding this topic:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>~Morpheus - The Matrix<br /><br />This quote is especially profound as it will have a different meaning for everyone but I think it infers that they&#039;re are some basic truths in this world. For example the US is not really a democracy but an secretly oppressive government. However that&#039;s still not a universal truth cause if you were to ask say John Mccain he&#039;s probably get his hunting rifle and shoot you.<br /><br />It astounds me when I watch movies from over 10 years ago how it can be applied to our current time in history. How it&#039;s still relevant and the writers and directors almost had a sixth sense on what path we were heading down. <br /><br />

				Miah <br /><br />We are like minds on the subject of the truth, I believe.&nbsp; I use the matrix myself when explaining life and the truth to people.&nbsp; It&#039;s uncanny how a supposed fictional movie can come so close to real life.&nbsp; Life indeed is a system, and the truth is lying there right in front of our eyes.&nbsp; Most don&#039;t see it, or care to see, they are not ready to be &quot;unplugged&quot;.&nbsp; The system continues to survive this way.&nbsp; <br /><br />Creators of stories like &quot;The Matix&quot; IMO are visionaries who see reality and the future for what it really is.&nbsp; I love old movies and when I watch them I see how brilliant the human creative mind is.&nbsp; The creativity of the human mind is like a time machine to me, hindsight is 2020 and looking back I see this &quot;truth&quot;.
