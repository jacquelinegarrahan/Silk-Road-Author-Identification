				So everyone in the states has heard about this horrific tragedy and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton Connecticut. It is reported that 27 people were killed, 20 being children. Now, many people are urging the government to change its gun laws. Personally, I think this is the stupidest idea. After the shooting in Aurora Colorado happened in the movie theater, many theaters had cops present (especially in NYC). After the Elementary school shooting, cops have been sent to stay in many schools. This boggles my mind. Who cares if it was a movie theater, grocery store, school, amusement park etc. The problem is that one of our fellow citizens went out in public and unloaded a weapon. The type of location is irrelevant. Its a tragedy, but the way to stop public shootings is not by having cops present at every coffee shop because there was a mass shooting at another coffee shop. What are the chances that type of public place is a target again. There is not much we cn do to stop these terrible incidents. Guess what America, lifes not perfect. We are a really fucked up nation who lives under a even more fucked up regime. And disarming citizens only gives us less protection. Criminals will have guns no matter what, so as a citizen we should have the right to own a gun to protect ourselves and our families from these psychopaths. And you wanna talk about mass murders, the gvernments of the world are kings at this. And it all starts with disarming its citizens. <br /><br />1911 – Turkey disarmed it’s citizens, and between 1915 – 1917 they murdered 1.5 million Armenians.<br />1929 – Russia disarmed it’s citizens, and between 1929 – 1953 they murdered 20 million Russians.<br />1935 – China disarmed it’s citizens, and between 1948 – 1952 they murdered 20 million Chinese.<br />1938 – Germany disarmed it’s citizens, and between 1939 – 1945 they murdered 16 million Jews.<br />1956 – Cambodia disarmed it’s citizens, and between 1975 – 1977 they murdered 1 million Educated people.<br />1964 – Guatamala disarmed it’s citizens, and between 1964 – 1981 they murdered 100,000 Mayan Indians.<br />1970 – Uganda disarmed it’s citizens, and between 1971 – 1979 they murdered 300,000 Christians.<br /><br />Just a few examples to open your eyes on how disarming a civilization is very risky. And the US&nbsp; government has purchased over 750 million hollow point rounds, which cannot be used overseas. Domestic use only, enough so theres atleast 2 bullets per civilian. <br /><br />Our right to bear arms is in the constitution and should not be taken away. More tragedies and shootings will happen, its part of life. its the world that we live in. We cannot take away violence, but we can protect ourselves and our loved ones.

				I agree.&nbsp; I saw a news report the other night and it stated &quot;Many Americans are alarmed as the number of applications for concealed carry permits is on the rise, especially in light of the shootings that took place last week&quot;.&nbsp; I was talking to my wife on the phone at the time and i started yelling at the TV.&nbsp; These two things are not the SAME they are OPPOSITES!&nbsp; The people that are taking classes, getting fingerprinted, and registering their guns are not the same people shooting massive amounts of people in public. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also saw a video clip a couple of weeks ago where a couple of thugs stormed into a coffee shop with guns out.&nbsp; An old man walked up from the side and started blasting at them.&nbsp; The two thugs ran like crazy.&nbsp; There is no telling how different the outcome would have been if there wouldn&#039;t have been an armed man already there.&nbsp; I&#039;m not a big gun toting guy, but it has been my right my whole life and i don&#039;t intend on giving it up.&nbsp; Crazy!

				I&#039;m not against guns but if someone wants to rob you i think it&#039;s not worth it to risk your life for money. You can always earn them back, but you can&#039;t get your life back or if bullet hits your spine and leaves you disabled you will regret for the rest of your life.

				Not a single moron has chirped up to talk about regulation, it makes me feel better about humanity.<br /><br />I cant believe how many people are for goverment regulation of guns, especially here on a site that has sprung up because goverment has chosen to waste time and money attempting to regulae drugs. Governments suck at enforcing prohibition, Do people not see the simalarites?<br /><br />The second amendment is not about target practice or hunting, its about having guns to protect yourself from your government.&nbsp; The feds can try and ban anything they want, i already have my guns and im not giving them up.

				Disarming the people doesn&#039;t seem to be the solution.<br /><br />I live in the netherlands, a country with strict gun control, where litterally only outlaws carry guns, apart for the odd legit hunter.<br /><br />Preventing civilians from having guns does not stop people from killing each-other - they just resort to different means. Having a much lower number of guns present in the population does reduce gun violence by a great deal. But you should also look at what replaces firearms. If you look at &#039;in the heat of the moment&#039; killings people result to different means, such as runnig eachother over with cars, clubbing heads in with pipes and what not.<br /><br />If it comes to premeditated murder,&nbsp; it only causes people to perform that by more insidious means. As a chemist i wouldn&#039;t even consider a gun as a mans to murder someone, having si many less detectable and more insidious options available.

				Interesting points made by everyone. As someone who does not like guns, I still respect the second amendment. However, I do believe we need stricter guidelines for owning something such as an assault rifle. I know the arguments of both sides but there is something terribly wrong with how accessible some of these guns are. I agree that disarming citizens all together can be dangerous and is a bad idea. The problem is I dont think we can exactly keep track of every single person who is mentally ill and willing to commit such crimes, so there has to be some sort of way to make them less accessible. <br />I agree with Chris Rock, start charging a million dollars for each bullet, then a person will think twice before taking another persons life. Ah, if only it were that easy. Nice to see a good discussion about it. <br />The one thing that I dont understand is why gun owners always act like any day now the government is going to break down their door and seize their guns. I just dont see that happening here in America. I know they do seize weapons from time, but not if you have a license and are dealing legally, if at all. <br />In hindsight, the proliferation of destructive weapons in general is a very profitable business no doubt. I cringe when I think of the money we spend each year, trillions, on creating the newest most high tech death machines. Is the end game here not our eventual self destruction? I personally believe it is only a matter of time. And when it happens, I just hope there is time to sit back and enjoy the disaster. We humans had a pretty good run.

				The Chris Rock joke is a bullet costing &quot;$5000&quot; dollars. I&#039;m glad to see so many of my fellow citizens starting to arm themselves and not buy into all the media hype. I&#039;m still waiting for them to explain how Adam Lanza shot all those kids with a Bushmaster AR-15 that was recovered from the trunk of the car, when his body was found inside the gym along with the two pistols. AR-15, M16, it doesn&#039;t matter which AR type you&#039;re more in favor of, unless that fucker has a grenade launcher on it or you have an RPG stashed somewhere it still won&#039;t be enough once Obama starts ramping up Drone strikes on the homefront the way he has overseas. If only all those &quot;occupy&quot; hipster morons had all been armed and outside the Whitehouse instead of clogging up NYC even more. I&#039;m not too worried yet though, if any president in our nation&#039;s history ever has the military turn on him, my money&#039;s on Barry.

				when they take all the guns and war materiel from the military and LE...then we can talk about a non violent gunless society.&nbsp; background checks? mental health checks? You sheeple that would trust that more govt oversight and that govt is at all capable of deciding who&#039;s dangerous and not (mental health &quot;experts&quot; are part of the system, part of the problem) are laughable. They would more likely keep guns from political enemies...and criminals? All us pot smokers for example...<br />

It&#039;s about as dumb as those who want to ban &quot;clips&quot; (called magazines) that are larger than x amount of &quot;bullets&quot; (called cartridges ding dongs).

If you really want to kill people grab a semi-auto shotgun folks..... there is no missing and damage is much more severe so you won&#039;t need 30 small caliber cartridges. Most all of the pistols are semi-automatic these days as well. I laugh at these &quot;leaders&quot; who can&#039;t even get briefed properly on the terminology and it worries me that they know fk all about the subject. It&#039;s one thing if crazy housewife doesn&#039;t understand and wants some knee jerk feel good law about &quot;Assault rifles&quot; passed but I think our representatives are shat when they are not informed properly. <br /><br />If you want to put energy into something worthwhile, help your state officials come up with ways to find the &quot;nuts&quot; with better mental health care ect ect ect. At least that may truly help lower the number of potentials unlike some silly feel good ban on X type of weapon while leaving the other types alone. The only way your solution works at all is a complete ban and then we know what your answer is the main question above. You have your right to your opinion but please make an informed decision.

				Title: <strong>Re: Disarming US Citizens</strong><br />

				I suppose civilian operated drones aren&#039;t out of the question either, its just an escalation of a situation.<br /><br />Living in gun controlled europe i admire the american citizens for defending their right to bear arms. <br /><br />I think a gun is something very proportional to own. Obviously there are situations where one individual takes a gun a kills of dozens, there is no denying that as it has happened several times before and will happen again. Of course these incidents are dramatic every time they happen. With guns available the casualties are sometimes in the dozens, which may seem like a large amount of when it hits the news.<br /><br />When no guns are available and some madman decides to kill a lot of people the outcome can be much worse. It could be a bombing, or even worse, a biological attack. <br /><br />Perhaps this seems far fetched, but in reality in western europe is is far easier to legally obtain the materials required for a serious bomb attack and even the development of a chemical or biological attack than it is to obtain a single handgun. Gun control will prevent a number of deaths - not the shootings in the news, but small personal drama&#039;s where someone shoots another in a lovers quarrel or deal gone bad. In countries without widely available guns such situations are resolved more often by stabbing or clubbing that have a better chance of survival compared to gunshot. <br /><br />People that intent on killing a large number of people on their way out will not be deterred by legislation in the first place, but may resort to much more destructive methods if guns are not available. <br /><br />With that i&#039;d say to american citizens: protect your right to bear arms. Europeans do not have this right any longer, yet outlaws do have plenty of guns. Obviously anyone owning a gun is an outlaw by definition here, but you know what i mean.
