				Hello Brothers and Sisters,<br />I got some shit to tell ya&#039;ll.<br />First off, I wish to be known now as Ve$c0r.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have had a much more prestigious nameS in the past, but that means nothing now other than to clarify I am not a newbie to the game both on the street and in the clouds(online), but I am new to tor; I haven&#039;t touched a computer for the last 5 years, just a lot of reading.<br />Now that i got a laptop I can experience TOR!<br />God bless this opportunity which allows all walks of life can talk freely across the globe with little expertise in networking, coding or ect.<br /><br />Just as a quick get to know me-<br />Getting a laptop might not sound like a big deal, but I&#039;m home free, or you might say homeless.&nbsp; So now its needless to say, I&#039;m broke, plus i fucked with tech most my life. I kinda wanted an escape.<br />I was a I.T. guy, mainly Data base admin, started selling drugs and made a ton of money.&nbsp; got cocky, got caught, did time, got out and only wanted to play my guitar and travel America.<br />So I live on the streets wrapped in a sleeping bag and tarp to disguise myself as a piece of garbage, lol-true!<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m a good looking guy, good hygiene, but I said fuck the world, and pursued travel, sex and all around anarchy.<br />I been all over the USA, prefer around Los Angeles.<br />I Seen everything out here, or so I thought.<br /><br />CRAZY SHIT IS HAPPENING AND NOW ITS THE LAST STRAW!<br /><br />Quick notes:<br />---They lock the doors at every park bathroom at night then the news films People pissing in the streets.&nbsp; --- This upsets the yuppies makes them hate us.<br />---They ticket us for sleeping---WTF<br />---Cops make the gangs clear out the youngsters.&nbsp; I know, because the gangs tip me off and ask me to try to clear them before they have to beat the sleeping kids up--This is politics, but we try to protect the streets from 5-0, all of us here.<br />---I seen cops rape a Chica right on the beach....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />---Every Thursday the 5-0 rounds up the streets to a large park.&nbsp; TODAY I was near a large SFV park and I was Horrified.<br />---THEY ARE MOVING US TO AN UNDISCLOSED AREA!!!!<br />Probably justified by saying they had warrants on the people, which is true they&#039;re warrants for unpaid sleeping fines, violations.<br />---but its a misdemeanor to sleep in a car, check the new laws.<br />---(to Americans) How many peps do you know in the law system?&nbsp; ---why do you think?<br /><br />And The list goes on.<br /><br /><br />I knew them, most are good people that fell onto the streets recently, they can&#039;t survive alone.&nbsp; I help all my fellow Americans, I share my last food with the hungry.&nbsp; I help elderly with bags and all sorts of love and street passion.&nbsp; - plus, they usually they tip well without asking, but hey! This is California KICKDOWNS. Code of the streets, we all know it here!<br />Then I smoke a blunt and hit on the wanna-be Stars, and a couple real ones.&nbsp; ;D<br />Fuck! its Hollywood! <br /><br />RECENTLY, old ladys have been the least of the street-veteran concerns including myself.<br />There&#039;s like ten times more fallen yuppies, young, old, guys, girls, sober, fucked, or what-eve.&nbsp; Some of them go insane instantly.&nbsp; Many us old schools Home-Frees chose this life, They didn&#039;t. And they say the economy is getting better...<br />&nbsp;<br />We try to look out for them, but we don&#039;t got much.&nbsp; least I can do is teach them the ropes because many go insane or get hurt.&nbsp; Especially the pretty chicas,&nbsp; They all been tricked and kicked.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pray for them.&nbsp; Could be or happen to someone you know. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I know everyone on these streets, I know when my street children, brothers and sisters disappear...&nbsp; I heard the rumors, and noticed people missing.<br />&nbsp;On 6-27-13 at 2:00 Cali time, I SEEN it.<br /><br />I seen a lot more in my travels,&nbsp; Too much to write.&nbsp; Lets just say I&#039;m convinced we have&nbsp; 5-10 years before martial law if we&#039;re lucky.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll post more if I get the same love here as on the street.<br /><br />But anyways, This reminds me of a&nbsp; story my grandma told me.<br />One day she looked out the window and seen people cuffed and taken by the Nazis, a few weeks later they KILLED my grandmas family as she stayed hidden in a closet.<br /><br />YOU ALWAYS START MARTIAL LAW WITH CONTROLLING THE LOWEST LIKED PEOPLE!<br />THE US GOV KNOWs A SHIT STORMs COMING AND THEY ARE PREPPING!<br /><br />------HELP US, WE HAVE A PLAN!-------<br /><br />We need to set up farm/bases to sustain food and rest for future people and patriotic soldiers of the struggle across the USA.<br /><br />ALL LANDOWNERS SHOULD TAKE THIS IN CONSIDERATION!<br />YOU CAN HELP FEED AN ARMY,OR A CITY, AND THAT&#039;S NOBLE AS FUCK!<br /><br />Food is highly underrated...<br />and there is a bubble, growing. No one knows when it will pop.<br />&nbsp;And if it pops and the dollar collapses the price of food hyper-inflates along everything else. Like WW2 Italy. <br />people get crazy without food, like so many past and current civilizations.<br />This type of panic is a great reason to declare full MARTIAL LAW.<br />The herd may even say &quot;Thank You&quot; like they did in Boston.<br />Perhaps a test?<br />---arrgggg don&#039;t matter that&#039;s just conspiracy, Not facts. <br />FACT&nbsp; --- several fed agencies did call MARTIAL LAW in the Boston streets<br />and people felt safe.<br /><br />We truly believe something horrible is coming.<br />Something that&nbsp; might even eclipse past horrors with a new found terrible <br />darkness. <br />&nbsp;We also believe the morning after will be some of the brightest in our history.<br />.<br />Yes I&#039;m saying &quot;we&quot;<br />I&#039;m Reppin a few Street-Veterans here.<br />We got plans<br />WE NEED CAPITAL,<br />are not asking -directly- for money, I&#039;m a bum, not a beggar and used to be a hell of a street dealer- there is a difference. <br /><br />BUT,<br />&nbsp;IF YOU WANT TO HELP, BLESS YOU!<br />We thank any kindness you bestow,&nbsp; <br />We plan to return that kindness to all in need.<br /><br />The first, easiest and also very helpful help is spreading the word.<br /><br />Any donations will go directly, and only into buying our first 50 gram MDMA purchase.<br /><br />IF YOU FRONT ME MDMA!&nbsp; I WILL PAY IT BACK!<br /><br />and I&#039;ll become a great return customer, because I&#039;m gonna sell the shit out of it!<br />I mean FUCKING KIs across California!<br />plus you&#039;ll be assured proceeds are going to the future prep.<br /><br />I Chose to say fuck money a while ago, but if I fight without it, It will just be me throwing a empty jack bottle at a cop.<br />Either way I&#039;ll fight to the death.<br /><br />These songs of freedom, are all I ever had....-Bob Marley<br />And that&#039;s all I have, except for this new 10 year old laptop!<br /><br />I understand if you don&#039;t trust me, but please at least research events like these across the country and spread the word.<br />&nbsp;<br />Once, I almost dehydrated to death screaming for water as yuppies laughed in the dessert. So Hot I even had 1st degree burns from the sun.<br />BUT... When I make it, I will let them drink from my wells, and break bread.<br />I&#039;m doing this for everyone, one way or another.<br /><br />Thank you for reading,<br /><br /><br />Ve$cor,<br /><br /><br />The mentally challenged bum on many California curbs playing a mean guitar.<br />&quot;maybe he&#039;s not slow, maybe that&#039;s all an act?&quot;<br />Maybe I was just watching.&nbsp; Front Seat, Watching It all.<br />Shows over, time to get up, stand up, stand up for our rights...<br /><br />update 6/29/13 sunset<br />Currently dancing across Venice beach boardwalk with some pretty chicas, come get me!<br />No worries, <br />In a metropolitan area of over 20 million and the streets still bleed together, but look different. With different lives and backrounds, but listening to many different languages, with many eyes hidden amongst the herd watching, and whispering in the alleys;<br />&nbsp;WE ARE THE STREETS OF LA, A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.<br />Especially If we can organize completely.<br />Every Angeleno, visitor and/or average person with an educated guess knows it.<br />As of now, I can only talk like this to a few good men, and my tor family.

				Update<br /><br />A semi-trustworthy street source who is an avid outdoorsman said there is a cleared valley with no road in the LA national forest surrounded by razor wire and in the middle what appears to be a concrete lot (heli pad?) and watch tower. <br />It would make sense, close to 15 million possible &quot;terrorists&quot; and no road out of <br />very rough mountain/desert terrain.<br /><br />I&#039;m gonna investigate and rest assured I&#039;ll bring back gps coordinates and pics if its there, or possibly put to rest an Angeleno &quot;fema camp&quot; scare!<br />It may take a while, that&#039;s a hard core journey being Home-free, Hahaha.

				You live in LA and that in itself is a great asset even though you are home free. LA is flooded with cheap cocaine from Mexico. Since you know the streets, you can get high quality cheap cocaine and resell it here on SR for over $100/gram. If you don&#039;t have money to get started, borrow it, or get a temporary job and save up. You don&#039;t need much, all you need is $500 to open a vendor account and $100-200 to buy your first grams and stamps. In a matter of days you&#039;ll go from sleeping on the street to sleeping in a nice house. You&#039;ll also raise the money for your farm house/community in a matter of weeks.

People are being murdered all the time. <br />its PROPAGANDA to eliminate any organization left on the streets when they haul street-vets out on bullshit warrants to make room on these streets for the next wave of fallen yuppies who lost their job, will,&nbsp; and/or minds, and have no use for the machine. <br /><br />I&#039;m also tapping every resource in the matrix to come up with $1000 for the mdma.<br />MDMA is not a &quot;Gang&quot; drug. I have street blessings and a high profit margin with MDMA.<br /><br />The cokes a good idea except,<br />Good Mexican cocaine involves Mexican mafia.<br />You will fucking die... some how, you will die if you fuck with these guys, maybe before I can throw a bottle of Jack at the cops. hahaha<br />I&#039;m just trying every avenue of raising the capital or getting the drugs I can and getting the ball rolling! lol<br /><br />Lastly,<br />&nbsp;I don&#039;t, we don&#039;t want a house or houses.&nbsp; You never know where we are! I give you a hint, probably in California. <br /><br />The &quot;farm&quot; Is strictly to help build a well organized &quot;peoples info-structure&quot; that can provide off the map cover and food for <br />resistance groupssss, or hopefully, resistance GROUP.<br /><br />another reason houses suck...<br />You know how many times pretty girls ask me if I live nearby?<br />Alot,<br />I smile and respond, <br />&quot;I just moved here from across town, I&#039;m staying right there&quot;. <br />I point to a beautiful 4 million dollar house on the beach where my gear is stashed .&nbsp; LOL

				Thank you all for the Karma and love. <br /><br />RESPECT is everything in the clouds and in the streets.<br /><br />I&#039;m hoping one day soon I may be able to earn the respect and of all your hearts.<br />Then we all can start REALLY working together.<br /><br />Wouldn&#039;t be something if a stranger&#039;s trust and act of kindness towards a complete stranger, was the start of a criminally-funded resistance!?!?!?<br />If I&#039;m correct this will make a big chapter in the history books, but at the very least it be documented here, now, and I promise later.<br /><br />And If I do earn your trust and betray you, then I&#039;m an asshole. <br />Yet, your a hero and great example in many ways. <br />But I promise I will never do that.<br />However promises don&#039;t mean much in the clouds. ---YET.<br /><br />Tor has a impressive background.<br />https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29#History<br /><br />This makes me think that we have powerful friends on the inside.<br />Why else would this amazing tool be leaked to the public at such a crucial time?<br /><br />To All People of the World,<br />California is very important, <br />LA alone has always been just that by itself.&nbsp; <br />That&#039;s why so many people form even YOUR OWN countries/states Come here or the Bos-wash region.<br />THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TARGETED FIRST BY THE GOV.<br />CONTROL SoCal &amp; Bos-wash, then you CONTROL THE USA.<br />&nbsp;IN RETURN, A MIGHTY ARMY....<br /><br />And they already started.<br /><br />On a different note, one about miracles.<br /><br />I woke up today In an Ally of Venice beach.&nbsp; I love the culture here.<br /><br />For me to go on, first you have the know Venice.<br /><br />Venice is a beach city of LA where the rich pay to live, and the homeless just live.<br />A boardwalk lined with pot shops, professional bums, liqueur, clothing, art, music, more bums, police, Shoreline Crips, and a few thousand Yuppie tourists with the look<br />of diss-belief at the seemingly utter chaos.<br /><br />On the street level, If you really know Venice, you see we the people truly govern ourselves.<br />The Crips keep it clean to make money off the yuppies, because they own everything.<br />The professional bums/home-frees add music and culture. This is LA, we all got mad talent here.<br />And we ALL keep eyes on the streets for the streets.<br /><br />If you take your girl down to the beach after darkness falls, we know your there.<br />All the bums, junkies, convicts, on the run criminals, and Gang members.<br />There&#039;s a good chance most of us know your names. <br /><br />You would of never known unless I said it, <br />With this knowledge you&#039;ll now see it clearly!<br />Relax, nothing bad will happen here, your completely safe, we gotcha back!<br />unless you break our laws.<br /><br />If you walk on the beach during daylight and start partying with people there is a 50/50<br />chance they are home-frees, lone wolfs or gang members and they are hustling the Venice way. <br /><br />WE ALL HATE THE POLICE who have a grossly large station right on the beach in the middle of it all.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br />First we awoke to a beautiful Rastafarian couple blessing the streets.<br />These 2 are some of the most sexually attractive people I seen and I&#039;m not so much attracted to African heritage people. <br /><br />They we&#039;re both dressed completely in the purest white fine linen. The male had the cleanest dreads, teeth and the most prefect build. <br />The female had what appeared to be the softest skin, high African cheek-bones like depicted on African statues staging gorgeous large brown eyes and a most welcoming smile I had ever seen.<br /><br />They we&#039;re&nbsp; Fuckin&#039; RASTA ANGELS!<br />Carrying two large bags filled with water bottles of wine, bread, jelly packets, and joints. They blessed 100s of us home-frees with many hugs (I was first in line to hug her!) and much love.<br /><br />Were they Crip&#039;s saying thank you?<br />were they from a church?<br />or Truly Rasta Angels.<br /><br />They never bothered to say.<br />We never bothered to ask.<br />Just a bunch of respect, blessings, and thank yous.<br /><br />That&#039;s Venice though.<br /><br /><br />Just recently, a friend I&#039;ll call Beeman did something awesome.<br /><br />This next scene is almost akin to as if&nbsp; family members are reuniting.<br />With much love, a big hug, and smiles, we embrace no matter if we haven&#039;t seen each other in a year, or a couple hours. <br />Even though I barley know the guy. <br />I don&#039;t know his real name, back round, or anything really.<br /><br />&quot;Jeez man What up Beeman&quot; <br />&quot;Lotta Brotha, I awoke this morning to another beautiful motha that would love to fix me up!<br />&quot;yo, bro, fo sho, That&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to do, I love you, and you know! <br />“I love me too, and you brother.&nbsp; got smoke?&quot;<br />and then we smoke.<br /><br />&quot;FIX UP&quot; is a joke many vets say.&nbsp; &quot;Fix&quot; as in bring us back into the machine, the one WE ALL recognize as flawed and dangerous. <br /><br />The rhyming is just they way some of us talk.&nbsp; We&#039;re ALL very animated to one another out here on the streets of Venice,&nbsp; It helps lure curious yuppies looking for something they can&#039;t get in a tour book for $1000.<br /><br />Yuppies usually bring a positive attitude, smiles, love, a case of beer, some food, drugs, a vagina SOMETHING FUCK!<br />That&#039;s Venice culture!<br /><br />With beeman I couldn&#039;t tell if he was crazy, always high, or just really good at his character.<br />Either way, he MAKES it work. Even now, he&#039;s probably less than 200 yards away from me hitting on girls so beautiful most guys would choke up.<br /><br />This guy looks like a blond Jack Sparrow from Pirates, elaborately dressed up in what he made from litter in the streets, and talks like Jack sparrow crossed with a surfer.<br /><br />He&#039;s a good looking guy, with a bad ass style.&nbsp; He makes the home-free thing work for him.He is also a master at getting picked up by a lot of Yuppie girls.<br /><br />Other then a deep and stimulating mental and hopefully PHYSICAL short term relationship; Yuppie girls, since they usually tend to stay in a&nbsp; hotel, and could bless you a warm shower, bed to sleep in, hot food, cold drinks, A.C. and a night sheltered from the police.<br /><br />We feel It&#039;s an even exchange, we tell them exactly what they need to hear,<br />“Thank you, your a great person inside and out sweet-heart”<br />That&#039;s all it takes. many people don&#039;t hear that.<br />And, We don&#039;t break their hearts because we don&#039;t fall in their “relationship type” EVER!<br />Hell that&#039;s cheaper and more therapeutic than any shrink, plus we&#039;re a exxxperence!<br />True California culture.<br /><br />Anyways, <br />In the middle of the sand on the beach there was a old beat up cloth office chair that some how appeared right in the middle of the beach among the daily masses of yuppies and chaos.&nbsp; <br /><br />This chair had a swarm of bees flying around it that would make Winnie the Pooh shit himself. Scared Masses of Yuppies we&#039;re fleeing to safety then peering back wondering what the fuck<br /><br />Beeman, with a twinkle in his eyes walked up to the chair, and very softly sings and picks it up.Lost in a haze of bees he starts to walk to a parking lot in the ally to remove the bees from the crowd.<br /><br />Now making A scene, A sexy young voice called out, <br />“Aren&#039;t the stinging you? “<br /><br />Amongst camera flashes, BeeMan gently dropped the chair in the middle of a open circle which everyone made for him. He walked up to her smiled and said <br />“Not at all baby girl”<br /><br />Then after some close whispering in front everyone, BeeMan continued to remove the chair off with a even bigger twinkle in his eyes.<br /><br />Only a pure faithful heart can pull that shit off.<br /><br />Much Love to your families, friends and selves.<br /><br />United we Stand, divided we fall.

				What up Playa<br /><br />Your right, although mainly in the Orange County. <br />That&#039;s still close enough to worry me.<br />I need gang blessing and respect for another chapter of this story hopefully far off if ever to come.&nbsp; <br />I must keep them on good terms and only risk my life against the government. It is my only real enemy.<br />Still, that being said, MDMA is not as dangerous territory compared to Heroin, Coke or Meth.&nbsp; <br />For example: Most heroin out here seems to come from mainly Asian or Russian/Armenian sources and then Mexican higher sources.<br /><br />Mexicans don&#039;t really mess with MDMA<br />Mexicans scare me most.<br />&nbsp;They&#039;re also the largest.<br /><br />Not to mention it seems like an awful lot of fucking heads are being cut off&nbsp; south of border over a big joke known as the &quot;American War On Drugs&quot;<br />&nbsp; <br />The heroin distribution I see makes sense though since Afghanistan is BOOMING &amp; BLOOMING since we started fighting there.<br />Can you guess what other countries are in the general vicinity?<br /><br />Mean while, America&#039;s &quot;heroin addicted teen epidemic&quot; has actually turned into an epidemic, lol.<br /><br />I Just find drugs like Heroin, Coke, Meth, and Alcohol seems more likely you get shot or your head chopped the fuck off. <br /><br />Even cops and most people know that. <br /><br />I think MDMA&#039;s growing approval is why In California Ecstasy isn&#039;t really legal or Illegal.&nbsp; Laws on MDMA are all fucked up.<br /><br />here&#039;s a link,<br />http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/dll/cal_ecstasy_law.htm<br /><br />Another reason I pick MDMA....<br />I&#039;m trying to build info-structure to fight I war MANY believe will come.<br />Selling drugs is the mean&#039;s to build, but not the goal.<br />I want to keep my risks minimal until hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong.&nbsp; It oddly soothes me to break laws I don&#039;t agree with.&nbsp; I work hard and sometimes suffer to make My very existence an act of rebellion.<br /><br />When you live like I, trying to sleep is rebellious - thus illegal. <br />Selling drugs is illegal - thus rebellious. <br />See a circle?<br /><br />That&#039;s one reason I&#039;m here writing, to try and get help any way possible.<br />The main reason is to document all this... <br /><br />Either way none of US here thought about Asian gang MDMA rights, and WE been brainstorming planning and debating strategies for the past 6 months.&nbsp; But I now know to stay out of the O.C.<br />Good looks.<br /><br />CURRENT UPDATE!<br />Bum news shopping-carted(joking/sorta) its way to the bottom of the LA national forest foothills.<br />Gonna bum it out until my government sponsorship (welfare) arrives, then I&#039;m gearing up to see if these camps exist!<br /><br />Peace Out.<br />.

That kinda mind fucked me for some reason.<br /><br />I have a hypothesis on silkroad.<br />I believe people with education and knowledge or openness and awareness, or at the very least have a sense of true FREEDOM tend to be just all that much more CIVILIZED! <br />Now take into account your local DMV...<br /><br />By the way. <br />The hood most deff sells tons of drugs.<br />However those drugs are typically dangerous and very addictive (crack, meth, opioids).&nbsp; <br />Even though I believe in total free will, I also believe drug topics need taught correctly to kids and shown respect by all.<br />I believe MDMA can ween off meth addiction(they are very much alike chemically), and has much less destructive properties.&nbsp; <br /><br />A big reason I would even CONSIDER selling it to MY PEOPLE.<br /><br />Meth=violent chaos &amp; addiction<br />MDMA=hugs and kisses.<br /><br />AND THE STREETS OF LA DON&#039;T HAVE MUCH MDMA!<br /><br />Its in the club/concert scene like a mother fucker though. lol
