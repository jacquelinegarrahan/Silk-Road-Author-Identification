				The illusion of democracy is prominent.<br /><br />I don&#039;t believe anybody should have to obey by laws and regulations set by total strangers. If there is anyone in your life that is to tell you what to do, it is only your parents as a child. Look up to your elders for you will find wisdom in them.<br /><br />The world government is not a democracy, why would I want somebody who hasn&#039;t even met me or hasn&#039;t lived alongside me on the same lands to tell me how to live??<br /><br />The illusion is so clear (paradox) in Australia where the Prime Minister has not been elected by the population for at least three years; even after elections. The problem is completely indirect democracy that gives a false sense of democracy. Even counting elections, it still isn&#039;t the population that chooses the prime minister!<br /><br />The Swiss have it better. At least they have the illusion of a direct democracy!<br /><br />We need a pure freedom revolution.<br /><br />I do not believe in socialism as a whole. Capitalism is not for everyone. Ideologies are theory / an idea. Practical societies are what the individuals make it.<br /><br />As always, each to their own! What are your thoughts?

				I somewhat agree. I think the democracy that we have now is very much an illusion. Just as Communism is the illusion of Marxism. <br /><br />In theory, such things are great, but in reality, ideals are compromised to work and most of the time the the illusion is held so the world can keep turning. <br /><br />I don&#039;t quite have any answers but I basically disagree with the current democratic political systems. The whole propaganda of your vote counts is complete bullshit. Your vote does nothing. Anarchy makes more sense than voting. Not only that, but what do you vote for now? Is it political ideals? Is it for a change in government? I perceive, in Australia anyway, that the whole voting process is now a popularity contest and nothing more. The prime minister is is becoming a celebrity. <br /><br />But I also perceive that people like this false sense of security. For most people, it is enough to live everyday. That&#039;s probably what shits me the most. That people believe they have freedom in a society that is so regulated and constricting. They are made comfortable in their lives by the governing power, and that keeps them quiet. <br /><br />I don&#039;t know. <br /><br />I wish I was more articulate about these thoughts. <br /><br />I might try and rephrase and structure it better another time.&nbsp;

				Its completely an Illusion like all of mainstream society is. Tricked into believing we are free. Given choices to do certain things and work for our masters and buy certain things. Its slavery under a different name and has been since the beginning. It shocks me how much Americans go on about being a democratic country that is trying to free the oppressed world when it is a TWO party system with no option of anything different and heavily controlled by the industries. The UK is the same as so is the rest of the world, at least in some others people can chose out of a few more dickheads to fuck up their country more.

				You know it&#039;s freaking weird hey. How people can live their life &#039;normally&#039; with the total belief in &#039;the system&#039;. I mean everyone has their complaints about different aspects but they can still be happy in general but at the same time pissed off at something they can&#039;t quite put the finger on.<br /><br />It&#039;s the illusion of any true freedom at all. It is denied by OTHERS. Have you ever thought... &quot;i&#039;d really like to... BUT.... &quot;<br /><br />You know what it&#039;s totally fucked because it&#039;s really a case of you&#039;re damned if you do, you&#039;re damned if you don&#039;t. Imagine you created your own country. At first the population might consist of you and a couple of friends. But then some more people come along. Eventually you have to make some rules right? Like you might base it on some morals. Murder isn&#039;t right, other basic safety stuff like building homes the right way so they don&#039;t collapse and kill people. <br /><br />BOOM there you go, society is born. Unfortunately, as much as I&#039;d like the ideal freedom revolution to occur; modern society has evolved to what it is today. I don&#039;t see that changing significantly anytime soon. Self-responsibility is a great thing. However, it relies on TRUST. Do you really trust every other person in the world?<br /><br />I DON&#039;T think so. That&#039;s why there are rules, laws. It&#039;s just fucked up that those same people that you don&#039;t trust also make and enforce those rules!!!!!!!

				Alas I agree with SuckDick4Weed (Dude...that name is just too damn funny BTW).&nbsp; <br /><br />Rules are a necessary evil.&nbsp; And rule of law is basically an embodiment of that evil.&nbsp; At least with a reasonably decent form of government you may have a chance to get your day in court, and convince some of your fellow humans that you don&#039;t deserve to be put in a box like an animal.<br /><br />Without the rule of law, it&#039;d be mob rule....and most mobs aren&#039;t into hearing your testimony.<br /><br />Besides...if there were no laws or governments...we&#039;d miss out on all the fun of finding ways to get around them!&nbsp; <br /><br />R.

				And you think it isnt mob rule now?! People who are not democratically elected to power tell you what to do, they kidnap you and hold you against your will. They inflict pain on you and demand money from you. They claim they protect you. They claim they are fair. They control what is allowed and they supply you with drugs but only on their terms. These people tell you that you cant own guns and knives because other bad people will hurt you and tell you what to do if they got hold of them, yet the same people who tell you this have guns and they use them for the same thing.<br /><br />Surely they arent that different from gangsters/mob rule.

				I&#039;ve always said that a two party race is the illusion of democracy. Referring to the United States Presidential race. The way to start cleaning up politics is to take the money out of it.. but that&#039;s never going to happen :(

				our buddy Karl Marx figured whoever controls the economic structure of the society controls everything else - politics, culture etc.<br /><br />even if the democracy is not always very good or a moral thing, you wouldn&#039;t want some comrade Stalin taking over either.<br /><br />compared to other systems, current democracy is a lesser evil.<br /><br />

They are the same animal. You can tell if you live in a democratic society simply by looking at the amount of input you have into making the rules (laws) of said society. If you think you have no input whatsoever then you dont live in a democracy.<br /><br />Here in the uk laws are made by a vanishingly small number of people and while some law we can allagree is good (murdering people is wrong for instance) even when we all might agree noone asked us anyway and they are not about to any time soon. Much of our law here in the uk stems from feudal times when a few people owned everything and the populace were serfs. People had to ask permission to travel for instance. Oh wait a minute they still do have to ask permission to travel. Passports anyone? Cynics may even claim nothing much has changed; a small nexus of power and wealth still calls the shots; and surprise surprise they pass laws to protect and perpetuate their control of our society. Plus ca change. Shantih.

				Yep, it&#039;s all just an Illusion with some postive reinforement to keep people believing they are free.<br /><br />We really need a decentralized internet government structure created by the people involving new implementations of cryptograhy and a free market. I&#039;m not sure how we would go about it lol but I think Silk Road&#039;s ideals are headed in the right direction.<br /><br />go to work, come home smoke some cigs, sip some alcohol, drowm out the reality, go to work that&#039;s the life right?
