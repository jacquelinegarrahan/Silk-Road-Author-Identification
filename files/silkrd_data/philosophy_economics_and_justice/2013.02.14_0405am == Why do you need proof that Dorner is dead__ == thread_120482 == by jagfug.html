				they would be parading Osama around like a damn show dog if they actually killed him,<br /><br />naa hes sat up in some plush hide away, US can be seen to be killing their friends to maintain the charade of terrorism, but they couldn&#039;t really follow through on someone whom they&#039;ve shared such a prosperous relationship with, they have slightly more sense than that!

				I heard from a little birdy in DC that Osama was killed years before the actual story broke. I believe it 100% Makes sense. Kill the man, make everyone believe he is still alive so we can dump more money into the war...<br /><br />Also call me crazy but I would go as far to say that was not Dorner. He seemed to clever to entrap himself like so. Who knows. Maybe he had dug an underground tunnel in that cabin in the 7 days prior while the manhunt was going on. Maybe the scuba gear he bought was for having oxygen underground. Not underwater. Maybe he lured them there purposefully, hopped in his tunnel, left a body and waited 24hr for it to cool down (no pun intended) then hopped out and went to Mexico while they are waiting for the results? Who would go as far to look for an underground tunnel under a burned down house.<br /><br />This is all just speculation but VERY possible.

				Some people speculate that they dumped Osama as he might have revealed unsettling information about 9/11. I mean he didn&#039;t take responsibility for it for over 2 years. It seems like al-qaeda would like that sort of attention if they did it.

				The problem I have with most conspiracy theorists is that they seem to always neglect applying the same level of scrutiny to their own hypotheticals as they do to the official narrative.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=120482.msg826566#msg826566">Quote from: dex on February 15, 2013, 02:48 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Better question is why do we not need more proof that Osama Bin Laden is dead?

Seems suspicious to me...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Select Intel committee members in the Senate and House expressed the same skepticisms until they were shown the pictures. I think it&#039;s a legitimate concern that worldwide circulation of a photo of a Muslim leader, even a hero for some, with his brains splattered all over the place would inflame radical violence and retribution.<br /><br />But the alternative theories that the death was faked after he died years ago make even less sense. If he died years ago, then the stage production should have been managed and capitalized upon politically by the last president. If it happened during this president&#039;s term then there were far better times for it to happen where it could have been better maximized for political gain.<br /><br />Furthermore, the level of not just complicity but proactive participation that would be required of Pakistan to stage manage the whole affair before the world makes the whole proposition a joke.&nbsp;
