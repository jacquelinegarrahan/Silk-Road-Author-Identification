				a little birdie told me.....<br /><br />the following drugs will be emergency scheduled (schedule I, FS893) on December 11, 2012 by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.&nbsp; they will be illegal for 6 months, but there is already pending legislation to outlaw these permanently.&nbsp; <br /><br />Pentedrone<br />Fluoroamphetamine<br />Fluoromethamphetamine<br />Methoxetamine<br />Methiopropamine<br />UR-144<br />XLR-11 (5-Fluoropentyl-UR-144)<br />AKB-48<br />5-Chloropentyl-UR-144<br />STS-135<br />URB-597<br />URB-602<br />URB-754<br />2C-D<br />2C-H<br />2C-N<br />2C-P<br />25I-NBOMe<br /><br />5-Fluoro-AKB-48 is not on the list, nor is the other NBOMe compounds so those are safe.&nbsp; As is Kratom (which was considered but ultimately left off the list).&nbsp; and 5 and 6 APDB and 5 and 6 APB are safe.<br /><br />

				MXE - methoxetamine, so yes that one will be controlled in just a few days.<br /><br />2C-N and 2C-H, as far as i know, are physiologically active.&nbsp; they are controlled federally, and the DEA generally does quite a bit of research before controlling drugs.<br /><br />MMA is still legal in FL<br /><br />drugs that are still legal in FL starting Tuesday:<br /><br />APB<br />APDB<br />25C-NBOMe among other NBOMe compounds<br />5-Fluoro AKB48<br />Mitragynine (Kratom)<br />Bromoamphetamine is an interesting drug.&nbsp; it will be legal.
