				From the beginning of the road there has been product requests for scopolamine. And every time it was requested there would be a moral debate. Well now that it is, what do we think. I am posting it in this section because this is a question of the roads morality. Do we stand against this or are we ok with it. Any thoughts?

				Scopolamine has always been legally available either by purchase from overseas pharm companies or by simple extraction from one of many very common plants. I don&#039;t see the moral conundrum with its being sold, and I&#039;m pretty sure most of the hype you hear about it IS hype. If you&#039;ve ever taken jimsonweed you&#039;d realize that the chances of someone coercing you into emptying your bank account are pretty slim, mostly because you&#039;d be unable to coordinate anything that complex. WALKING is difficult.

				It&#039;s been here for a while actually. I have not tried, or witnessed the effects of scopolamine or any other deliriant myself, but I know the &#039;myth&#039; of scopolamine. To those who don&#039;t, it is supposed to scramble short-term memory, giving the user the experience as if they are waking up from a dream, over and over, constantly forgetting where they are or what they are doing. In this very confused state, victims are supposed to become extremely naive.&nbsp; The trip should be pretty uncomfortable, so it has very little recreational value. My guess is that the effects of this drug are too unpredictable for it to be useful as a weapon.

And I&#039;m glad you mentioned GHB too. If I give a girl a little too much alcohol, I can easily bring her back to&nbsp; my place and do whatever I want. But if I slip a little too much GHB in her drink, she&#039;s going to pass out and you&#039;ve got a weekend at bernie&#039;s situation. Hell, lots of people just think that GHB is roofies. There&#039;s just so much myth and hype on the streets.

				The idea of comparing scopalamine with GHB wasn&#039;t necessarily the identity of their supposed uses so much as the power of their myths. GHB has a lot of &quot;documented&quot; use as a date rape drug, and it is &quot;well established&quot; as being primarily&nbsp; used for date rape, when anyone who has used GHB knows that, first of all, the taste is difficult to disguise, secondly it just isn&#039;t very commonly used for that purpose. If you want to rob/rape/kill someone, why not buy alprazolam powder and dust someones cigs?

				While I agree with TwoneNathandjoe that there is a lot of hype around scopalamine, and that if it were that powerful and did what its suppose to do it would probably be more widely used at this point wouldnt it? My gut reaction is to say hell no this doesnt need to be on the road because of that vice article but what is the truth here? Can anyone verify that it does indeed do what the vice article said it does?

				Clearnet warning:<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmNnhvnUI3Q<br /><br />That&#039;s a video with a girl speaking about tripping on scopolamine. Apparently people really do use it recreationally. <br />The dosage would be up to about 5mg if recreational, you just hallucinate and become a paranoid schizophrenic for the trip. After the 5 mg upwards depending on the person zombifying type effects happen. There has been reported deaths from children taking it at around 6mg, but there are reports of adults taking around 50mg with no damage.&nbsp; I plan on getting a few friends together and having them test it on me. They will make sure I don&#039;t do anything that can hurt myself. I guess that is the best way to see if it really zombifies.

				Still if you know anything about drugs similar to this then you know scopolamine isn&#039;t perfect for zombifying. If you watch all of the documentaries on Mk-ultra, the CIA mind control project, the closest they got was with extreme lsd dosage.<br /><br />What about some mixture of ghb, scopolamine, Flunitrazepam(roofies), and lsd. I feel like you could make a drug to cater to all of your dirty deeds and they would indeed be done dirt cheap seeing the low prices of those drugs.<br /><br />If your into the raping then a mix containing mainly ghb would help. If your into the robbing people aspect then a mixture containing mainly scopolamine and lsd would work. If your into revenge then scopolamine and lsd to start, then a knock out with ghb and Flunitrazepam which will allow you to beat the person as much as you want with no resistance. And if your into the whole murdering thing, but need the body this is the way to go.

				Just like a gun its something harmless imho. It just depends what you do with it. If you use a gun to kill a few kittens (no matter how bad the kittens are) then you are a bad person, the gun is just a gun. Same goes for scopolamine (if it even does what the documentaries say it does) if the person uses it to rob you its bad karma for him, not for the scopolamine :P

				It should be noted also that scopalamine has many great uses. It is a strong antichlorigenic and may be used similarly to other antichlorigenics, such as for motion sickness and general nausea, or for excessive salivation. It has been used successfully to treat addictions when administered in delerium-inducing doses for several consecutive days, under medical care of course.

				Be careful with it! I&#039;ve had scopalamine via Jimsonweed and it IS NOT fun. It feels like your body is completely dry, but at the same time your bladder feels full and you can&#039;t piss. Your skin will probably dry up a couple days after you use it, it&#039;ll look like you have eczema for a few days. The trip itself is very weird, but it won&#039;t blow your mind because you&#039;ll not give a fuck about anything. I didn&#039;t experience any extensive memory loss, but during the experience I did tend to forget snippets as time went on, similar to my earliest marijuana experiences.

If someone is selling &quot;robbery powder&quot; or &quot;rape powder&quot; or some other hypothetical shit, who gives a fuck whether it actually works or not? It&#039;s &quot;purpose&quot; is still to &quot;harm or defraud&quot;, and therefore should be banned according to SR guidelines, no?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The substance should not be banned!! the problem is the amount. it should be sold per mg or less maybe as patches(commercial) or on blotter paper. <br />1 gram is just insane amount.&nbsp; only patches dosed with microgram amounts can be used for medical reasons and for recreational use doses are under 5 mg.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />They&#039;re also selling 5g.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure if the amount thing is *so* important re: SR guidelines though, even if quite irresponsible on the part of the vendor. If the product is legit and should not be banned, then buying bulk quantities of said product should be fine also.<br /><br />If people are really using this recreationally (beyond &#039;seeing if the myth is true&#039;), then fair enough. A quick look at the feedback leads me to question this though. People ordering when drunk, people not knowing what the hell to do with it when it turns up, people saying that the myth isn&#039;t a myth, or that &quot;it could come in handy&quot; etc.<br /><br />I could be way off here. Maybe 2mg is fun as shit or something. I&#039;m just saying just because the myth is bullshit does not automatically mean it is not &quot;intended to harm and defraud&quot; people, intended being the key word.

				I seen a really good movie about the jimson weed :) it was a horror movie.<br /><br />I really want to try this, but you go first lol.&nbsp; When we find the right dosage, it&#039;s likely going to be a really good, -interesting high.&nbsp; If it&#039;s safe with the correct dosage, of course this should be sold on the road. Just don&#039;t go doing unknown lines of this drug..&nbsp; in my experience alprozolam CAN be very dangerous, and that is sold in mass.&nbsp;

				In my opinion scopolamine is a bad thing that could be used in a good way. A good comparison is a gun. No matter how you look at it a gun is made to shoot people which is bad. On the same side, I had a girlfriend that used to get aroused by guns. She would actually masturbate with the barrel of a gun. Now this is good, but lets be honest the intent of the gun isn&#039;t for masturbation, just like the intent for scopolamine isn&#039;t for fun.

				In my opinion, there isn&#039;t much of a moral debate. I mean, if someone wants to do harm to someone else they they will, whether scopolamine is available over SR or not. Plus, scopolamine can be used as a hallucinogen, albeit only by the very brave, and it&#039;s not like it&#039;s produced with rape / robbery in mind. There are already innumerable substances on SR that could be used for malicious purposes if someone wished; fentanyl, GHB, fuck we even have potassium cyanide for god&#039;s sake! I say it should be allowed, and that it&#039;s down to the end user to decide what they do with it.<br />Just my humble liberal opinion though ;)<br />- JH

				The best date rape drug is alcohol. Always will be. At least in my country. It&#039;s legal, if the girl drinks too much and you get to fuck her, she will never go to the police because she&#039;d just blame herself for being dumb and drinking too much. I don&#039;t see much value in date-rape drugs, if you are not retarded it should be farely easy to get a girl in bed. If you are, however, there will always be prostitutes and escorts for every pocket and taste. <br />That being said, I think it would be wrong to use drugs on anyone without their consent. Rather than empty someone&#039;s bank account and ruin his/her life why not just sell drugs and make a great profit. The risk of drugging someone without their consent is much higher than just selling the shit.

				Oh and if your talking about the scopolamine from the vendor p3nd8s, I bought a gram from him. Seemed like its so rare and you never know when it might come in usefull..<br />One thing I&#039;ll tell you for sure, the scopolamine i got is EXTREMELY potent!! I must have gotten a grain or two on my finger when I was opening the foil because I touched my left eye and my left eye swelled up big. I got pretty bad dry mouth and i was tired. Later, my sister saw my eyes and thought i was having a stroke because my pupils were so uneven. Wish i had a picture of my pupils lol <br />Pupil stayed huge for about 3 to 4 days, luckilly the dizziness and dry mouth only lasted the first 6 hours
