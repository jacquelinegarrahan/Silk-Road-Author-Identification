				Part 1 was interesting so I will definitely be watching part 2. Not as good as the book of course, but still fun to watch.

				I&#039;m not excited. I was completely disappointed by the first movie. I&#039;ll still watch Part II, but they&#039;d better have done a ton of work on improving the script, pacing, and general presentation. Part I was like a marginally better than average made for TV movie.

				Hmm, haven&#039;t seen either yet, though I&#039;ve been planning to. I&#039;m...curious, at the least. <br />Basically waiting until I&#039;m in a romantic enough mood to tolerate a few good speeches in a movie from a book 60% populated by Mary Sues&nbsp; ::).

				I saw Part II tonight. WAY better than Part I (though that&#039;s really not saying much), and much more watchable than the book is readable.

				It was an amazing book and movie, was really pissed about it being a two part movie but I am excited for part 2. Hopefully, it is as good as part 1. I think everybody should read that book, really helps you understand the corruption that takes place between business/governemt.

				It&#039;s actually a trilogy, and now I cannot wait for part 3!!!<br /><br />I saw part 2 last night and I must say it was so much better than part 1. Way more intense and entertaining. Not sure how I feel about the cast being completely different, but when your one of the few libertarian themed filmed to ever come to theaters, you kind of expect the budget to be small.&nbsp; :-\<br /><br />Either way, I highly recommend you all go see it ASAP! You&#039;ll be really glad you did!

				Good to hear! It&#039;s sad the Hollywood movie industry is so neo-liberal, so interesting movies like these are rarely successful and released in theaters :(. I was also upset the cast had changed but I guess it doesn&#039;t matter!

				The second part is in theaters now, so probably any digital release will be a crappy someone-filmed-the-screen-with-a-digital-camera thing. The first&nbsp; part my mom said she watched on Netflix last night.

				Politically funded films are usually shit. this 1 is funded by the koch brothers and is venerated by the tea partiers. Personally i think fuck the plutocracy, and this film champions the idea that without the bourgeoisie the masses would descend into anarchy.
