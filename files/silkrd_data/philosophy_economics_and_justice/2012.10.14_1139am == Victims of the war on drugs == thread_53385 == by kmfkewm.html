				In poohbears locked thread someone brought up that they have not heard of many people who have had their doors kicked down and been killed by drug law enforcement agencies. Here is a small selection of such individuals for you, but in reality the list is far bigger. Of course all agents responsible must be tried for murder and executed once convicted, indeed even the politicians who have made these atrocities possible must be tried for conspiracy to commit murder and executed once convicted. However the entire DEA is complicit in these crimes, finding an agent without blood on their hands will be no easy task and finding an agent who is not guilty of kidnapping , assault and armed robbery will be impossible. <br /><br />http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/drug-war-victim/

				John Adams<br /><br />64 years old<br />Lebanon, Tennessee<br />October, 2000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Shot to death during a SWAT drug raid while watching TV. The house didn’t match the description on the warrant.<br /><br /><br /><br />Rev. Jonathan Ayers<br /><br />28 years old<br />Toccoa, Georgia<br />September, 2009<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />After meeting with a parishioner who was under surveillance by drug cops, the pastor went to a Convenience store ATM. Coming out, he was confronted by men waving guns. He didn’t know they were undercover cops, and was shot to death while driving off, fearing for his life.<br /><br /><br /><br />Xavier Bennett<br /><br />8 years old<br />Atlanta, Georgia<br />November, 1991<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Xavier was accidentally shot to death by officers in a pre-dawn drug raid during a gunfight with one of Xavier’s relatives.<br /><br /><br /><br />Delbert Bonnar<br /><br />57 years old<br />Belpre, Ohio<br />October, 1998<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Shot 8 times by police in drug raid. They were looking for his son. <br /><br /><br />Veronica Bowers<br /><br />35 years old<br /><br />Charity Bowers<br />7 months old<br />In the air over Peru<br />April, 2001<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />As part of a long-standing arrangement to stop drug shipments, U.S. government tracking provided the information for the Peruvian Air Force to mistakenly shoot down a Cessna plane carrying missionaries. Killed in the incident were Roni Bowers, a missionary with the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism, and her daughter, Charity. In 2008, a new report surfaced indicating widespread problems with the shoot-down program that had been withheld from Congress by the CIA. <br /><br /><br /><br />Rudolfo “Rudy” Cardenas<br /><br />43 years old<br />San Jose, California<br />February, 2004<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Rudy was a father of five who was passing by a house targeted by narcotics officers attempting to serve a parole violation warrant and the police mistakenly thought he was the one they were there to arrest. They chased Cardenas, and he fled, apparently afraid of them (they were not uniformed). Cardenas was shot multiple times in the back.<br /><br />Dorothy Duckett, 78, told the Mercury News she looked out her fifth-floor window after hearing one gunshot and saw Cardenas pleading for his life. “I watched him running with his hands in the air. He kept saying, ‘Don’t shoot. Don’t shoot,’” Duckett said. “He had absolutely nothing in his hands.” <br /><br /><br /><br />Jose Colon<br /><br />20 years old<br />Suffolk, New York<br />April, 2002<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Jose was outside the house where he had come to repay a $20 debt, when a drug raid on the house commenced. He was shot in the head by SWAT. <br /><br /><br /><br />Troy Davis<br /><br />25 years old<br />North Richland Hills, Texas<br />December, 1999<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />During a no-knock raid to find some marijuana plants he was growing, he was shot to death in his living room. There are disputed accounts regarding whether he had a gun. <br /><br /><br /><br />Anthony Andrew Diotaiuto<br /><br />23 years old<br />Sunrise, Florida<br />August, 2005<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Anthony worked two jobs to help pay for the house he lived in with his mother. He had permit for a concealed weapon because of the areas he traveled through for his night job. Sunrise police claimed that he had sold some marijuana, and because they knew he had a legal gun, decided to use SWAT. Neighbors claim that the police did not identify themselves. Police first claimed that Anthony pointed his gun at them, and later changed their story. Regardless, Anthony was dead with 10 bullets in him, and the police found 2 ounces of marijuana. Article. <br /><br /><br /><br />Annie Rae Dixon<br /><br />84 years old<br />Tyler, Texas<br />January, 1993<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Bedridden with pneumonia during a drug raid. Officer kicked open her bedroom door and accidentally shot her. <br /><br /><br /><br />Patrick Dorismond<br /><br />26 years old<br />New York, New York<br />March, 2000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Patrick was a security guard who wanted to become a policeman. He was off-duty and unarmed when he went out with friends. Standing on the street looking for a taxi, he was approached by undercover police who asked to buy some marijuana from him. Patrick was offended by the request (he didn’t use drugs), and a scuffle ensued. Dorismond was then shot to death by the police.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named DorismondPatrick.gif<br /><br /><br /><br />Shirley Dorsey<br /><br />56 years old<br />Placerville, California<br />April, 1991<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Rather than being compelled to testify against her 70-year-old boyfriend (Byron Stamate) for cultivating the medicinal cannabis she depended upon to help control her crippling back pain, Shirley Dorsey committed suicide.&nbsp; She saw it as the only way to prevent the forfeiture of their home and property. Despite her suicide, Stamate was sentenced to 9 months prison, and his home, cottage, and $177,000 life savings were seized. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Juan Mendoza Fernandez<br /><br />60 years old<br />Dallas, Texas<br />September, 2000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Police found a variety of drugs when they raided the Fernandez’ home. However, Juan apparently believed he was the victim of burglars during the raid, and was shot while trying to protect his 11-year-old granddaughter. He and his wife had been married 36 years and had four children and 13 grandchildren. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Curt Ferryman<br /><br />24 years old<br />Jacksonville, Florida<br />August, 2000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Undercover agents were attempting to arrest Ferryman, who was in his car and unarmed. A DEA agent knocked on the car window with his gun to get the suspect’s attention, and the gun went off, killing him as he sat in the car.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Derek Hale<br /><br />25 years old<br />Wilmington, Delaware<br />November, 2006<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />A retired Marine Sergeant who served two tours in Iraq, was peacefully sitting on the front stoop of a house, when police in unmarked cars who had him under surveillance (believing based on his acquaintances that he might be part of a narcotics ring) pulled up and tasered him three times, causing him to go into convulsions and throw up. Because he had not gotten his hand free from his jacket quickly enough (while convulsing) an officer then shot him point blank in the chest with three .40 caliber rounds. Hale’s widow has filed a civil lawsuit.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named halederek.jpg<br />Willie Heard<br /><br />46 years old<br />Osawatomie, Kansas<br />February, 1999<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />SWAT conducted a no-knock drug raid, complete with flash-bang grenades. Heard was shot to death in front of his wife and 16-year-old daughter who had cried for help. Fearing home invasion, he was holding an empty rifle. The raid was at the wrong house.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Clayton Helriggle<br /><br />23 years old<br />Eaton, Ohio<br />September, 2002<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Clayton was shot to death while coming down the stairs during a suprise raid. He was carrying either a gun or a plastic cup, depending on the report. Less than an ounce of marijuana was found.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named HelriggleClayton.gif<br />Esequiel Hernandez<br /><br />18 years old<br />Redford, Texas<br />May, 1997<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Hernandez was shot and killed by a Marine sniper in camouflage who was part of a military unit conducting drug interdiction activities near the Mexican border. Esequiel was out herding his family’s goats and had taken a break to shoot at some tin cans with his antique rifle.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named HernandezEsequial.gif<br />John Hirko<br /><br />21 years old<br />Pennsylvania<br />1997<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />An unarmed man with no prior offenses was shot to death in his house by a squad of masked police. In a no-knock raid, they tossed a smoke grenade in through a window, setting the house on fire. Hirko, suspected of dealing small amounts of marijuana and cocaine, was found face down on his stairway, shot in the back while fleeing the burning building. When the fire was finally put out, officers found some marijuana seeds in an unsinged plastic bag. The Town of Bethlehem settled the resulting lawsuit for $7 million+ and an agreement to reform police department procedures and training.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named hirkojohn.jpg<br />Lynette Gayle Jackson<br /><br />29 years old<br />Riverdale, Georgia<br />September, 2000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Shot to death in her bed by SWAT team.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Kathyrn Johnston<br /><br />88 years old<br />Atlanta, Georgia<br />November, 2006<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Kathryn lived in a rough neighborhood and a relative gave her a gun for protection. When she noticed men breaking through her security bars into her house she fired a shot into the ceiling. They were narcotics officers and fired 39 shots back, killing her. The police had falsified information in order to obtain a no-knock search warrant based on incorrect information from a dealer they had framed. After killing Johnson and realizing that she was completely innocent, they planted some marijuana in the basement. Eventually their stories fell apart federal and state investigations learned the truth. Additional facts have come to light that this was not an isolated incident in the Atlanta police department.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named JohnstonKathryn.jpg<br />Officer Ron Jones<br /><br />29 years old<br />Prentiss, Mississippi<br />December, 2001<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Officer Jones was in the process of serving a drug warrant, based on an informant tip. While trying to enter the rear of a duplex, he broke into the wrong apartment and was shot by the resident, Corey Maye, who had no prior record and was protecting his daughter. No drugs were found. Maye was charged with capital murder, and sentenced to death.<br /><br />Corey Maye was a Drug War Victim waiting to happen. Fortunately, his death sentence was eventually overturned and he is now serving life in prison.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named JonesRon.gif<br />Tony Martinez<br /><br />19 years old<br />De Valle, Texas<br />December, 20001<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Officers conducted a drug raid on a mobile home in De Valle. Martinez, who was not the target of the raid, was asleep on the couch when the raid commenced. Hearing the front door smashed open, he sat up, and was shot to death in the chest.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Peter McWilliams<br /><br />50 years old<br />Laurel Canyon, California<br />June, 2000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named business.gif<br /><br />Peter was a world-famous author and an advocate of medical marijuana, not only because he believed in it in principle, but because it was keeping him alive (he had AIDS and non-Hodgkins lymphoma). After California passed a law legalizing medical marijuana, Peter helped finance the efforts of Todd McCormick to cultivate marijuana for distribution to those who needed it for medical reasons. Federal agents got wind of his involvement, and Peter was a target for his advocacy. He was arrested, and in federal court was prevented from mentioning his medical condition or California’s law. While he was on bail awaiting sentencing, the prosecutors threatened to take away his mother’s house (used for bail) if he failed a drug test, so he stopped using the marijuana which controlled his nausea from the medications and allowed him to keep them down. He was found dead on the bathroom floor, choked to death on his own vomit.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named McWilliamsPeter.gif<br />Ismael Mena<br /><br />45 years old<br />Denver, Colorado<br />September, 1999<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mena was killed when police barged into his house looking for drugs. They had the wrong address.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named MenaIsmael.gif<br />Pedro Oregon Navarro<br /><br />22 years old<br />Houston, Texas<br />July, 1998<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Following up on a tip from a drug suspect, 6 officers crowded into a hallway outside Navarro’s bedroom. When the door opened, one officer shouted that he had a gun. Navarro’s gun was never fired, but officers fired 30 rounds, with 12 of them hitting Pedro. No drugs were found.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Cheryl Noel<br /><br />44 years old<br />Dunkalk, Maryland<br />January, 2005<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Substitute Sunday School Teacher Cheryl Noel possessed a registered handgun, which she kept in her bedroom (9 years earlier, Cheryl has lost her 16-year-old stepdaughter in a shooting murder). On January 19, just before 5 am, police burst into her home using flash-bang grenade and battering ram looking for drugs. Both Cheryl and her husband were asleep in the master bedroom. Suddenly awake and fearing an armed intrusion, Cheryl grabbed her gun. Police kicked in the bedroom door and shot her 3 times.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Mario Paz<br /><br />65 years old<br />Compton, California<br />August, 1999<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Mario was shot twice in the back in his bedroom during a SWAT raid looking for marijuana. No drugs were found.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Charmene Pickering<br /><br />27 years old<br />Brooklyn, New York<br />July, 2001<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Charmene was a passenger in a car driven by a drug suspect. State troopers and DEA agents were in the process of arresting the driver when the trooper’s gun went off and hit Charmene in the neck, killing her. Both passenger and driver were unarmed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Manuel Ramirez<br /><br />Stockton, California<br />January, 1993<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />At 2 am, police smashed down the door and rushed into the home of Manuel Ramirez, a retired golf course groundskeeper. Ramirez awoke, grabbed a pistol and shot and killed officer Arthur Parga before other officers killed him. Police were raiding the house based on a tip that drugs were on the premises, but they found no drugs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Officer Arthur P. Parga<br /><br />32 years old<br />Stockton, California<br />January, 1993<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named PargaArthur.gif<br />Deputy Keith Ruiz<br /><br />36 years old<br />Travis County, Texas<br />February, 2001<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ruiz was a husband and father who was a veteran of numerous SWAT raids. In the process of serving a drug warrant, he was trying to break down the door to a mobile home occupied by painter Edwin Delamora, his wife, and two young children. Confused by the raid at night, Delamora yelled to his wife that they were being robbed and shot through the door, killing Ruiz.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named RuizKeith.gif<br />Donald P. Scott<br /><br />61 years old<br />Malibu, California<br />October, 1992<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Government agencies were interested in the property of this reclusive millionaire. A warrant was issued based on concocted “evidence” of supposed marijuana plantings, and a major raid was conducted with a 32-man assault team. Scott was shot to death in front of his wife. No drugs were found.<br /><br />A later official report found: “It is the District Attorney’s opinion that the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to seize and forfeit the ranch for the government. Based in part upon the possibility of forfeiture, Spencer obtained a search warrant that was not supported by probable cause. This search warrant became Donald Scott’s death warrant.”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named ScottDonald.gif<br />Alberto Sepulveda<br /><br />11 years old<br />Modesto, California<br />September, 2000<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Alberto was killed by a shotgun blast to the back while following police orders and lying face down on the floor during a SWAT raid. He was a seventh-grader at Prescott Senior Elementary School.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named flame.gif<br />Isaac Singletary<br /><br />80 years old<br />Jacksonville, Florida<br />January, 2007<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Isaac lived in a rough neighborhood and often brought out his gun to chase off drug dealers. So when he saw a couple of low-lifes conducting transactions on his lawn, he came out with it again and told them to get off his property. Except they were undercover narcotics officers so they shot him. Isaac managed to get a shot or two off in response, but the officers were able to finish him off.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named SingletaryIsaac.jpg<br />Gary Shepherd<br /><br />45 years old<br />Broadhead, Kentucky<br />August, 1993<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />When a Kentucky drug task force came to uproot his marijuana plants in August 1993, pot-grower and Vietnam vet Gary Shepherd told them, “You will have to kill me first,” took out his rifle and sat down on his front porch.&nbsp; That evening he was shot dead in front of his infant son.&nbsp; Despite the fact that Shepherd never fired a shot and his family was pleading with authorities for negotiations, state police sharpshooters appeared from the brush without warning and opened fire when he refused to drop his rifle.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named ShepherdGary.gif<br />Alberta Spruill<br /><br />57 years old<br />Harlem, New York<br />May, 2003<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Police, acting on a tip, forced their way into Spruill’s home, setting off flash grenades. She suffered a heart attack and died. It was the wrong address.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named SpruillAlberta.gif<br />Ashley Villareal<br /><br />14 years old<br />San Antonio, Texas<br />February, 2003<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Ashley went outside at night with a family friend to move their freshly washed car under shelter. DEA agents, interested in her father, were staking out the house, and believing that her father was driving, shot and killed Ashley. The agents did not have a warrant for her father. Read The Murder of Ashley.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A picture named villareal.jpg<br />Kenneth B. Walker<br /><br />39 years old<br />Columbus, Georgia<br />December, 2003<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Walker and three companions were pulled over in an SUV by police in a drug investigation. No drugs or weapons were found, but Walker was shot in the head. Walker was a devoted husband and father, a respected member of his church, and a 15-year middle-management employee of Blue Cross and Blue Shield.<br /><br />Deputy David Glisson, who killed Walker, was fired three months later for failing to cooperate in an investigation into the shooting.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A picture named WalkerKenneth.jpg<br />Accelyne Williams<br /><br />75 years old<br />Boston, Massachusetts<br />March, 1994<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Accelyne was a retired Methodist Minister and substance abuse counselor. After an informant gave police a bad address, a SWAT raid was conducted on the minster’s home. The door was battered down, Williams was tackled to the floor and his hands tied behind his back. He died of a heart attack.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named WilliamsAccelyne.gif<br />Tarika Wilson<br /><br />26 years old<br />Lima, Ohio<br />January, 2008<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Tarika was a single mother of six. Lima police executed a SWAT raid with guns drawn to arrest her boyfriend on small-time drug dealing charges. Officer Joseph Chavalia was upstairs when the sound of the other officers shooting Wilson’s dogs downstairs startled him. He shot and killed Tarika, who was unarmed, on her knees, holding her 14-month-old son and complying with orders to get down on the floor (her son was shot twice but survived). Chavalia was cleared of any wrong-doing.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named WilsonTarika.jpg<br />Payton &amp; Chase<br /><br /><br />Berwyn Heights, Maryland<br />July, 2008<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Many, many dogs have been slaughtered in drug raids — Payton and Chase are the most famous. Prince George County SWAT, intercepting a package of marijuana addressed to Mayor Cheye Calvo’s wife Trinity, and knowing that criminals were addressing packages to innocents and intercepting them, nonetheless burst into the Mayor’s home without even enough investigation to know he was the Mayor or even notifying local police, shot the two dogs (Chase was running away from them when they killed him), and kept the Mayor and his mother-in-law handcuffed on the floor for hours in their dogs’ blood.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A picture named PaytonChase.jpg<br />While those above were victims of the tactics of the Drug War, there are many others who lost their lives as a result of this war.<br />Isidro Aviles<br /><br />33 years old<br />New York<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Isidro received a 23 year sentence for crack cocaine conspiracy based on $52 cash and the bargained testimony of a repeat criminal. 7 years later he died in prison of an undiagnosed and untreated illness. His mother, Teresa, works tirelessly with the November Coalition, Drop the Rock and others to change the laws and help other families shattered by the war.

				It&#039;s awful how many of these officers suffer no repercussions, however the man protecting himself from an unknown attack gets life in prison. Noone is safe from the efforts of the drug warriors who are motivated by a desire to reenact their old military days on innocent civilians and seize assets.

				Kmfkewm: I just want to point out a few things:<br /><br />You&#039;ve listed some 100 (?)&nbsp; people who have died in this stupid war on drugs. Of course this war if a farce, we all know it, but to list a few people&#039;s names and circumstances of death only personalizes and demonizes your cause. <br /><br />Did you consult those people&#039;s families before you used their tragedy to promote your own vision of death and destruction ? You are advocating for the death of LE associated people right?<br />I just want to remind you that there are other ways to right wrongs that don&#039;t involve mass trials and death.

How would you feel if some stoned kid decided to make a stand and got his ass shot off based on some shit-talk you posted online?&nbsp; Your ideas of revolution and armed insurgency are not new, people have been getting pissed off at authority for valid reasons since the beginning of time.&nbsp; In the past a bunch of farmers would storm the castle with pitchforks (which is about the jist of your plan) and the King&#039;s men would come out and shoot them down. Serious rebellion&nbsp; takes hold when people are truly repressed. When their basic needs are withheld by a ruling class. Not because they or someone they knew couldn&#039;t&nbsp; smoke their dope.<br /><br />The best chance at changing your world for the betterment of your own circumstances and avoiding a lot of unnecessary death is to simply lobby for your cause.

If you had read what I wrote, I was VERY clear moron. <br /><br />The FDA and its &quot;drug requirements&quot; which are a DIRECT result of the WAR on DRUGS are responsible for over 1,000,000 deaths every ten years on average with another 2,000,000 made seriously ill- and thats just in the US, not including foreign nations affected by bad testing protocols and more. <br />http://www.naturalnews.com/035936_FDA_homicide_victims.html<br /><br />The war on drugs must also include the war on alcohol, as the war on drugs technically started with the Harrison Act 1914, (but you would know that right?) and actually started with minor acts in various states and cities as far back as the late 1800&#039;s. <br /><br />Over the last two years alone close to 50,000 people have been killed in various South American countries, including but not limited to Mexico. A direct result of the war on drugs, murdered by DEA no- but I never said that, what I said was the WAR on drugs is responsible for...<br /><br />Cartels and Organized crime in this country and many others ROSE to massive extremes as a direct result of the war on drugs. <br /><br />There are more many more avenues to look when prying back the glued shut eyes of people like you. <br /><br />The toll in deaths, both accidental, and more as well as the toll in prison populations (over 45% of ALL incarcerations in the US are a result of drug related crimes, many being nonviolent) and with over 5 million people in jail or the system...thats allot of people annually. <br />Regardless, I listed a few various sources, other than listing them, I have no desire to prove anything to someone who so obviously is a nationalist at best, fed at worse.

				Hey Liberty,<br />&nbsp;<br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not defending the war on drugs. I think it&#039;s one of the biggest wastes of life, money, resources, time ... etc. Don&#039;t even get me going on wrongful convictions and mistaken raids that end in innocent deaths. What I am saying is (and sorry if I got a little hot under the collar), is that I&#039;m amazed at how quick people are to condemn others to death based on revenge. <br /><br />I know a lot of lives have been ruined, but it&#039;s not like dealers and growers and manufacturers of dope didn&#039;t play a part in their own demise. They all knew that what they were doing was deemed illegal and that if they got caught there would be punishment (severe punishment in the US). They knowingly took risks and some got nailed. They are also players in this game. To spin it any differently is a lie.<br /><br />As far as LE and death go -&nbsp; here&#039;s the rub - They will do exactly what we tell them to do. Notice I said &quot;we&quot; as I still consider myself a part of society for all it&#039;s shite and benefits. If societal attitudes were to change (and they are) then people will pressure politicians to decriminalize, oh say, medical marijuana, which has already happened. Guess what the next step is? Once your Grand-daddy passes on (who probably equates weed with psychotic violent destruction) then the door is open to normalize other types of drugs. <br />So one day when you go down to your local coffee house / drug emporium and get royally stoned out of your head (legally and responsibly of course) you may look at the guy next to you and he may be a cop also getting royally buzzed (off-duty of course). You may find you like this guy who&#039;s just living his life. He might even have stories to tell of the bad old days of &#039;prohibition&#039;.&nbsp; Now imagine pulling out gun and killing him dead. OR you could just get high and debate why humanity is so flawed.

				Your biggest problem is that you think we control the police. The truth is that, had it not been for intense government propaganda, the average citizen wouldn&#039;t give two shits about drug users. Here is the cycle:<br /><br />Government makes propaganda demonizing a subset of the population -&gt; society is conditioned by this propaganda, it is taught in the government schools it is distributed by the mainstream media (and indeed the church is a key player in this conspiracy) -&gt; government creates laws to address the hysteria they have created -&gt; society accepts these laws because of their conditioning -&gt; police enforce the laws <br /><br />you see it this way:<br /><br />Society determines that something is bad -&gt; Society has government make laws against it -&gt; Police enforce these laws<br /><br />In your model, changing the mind of society leads to government removing laws and this to police not enforcing them.In reality the mind of society was set by the government in the first place. It is in the U.S. governments best interests for drugs to remain illegal, they will never decriminalize them. Police are a part of the government. In the end we can simplify this to:<br /><br />Government determines and enforces what is right and wrong , society is largely passive.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />And guess what when the government says it is required for the police to rape children I will not laugh and be friends with the child rapists after society gets things to change. They still need to be punished. They do not get such an easy out as saying &#039;government said to do this!!&#039;.

				Well, you had to do some work to look up that info. on those folks.&nbsp; Sadly we live in a day where the people in charge abuse, intimidate, persecute, set up, and even kill those who would take even a non-violent position and speak out against things.&nbsp; Abuse by police is rampant and just think if people didn&#039;t have video how bad it would be.&nbsp; All those imprisoned for just smoking weed are victims, all those imprisoned for just wanting to get high are victims, and all those imprisoned for selling to others who choose to get high are victims as well.&nbsp; The war on drugs is another media campaign invented by the government to leech money from the people to fight a false war.&nbsp; The society is a victim of their own governments lies about the so called war on drugs.&nbsp; Its a joke man, a bad joke, but still a joke.&nbsp; As far as what to do about it, I&#039;d say get the word out while protecting your identity.&nbsp; Besides, if we had enough resources and muscle to really do something, don&#039;t you think we would have by now?

				The war on drugs is so fake.&nbsp; The reality is; everytime someone lights up, gets high, buys shit, orders from SR, is just another reminder of who is winning.&nbsp; The cops fumble around with catching decoy loads thinking they got &#039;the big one&#039;.&nbsp; Meanwhile a 100x more just got by them.&nbsp; If they go after a plane, there&#039;s tons more going by sea, if they go after a boat, there&#039;s tons more going by land, if they stop a truck, there&#039;s 20 more that just went by.&nbsp; Up yours DEA, lol.

				The solution is to get a powerful enough group that they can use violence to enforce rules without being crushed. But they need to only enforce a single rule, which is nobody can initiate force against others. If people initiate force against others then they need to have escalating force used against them, slightly more than they have used against others. Militant libertarianism is the answer to the problems of the world, provided enough people support it for it to be meaningfully implemented. <br /><br />Suffering is caused by bad humans having power over other humans. Imagine I have a magic notebook and if I write the name of anyone / group / type of person in it then they die. I think in such a case it would be fair to say that I have power over all of humanity, I can kill anyone or even everyone If I want to. However, if I only use this power to kill those who initiate force, despite having power over all of humanity, only bad people will be affected by me. I write the name of the DEA in the book and they all die, so in a way I have caused suffering, but people who do not&nbsp; needlessly fuck over others for their own benefit have nothing to worry about. Is that really such a bad thing then, that I have power over everyone ? <br /><br />People who fuck over others need to be stopped. It doesn&#039;t matter what the majority of people think , they are brainwashed or power hungry themselves. There is no moral need for people who are capable of stopping evil people, to wait for society to say it is okay to stop evil people. <br /><br />The thing is in a libertarian society you are free to select your own defense agency. Who exactly is going to abuse you Astor? All you really say then is that libertarians can not gain enough power to protect themselves from evil people (which mostly boils down to everybody who is not a libertarian, although in their favor some of them are just brainwashed or idiots). <br /><br />I really don&#039;t understand how some of you, like jpinkman, can be so infatuated with the government and statism. To me, the thought of majority rules just makes me cringe. It is like saying you are okay with the holocaust if the majority of people say it is okay, and anybody who tries to stop the execution of the Jews must be terrorists for going against the will of the people. You should realize that democracy is especially dangerous due to the fact that the majority is easily brainwashed, they &#039;think&#039; with their emotions rather than logic and they are largely uneducated on any issues they would be voting on. It is a bunch of greedy, emotional, gullible, mystical, illogical, uneducated people deciding on the fate of themselves and their neighbors, And really they are so easily influenced that it becomes a bunch of sociopathic extremely greedy and fantatical (either to God or the collective) assholes who use the people to meet their own goals. <br /><br />I am not at all for democracy. First of all, nobody has any right to tell me what to do so long as I mind my own business and don&#039;t fuck with other people. That alone is enough to justify me not bowing to the state, even if the majority of dumb fucks think that I should. Additionally, when the masses are ostensibly in charge (although they never are in reality, considering they are easily manipulated by the elites), they make stupid choices that result in not only me being oppressed, but in god damn everybody except the select few being oppressed. The elites can split society up into a thousand minority groups and get the majority to turn against them. But oh noez everybody is part of some minority group, so it is divide and conquer. <br /><br />The solution is to take power away from the elites and away from the people, and to violently enforce libertarianism. Nobody has any reason to bitch about this happening, libertarianism permits everybody to do whatever the fuck they want so long as they do not initiate force against others. The people who do not want enforced libertarianism ALL fall into one of the following camps:<br /><br />1. They want to steal money from others (&quot;I am entitled to free health care and other shit!!111&quot;)<br />2. They want to tell other people what to do (&quot;No drugs for you! No gay marriage for you! Worship my God or else!!!!&quot;) <br /><br />it is that fucking simple. Because the majority of people want to hold a gun to their neighbors head and steal their shit, or hold a gun to their head and make them worship their God, or hold a gun to their head and make them follow their moral compass, they are against libertarianism. So only evil people are against libertarianism. Nobody is against libertarianism because they are afraid they will be oppressed, because there is absolutely no other ideology that is as freedom loving as libertarianism. No moral ideology can possibly be more freedom oriented than &#039;do whatever the fuck you want just don&#039;t hurt anybody other than yourself in the process&#039;. <br /><br />We need to have global libertarianism, and the people enforcing it need to gain so much power over the world that there is absolutely no chance of them ever losing it, democracy and the government and everybody else be damned. <br /><br />

When she noticed men breaking through her security bars into her house she fired a shot into the ceiling. They were narcotics officers and fired 39 shots back, killing her. The police had falsified information in order to obtain a no-knock search warrant based on incorrect information from a dealer they had framed. After killing Johnson and realizing that she was completely innocent, they planted some marijuana in the basement.

After California passed a law legalizing medical marijuana, Peter helped finance the efforts of Todd McCormick to cultivate marijuana for distribution to those who needed it for medical reasons. Federal agents got wind of his involvement, and Peter was a target for his advocacy. He was arrested, and in federal court was prevented from mentioning his medical condition or California’s law. While he was on bail awaiting sentencing, the prosecutors threatened to take away his mother’s house (used for bail) if he failed a drug test, so he stopped using the marijuana which controlled his nausea from the medications and allowed him to keep them down.

The most effective way to protest the war on drugs is to cause mass casualties in those who enforce the drug laws.

The entire country is victimized by the war on drugs, a trillion dollars has been spent fighting a completely pointless and doomed to fail war that has accomplished jack fucking shit. What could we have spent a TRILLION dollars on instead? Maybe eradicating poverty? Maybe having a better education system? Better healthcare system? I mean, I am against taxation entirely, but it sure seems like we could have spent a trillion dollars on something more useful than building a bunch of prisons to lock up harmless drug users.

We are not oppressed only because we cannot &quot;smoke our dope&quot; we are oppressed because we are sent to die in motherfucking prisons by armed to the teeth paramilitary troops who spy on us and treat us like motherfucking enemy combatants.

You are literally arguing that because they knew the risks of continuing to practice their faith, and yet they continued to do so, that THEY are responsible for being gassed at concentration camps, rather than the Nazi war criminals.

				kmfewm - I love you man, you are without a doubt my favorite extremist. You&#039;re very smart, academically inclined., and probably a 23 yr old poli-sci student who has all the answers in a cartoon-ish black and white world of &#039;Jew&#039; and &#039;Nazi&#039; characters. You provide simplistic scenarios to complex human situations. You probably have big &#039;ol bunny eyes and a beautiful round head. Oh, if I could only pinch those naive young cheeks whilst gazing on you with awe and wonderment ... *ahem* on with my rebuttal;<br /><br />It&#039;ll take to long to address the essay you wrote so I&#039;ll sum it up with glib short to-the-point sentences:<br /><br />Yes, laws can be &quot;muddy as fuck&quot;, that is why the courts exist, to interpret them as best they can, as given to each case presented. It is not perfect, many many miscarriages of justice have occurred, in my country as well as yours (I&#039;m assuming you&#039;re an American), but it is so far the best system I can see. Do you have a better one in mind? One that doesn&#039;t result in dictatorial tribalism gone amuck ?&nbsp; Please share. <br /><br />I don&#039;t believe that any law is God-like (they can and do change often) but I generally respect the laws of my country, most of them anyway, I do smoke a blunt here and there and if I got caught I would respect the law and pay the fine, just as I would a parking ticket. I&#039;m hardly apathetic to my government, I make sure I hold them accountable to their actions by participating in the system, not screaming for blood and death. If there is an obvious wrong committed by my government OR something I disagree with I protest it and more often that not the government listens. NOTE - this does not mean I always get my way, part of what defines living in a democratic and free country means that I don&#039;t get my way all the time. <br /><br />Equating the Jehovah Witness religion in Nazi Germany with drug dealing in the US is .. ludicrous. I can&#039;t seriously comment on it. <br /><br />I agree with you when you say that if we write &quot;fifty fucking letters tomorrow (sic) it wouldn&#039;t change a single god damn fucking thing&quot;.

Perhaps the 2 main established parties would recognize the core of your support (assuming you have any real support for your ideals) and start to integrate those principles into their ideology.

You have bought the propaganda hook line and sinker. The entire system is stacked against us. Can I teach a pro legalization class at public schools? Can I tax people and spend the money promoting drug legalization? Do I have friends making trillions of dollars, large parts of which they donate back to me, due to drug criminalization? You seem to advocate that we fight a shark in the water. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yes, laws can be &quot;muddy as fuck&quot;, that is why the courts exist, to interpret them as best they can, as given to each case presented.

My guess is that you probably watch School House Rock &#039;I&#039;m just a bill&#039; for your evenings entertainment. The laws are intentionally muddy as fuck so that they can apply to anything the government wants them to apply to. Many of the laws that are not muddy as fuck are interpreted away by secret courts anyway. Of course the system I prefer is militant libertarianism, where a large and powerful group uses whatever force necessary to enforce the ideals of libertarianism. However, I can think of a great many systems far superior to what is currently in place. I would prefer a direct democracy that requires a substantial percentage of the population to back something prior to it being made law. I think that computers and encryption systems should be used more frequently in voting processes, giving everybody an easy ability to vote. I don&#039;t think that there should be a president or a congress. I don&#039;t think there should be state laws either. Let&#039;s implement a secure voting infrastructure and then strike all laws from the books. Then we will let people propose laws by getting a significant amount of support for the law to be considered. If a law is nominated for consideration, it is put up to a vote for a period of two weeks. If 80% of the people who vote on the law vote in favor of it, then it is passed as law, otherwise it is not passed as law. There must be a period of four years prior to a law being reevaluated after it is put into place or rejected. Courts should be changed as well, the first thing the jury should decide is whether or not the alleged crime is something that they consider should be criminal. If 80% of the jury determines that it should be criminal, then the case can proceed, otherwise it is dismissed immediately. The jury should also decide the appropriate sentence for the crime, not the judge and not any federal or state mandates. 80% of people will agree that it should be illegal to murder, it should be illegal to rape, it should be illegal to steal, etc. You will be much more hard pressed to find 80% of people who think somebody should go to prison for smoking marijuana. If 20% or more of the population doesn&#039;t think something should be illegal, it probably shouldn&#039;t be. Currently 50.00000001% of people (well, roughly, considering electoral college) determine some percentage of the leaders who are put into power, and the leaders put into power can essentially do whatever the hell they want. The leaders put into power also get to select some of the other leaders put into power. Currently we vote on who gets to be a part of the aristocracy, we rarely get to directly influence anything ourselves. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t believe that any law is God-like (they can and do change often) but I generally respect the laws of my country, most of them anyway, I do smoke a blunt here and there and if I got caught I would respect the law and pay the fine, just as I would a parking ticket.

Just kill people instead. <br /><br />You still talk about Martyrs with the voice of a radical, like your crying tantrum is paramount to everything else. Other people lives don&#039;t matter cause YOUR vision should take precedence over everyone else and you will resort to violence for all,&nbsp; if you don&#039;t get your way.<br /><br />I maintain that if you feel your fundamental values aren&#039;t being represented by any government party then start your own. This would take conviction, integrity and lots of grassroots support. It would be hard work, it would not be as cool as yelling for death and destruction. Just an FYI.&nbsp; &nbsp;

They try to control my ability to use drugs, they try to control what I can spend my money on by spending it &quot;for&quot; me, they try to restrict what I can look at, they try to restrict a fuck load of my life actually. This is all quite objective as well, you merely need to crack open a law book to see what all &quot;they&quot; are trying to control. Governments come and go year after year sure, when is the last time the USA had a president who was not part of the democrat or republican party? 1850! We have the choice between religious extremists and communists, and you make it seem like this means that we have freedom. Yay, we get to pick whether we are ass raped with a broom handle or a giant dildo! If we would prefer not to be sodomized we can of course write letters to our rapists asking them to please stop, I am sure they will listen. My unwavering crusade for anarchy is inseparable from my unwavering crusade for total freedom from oppression. It is not at all based on fear. The people who are afraid are the ones who support having a strong government, they are afraid of poverty and discrimination or of tolerance for those who go against their religion, and they need a powerful government to force others to conform to their political ideology. That is the difference between liberalism and conservatism versus libertarianism, liberals want to force people to accept others and force people to support others and conservatives want to force people to conform to their religious morality, whereas libertarians only want to force people to stop forcing other people to do shit! It is not possible to compare libertarianism to conservatism or liberalism because they are truly inverse ideologies, libertarianism is about freedom whereas liberalism and conservatism are just two different flavors of oppression. Also, I agree that there is no grand dictator, it is more like a council of power elites, encompassing the richest corporate leaders, the political aristocracy and their generals in military and law enforcement. The common man is given only an illusion of freedom, an illusion that you are experiencing to the point that it has caused you to be truly delusional. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Yeah, life ain&#039;t perfect, every now and then in real life a corruption scandal occurs and shows us that greed, ego, deception and avarice are an inherent human traits.

I maintain that I have not been victimized by anyone or anything. I get up and go to work, I pay taxes, I enjoy my life, sometimes I do drugs. I don&#039;t always agree with what my taxes fund but I do respect the legitimacy of an elected government to do what they believe is best. If enough of us don&#039;t like it we simply vote them out.

				There once was a time when a crime was considered a &quot;Felony&quot; because it was of the nature where the perpetrator would basically be a real danger to society, and the label of &quot;felon&quot; was reserved for those who committed murder, rape, robbery, and other actions that directly harmed (physically and/or financially) or in some way damaged the livelyhood, reputation or self-respect of one or more other persons.&nbsp; A person convicted of a felony was generally a dangerous person, and even if/when they were released from prison and had successfully completed a phase of being on parole, they would never be able to return to society and live a so called &quot;normal&quot; life.&nbsp; A good part of this being due to that in many or all states, a convicted felon was no longer able to exercise their right to vote, their second amendment right to own a gun would never be restored (which may have made sense back when those convicted of a felony were convicted as such because they truly were dangerous and had used violence against others and might do so again).<br /><br />Prior to the made up &quot;war on drugs&quot; convicted felons made up a relatively small portion of society at large.&nbsp; Once the WOD and all the new and extremely broad laws that accompanied it became official, that ratio changed drastically.&nbsp; Given, there have been, are and will be some people who will go through an entire lifetime completely unscathed by the WOD in any way, probably remaining mostly oblivious to it as well.&nbsp; But most people at some point in their lifetime have already or will become a victim of it either directly, or indirectly as a family member, friend, or other relationship to the direct victim, and to varying degrees - depending on each persons circumstances, will experience a negative impact on their life that would not otherwise occur.&nbsp; And while plenty of murders, rapes and other violent crimes go unsolved...&nbsp; &nbsp;no person accused of committing any infraction of a drug law (whether or not they actually did), shall go unpunished.... and that punishment, regardless of the extent of it and how it&#039;s carried out, once deemed to be a convicted felon - the majority of those drug war victims labeled as felons have never harmed anyone or shown that they ever intend to - the label will follow them for the rest of their natural life and make it impossible or at best very difficult to return to the same lifestyle that was taken for granted prior to accusation day.&nbsp; The same restrictions will apply to these people as do to the murders and rapists of society.&nbsp; Their right to vote taken away for a period of time ranging from equal to that which they spent incarcerated plus the time spent on parole (or if not physically incarcerated, the time equal to that which was spent on probation, in drug courts and any other court ordered federally financed &quot;programs&quot;) to the rest of their life - depending on which state they are in and the current voting eligibility laws of said state. They will never again have a right to exercise their 2nd ammendment right - regardless if there was no violence or gun involved or related to their accusation day.&nbsp; They will be no longer even considered for many jobs that they are otherwise qualified for...&nbsp; making it difficult or even impossible to legally support themseves and their families.&nbsp; This is especially detrimental to those who had held a professional degree - such as a doctor or lawyer or any other occupation that requires an advanced degree and a license, as all drug war victims are automatifcally stripped of all government issued licenses - it&#039;s not limited to just their drivers license which is also completely unfair to take away especially when the DW victim often isn&#039;t even in a vehicle at the time of accusation.&nbsp; Although drivers licenses can usually at some point be legally restored, other licenses that are necessary for those who earned them for their chosen profession are not so easy to restore.<br /><br />Not everyone has or will become a victim of the drug war, but everyone is vulnerable to become one (directly or indirectly) at any time, in any place.&nbsp; Sadly, most people don&#039;t concern themselves with something that &quot;only happens to other people&quot;...&nbsp; until it happens to them.&nbsp; But then it&#039;s too late as once the accusation is made, their quality of life will never be the same.&nbsp; And being that they will forever after be stripped of many of the rights and privileges they once took for granted, the window of opportunity to have possible been an effective part of a solution will have closed for good &gt;:(

				Some of the most astonishing naivete ever in this thread. I agree that it makes our community look bad. If I didn&#039;t know better, I&#039;d say this was a false flag operation, it&#039;s actually disturbing that it&#039;s not.<br /><br />@wackamnblu - you must have a lot of free time to try that hard to explain common sense. there&#039;s no explaining nuance to anyone who will only see black and white.<br /><br /><br />FWIW I&#039;d support seizing LE pensions and vacations properties as reparations. <br /><br />I have also publicly advocated at townhalls or all-candiates forums: complete legalization to federal and provincial level types, and total non-enforcement on a municipal / local / county level. I&#039;ve never faced any negative consequences for doing so, and I am well-known in my community as the opinionated guy who is in favor of drug legalization and against environmentalists and in favor of family law reform and against Indian-owned casino development and so on. None of those are mainstream issues, and I&#039;ve never even gotten a dirty look from a cop or the mayor or a hospital administrator or any representative of state power for holding any of those views. Hell, I have a long criminal record (only partially for drugs) and have been bankrupt and nobody oppresses me for it. The only real consequence I&#039;ve faced is not getting in to the USA. There is simply no truth to some of the hyperbole expressed above.<br /><br />I believe that the sad reality is that the War on Drugs has lasted so long is because a substantial part of the population supports it, at least in part or in theory. There is no pro-Government oppressor class vs pro-freedom enslaved class. That sort of clear dichotomy simply doesn&#039;t exist.

It is pretty well established that the US government spends billions of dollars a year on propaganda targeted at its own citizens<br /><br />B. It is pretty well established that drug users, and others who are not doing anything against libertarianism, are systematically hunted down and enslaved<br /><br />C. It is pretty obvious that writing letters is not going to stop this from happening<br /><br />D. I am upset about far more than the drug war. We are also taxed which is theft, we also have all of our rights routinely violated, people are sent to prison for looking at the wrong pictures, etc. I am upset because the government has restricted the freedom of and enslaved the entire population. <br /><br />E. Although I do not plan to go on a suicidal DEA killing rampage, I certainly would have no issue with pressing a magic button that causes all DEA agents heads to instantaneously explode.&nbsp; <br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />If by propaganda you mean advertising and &quot;awareness&quot; campaigns then yeah I suppose your government may sanction that, I&#039;m not sure as I don&#039;t reside there. But surely you don&#039;t think that overall people are stupid enough to eat it all up hook line and sinker? Clearly they don&#039;t as many many people still use drugs. This however is where the real battle occurs if you could counter the propaganda with awareness campaigns of your own that showcase only the facts about drug consumption than you&#039;d be a respectable force in the war on drugs. I promise you, no Nazis will kick in your door and drag you into the night for promoting this vision. <br /><br />Drug dealers are still jailed, yes. They are not enslaved (although I admire your verbal attempt at propaganda). Enslavement would mean an entire lifetime of working for no wages. They would never get out of prison, yet the vast majority of drug related offender do get out within a few years. Still sucks, I&#039;m not debating that this is a good thing, but &quot;The Government&quot; did not put them there. Existing laws that are transparent for all to see, are responsible for drug related incarcerations. Change the law and you change the destiny of these people. Laws do change everyday, this is not impossible. <br /><br />Writing letters accompanied by high profile protests, demonstrations and lobbying do change things. This is a fact. The only debatable part is how much public support can be gotten and how much push back do you get from people with opposing views. I suppose if you had a magic button to press that would simply kill everyone that you disagreed with that would work too. Better hope they don&#039;t also have that magic button .. <br /><br />Equating taxation to theft is just stupid. Did you use the roads today? Ever needed a hospital or ride in public transit? Has the Fire Department ever assisted someone in your neighborhood? - taxation in its best form is a way to re-distribute wealth for the public good. No one person is going to agree with every single thing that tax dollars are allotted to.&nbsp; This is the crux of politics - how to collect and spend tax dollars. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=53385.msg1312624#msg1312624">Quote from: kmfkewm on July 07, 2013, 04:14 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I mean, I can list a lot of things that the government tries to control. They try to control my ability to use drugs, they try to control what I can spend my money on by spending it &quot;for&quot; me, they try to restrict what I can look at, they try to restrict a fuck load of my life actually. This is all quite objective as well, you merely need to crack open a law book to see what all &quot;they&quot; are trying to control. Governments come and go year after year sure, when is the last time the USA had a president who was not part of the democrat or republican party? 1850! We have the choice between religious extremists and communists, and you make it seem like this means that we have freedom. Yay, we get to pick whether we are ass raped with a broom handle or a giant dildo! If we would prefer not to be sodomized we can of course write letters to our rapists asking them to please stop, I am sure they will listen. My unwavering crusade for anarchy is inseparable from my unwavering crusade for total freedom from oppression. It is not at all based on fear. The people who are afraid are the ones who support having a strong government, they are afraid of poverty and discrimination or of tolerance for those who go against their religion, and they need a powerful government to force others to conform to their political ideology. That is the difference between liberalism and conservatism versus libertarianism, liberals want to force people to accept others and force people to support others and conservatives want to force people to conform to their religious morality, whereas libertarians only want to force people to stop forcing other people to do shit! It is not possible to compare libertarianism to conservatism or liberalism because they are truly inverse ideologies, libertarianism is about freedom whereas liberalism and conservatism are just two different flavors of oppression. Also, I agree that there is no grand dictator, it is more like a council of power elites, encompassing the richest corporate leaders, the political aristocracy and their generals in military and law enforcement. The common man is given only an illusion of freedom, an illusion that you are experiencing to the point that it has caused you to be truly delusional. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Your understanding of government is blurred. I don&#039;t think you can differentiate the difference between current laws and a sitting government. To you they seem the same. While a government is capable of creating laws, no one branch dictates them. I won&#039;t get into how its all setup but there are many checks and balances to ensure that no one entity - legislative, judicial, or executive, has monopolistic control over law making. It sounds though like you believe that there are simply to many existing laws that restrict your freedom to .. *lets take a look at what you wrote* ...&nbsp; &quot;.. look at what you want&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what has been denied to you in this arena. The only thing I can think of would be child pornography, of which I think the vast majority of people will agree, is harmful to children and ought to be illegal under any political system. Aside from that, maybe you should campaign to eliminate or alter existing laws. But I get the sense that even that would not be enough for you only because you so casually espouse extremism with words like enslavement, oppression, fascism and the whole Nazi/Jew thing. I fear you&#039;re a radical zealot now. That you will never look at the over-all big picture or integrate into a system that encourages your participation. You will only be satisfied when people die, or when only your vision is imposed on everyone else.

When you have one of the richest most powerful governments in the world dumping billions of dollars into anti-drug propaganda, and using their ability to control school curriculum to spread their propaganda as well, and using their influence over the media to spread propaganda as well, and using their influence over which publishing scientists gets grants as well, you bet your god damn ass that it has an overall effect on people. Thinking otherwise just exposes your complete and total naivety, you really live in such a fucking fantasy world that it literally sickens me thinking that there are people out there who are as completely drunk on the kool aid as you are. I really wish you were just a troll! Additionally, many people drink Pepsi even though Coca Cola spends billions of dollars on advertising, but if Coca Cola did not advertise it is essentially proven that a fucking lot of people would start drinking Pepsi who currently drink Coca Cola. I highly suggest that you go to school and take a marketing 101 class.<br /><br />Yes countering propaganda with true education (hell, or even with more propaganda!) is an effective strategy that I entirely support. Guess what though, the military and intelligence agencies (CIA in particular) are heavily involved in spreading propaganda in foreign countries, but it doesn&#039;t mean that they stop killing the enemy soldiers! Also you are naive as hell to think that drug legalization activists are not singled out and targeted by the US Gestapo. I already know you will argue that they are not arrested for being drug activists but rather for being drug users, but only a truly blind idiot would think that the activism is not what causes them to be singled out for further investigation.<br /><br />http://www.ktvb.com/news/politics/Medical-marijuana-activists-children-taken-from-home-charges-pending-204966741.html<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">BOISE -- Three publicly known medical marijuana advocates say police took their sons away from them this week while investigating allegations involving marijuana. Their sons were considered by law enforcement to be in imminent danger.<br /><br />The medical marijuana advocacy group called &quot;Compassionate Idaho&quot; has appeared in several recent news stories as members have circulated petitions looking for a vote to legalize medical marijuana. Now, its leaders are being investigated, and they say their kids were put into foster care.<br /><br />&quot;They took my children. Due to cannabis being present in the house,&quot; Lindsey Rinehart, Compassionate Idaho&#039;s Executive Director, said.<br /><br />Lindsey and Josh Rinehart and Sarah Caldwell have been very public in their efforts to legalize medical marijuana. On Tuesday, they say when they got back to the Rinehart&#039;s after a trip -- their baby-sitter was there, but their four sons were all gone.<br /><br />&quot;They say their goal is to return our children to our home once it is deemed safe. They say our children will be in foster care for 30 days,&quot; Lindsey Rinehart said.<br />&nbsp;<br />According to the search warrant Rinehart showed KTVB, her home was being investigated for possible charges of marijuana trafficking, possession and injury to a child. She vehemently denies trafficking or putting kids in danger.<br /><br />&quot;We were not dealing. We were not buying. We were not selling. We were not growing,&quot; Rinehart said.<br /><br />Caldwell&#039;s two sons are back with her now, but the Rineharts say their two boys are still in foster care. The activists say everything started at their kids&#039; elementary school earlier this week.<br /><br />&quot;Somebody said that somebody brought cannabis to school, that somebody ate the cannabis, that somebody reported it. That it was tossed around on the playground,&quot; Sarah Caldwell said.<br /><br />Lindsey Rinehart continued their story: &quot;So they decided basically, who would have cannabis in their home. Now if you&#039;re the chief petitioner to legalize medical marijuana, where would you go with that?&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The Rineharts say police then searched their home, seized marijuana, and took their children, declared in imminent danger.<br /><br />&quot;They went through my house. They removed all of my cannabis that I use for medicine,&quot; Lindsey Rinehart said. Rinehart suffers from Multiple Sclerosis.<br /><br />The Rineharts say their kids have been well-educated about marijuana, that it is medicine not for them to touch. Now, Lindsey Rinehart says she&#039;s personally given up medical marijuana. She says her MS symptoms have already started to return.<br /><br />&quot;Even if I could access cannabis, which I can&#039;t, and won&#039;t because I&#039;m cooperating with CPS, I want my children back. I&#039;m going to have to go back on a whole bunch of really toxic medication,&quot; Lindsey Rinehart said.<br /><br />Though she says she will not be keeping marijuana around because her priority is doing anything to get her children back. She does plan, alongside the others, to keep fighting for legalization.<br /><br />&quot;We are going to work on getting our children back. And we are going to work on education. And we are going to work on getting medical marijuana laws in Idaho so this doesn&#039;t happen to any more people,&quot; Lindsey Rinehart said.<br />&nbsp;<br />No charges have been filed in this case. Because of that, Boise Police said it could not offer much information; however, a spokeswoman did confirm officers are currently working on the case with prosecutors, who will determine if any charges will be filed.<br /><br />KTVB contacted Health and Welfare on this story. While a spokesman could not comment on a specific case, he did offer insight about guidelines for recommending a child be removed from a home.<br /><br />The spokesman said if illegal drugs are found in a home, they look at whether they&#039;re accessible to the kids. They also look at if drug activity impacts ability to parent. Police make decisions on if kids need to be taken, and he said the courts work with agency recommendations to determine the return of children.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The Rineharts and Caldwell say other medical marijuana advocates have started to reach out to them and have so far donated more than $5,000 to help pay for legal expenses.

They would never get out of prison, yet the vast majority of drug related offender do get out within a few years. Still sucks, I&#039;m not debating that this is a good thing, but &quot;The Government&quot; did not put them there. Existing laws that are transparent for all to see, are responsible for drug related incarcerations. Change the law and you change the destiny of these people. Laws do change everyday, this is not impossible. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It is not propaganda to say that drug users are enslaved! If somebody is put into a prison cell and told when to wake up, told when to eat, told what they can and cannot do, and they have their freedom highly restricted, then they are fucking enslaved! Not to mention that at many prisons you are essentially forced to work for literally pennies an hour if you want any pseudo-luxuries at all, like pieces of candy instead of bland oatmeal for breakfast, a cheese sandwich for lunch and a bowl of soup for dinner. So you think that the blacks who were freed from slavery prior to their deaths were never really slaves? I am pretty sure that would be widely rejected by all sane people. One does not need to have been a slave for a lifetime to have been enslaved, and thinking otherwise is just God damn ridiculous. Also you seriously must be fucking with me to say that the government did not put drug users in prison. Did the Nazis not put Jehovah Witnesses in the gas chambers, because they CHOSE to not renounce their faith? It is a perfect analogy in this case, and indeed I suspect that you will once again continue to act so offender by this perfect analogy that you don&#039;t even try to counter it. What you are saying is analogous to saying that the Jehovah Witnesses put themselves in the gas chambers and that we should not hold the Nazi war criminals responsible for what they did.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Equating taxation to theft is just stupid. Did you use the roads today? Ever needed a hospital or ride in public transit?

Talk about philosophically inconsistent and totally unprincipled, or perhaps just straight up fucktarded I suppose. Roads can be privatized, hospitals are largely privatized, public transit is largely privatized, fire departments can be largely privatized. All of these arguments are boring, old, unoriginal and fucking straight up stupid as shit. In Soviet Russia the government made the shoes, are you telling me that we should be taxed because otherwise who will make the shoes? Yeah essentially you are, and it honest to God just makes you sound like a fucking idiot. <br /><br />

I don&#039;t think you can differentiate the difference between current laws and a sitting government. To you they seem the same. While a government is capable of creating laws, no one branch dictates them. I won&#039;t get into how its all setup but there are many checks and balances to ensure that no one entity - legislative, judicial, or executive, has monopolistic control over law making.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Yes the king, his wife and their children all can work together to pass the laws! Freedom! Checks and balances! First of all there are only two main political parties, and they agree on 90% of the issues, and they make damn sure that no other political party has a snowballs chance in hell of gaining any significant power at all, and they also all collude with the police. You are damn naive as hell if you think that there are really checks and balances. You totally buy into the idealistic image that is presented to you rather than looking through the lies and seeing the fucking reality of the matter. First of all the various branches select who is part of the other branches to some extent, the Supreme court judges (who are insanely powerful) are nominated by the president and then confirmed by the senate. The president is whoever the electoral college selects from either the Democrat or Republican party. It is a fucking oligarchy and only a fool would think otherwise. No one entity has control over law making, but two parties have 100% complete control between them, and it is also theoretically possible for a single party to obtain complete control as well. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> It sounds though like you believe that there are simply to many existing laws that restrict your freedom to .. *lets take a look at what you wrote* ...&nbsp; &quot;.. look at what you want&quot;.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure what has been denied to you in this arena. The only thing I can think of would be child pornography, of which I think the vast majority of people will agree, is harmful to children and ought to be illegal under any political system.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Look, I am not going to turn this into a victims of the war on CP thread because we have already had enough of those. So I will keep my response to this concise. The constitution of the United States of America promises freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The Supreme Court said that child pornography is not protected speech, because:<br /><br />1. The government has a very compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation of children.<br /><br />Viewing child pornography is not sexually exploiting children. I imagine that the government also has a very compelling interest in preventing the violent exploitation of adults, but the Supreme Court has never said that it is illegal to view videos of people being murdered. For that matter, the government has a compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation of adults, but there are no specific laws against rape pornography featuring those over the age of 18, rather they must first be classified as obscenity (obscenity laws are another violation of the right to free speech). Let&#039;s see what the Webster dictionary, the authority on English words, has to say about the word exploiting:<br /><br />A. To make use of selfishly or unethically: a country that exploited peasant labor. <br /><br />It is a bit of a stretch to say that viewing child pornography is making use of children selfishly or unethically. Making use of their images perhaps, but the people making use of the children are the pornographers themselves. The matter of ethics is entirely subjective, but the argument that every time a picture of CP is viewed it causes the depicted child to be molested all over again, is purely rubbish. There is nothing unethical about viewing an image of anything, and I would love to know why it is unethical to view a self taken picture of a 17 year old girl flashing her mirror but it is ethical to view a picture of the genocide of millions of people. Doesn&#039;t the government have a compelling interest in preventing the genocidal exploitation of the masses? <br /><br />B. To advertise; promote.<br /><br />Advertising and promoting are actually entirely different from viewing. If I view a major motion picture it does not mean that I am advertising it or promiting it. <br /><br />2. Distribution of visual depictions of children engaged in sexual activity is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children. The images serve as a permanent reminder of the abuse, and it is necessary for government to regulate the channels of distributing such images if it is to be able to eliminate the production of child pornography.<br /><br />Distribution is different from viewing, and in fact even distribution of visual depictions of children engaged in sexual activity is not intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children. For example, it is illegal to view a self taken image of a 17 year old flashing her camera phone. In some cases the images are not even documenting abuse by any stretch of the imagination, also images of the holocaust serve as a permanent reminder of mass genocide but any sane person would agree that it is unconstitutional for the government to ban such images. Additionally, it is very clear that it is not necessary to attack distributors or viewers of child pornography in order to prevent child sexual abuse, and various leading experts on the subject have stated quite clearly that there is no evidence for the market model of child pornography leading to abuse, the groups involved in production and possession are very distinct with little overlap, and indeed having channels through which child pornography is made available has led to LOWER levels of child molestation in EVERY STUDIED COUNTRY WHERE CP POSSESSION IS LEGAL. <br /><br />3. Advertising and selling child pornography provides an economic motive for producing child pornography.<br /><br />Sure, and advertising and selling child pornography have absolutely nothing to do with viewing child pornography. It should be illegal to fund the molestation of children, it should be illegal to instruct others to molest children, but it is *clearly* unconstitutional to restrict a persons ability to view child pornography. Just nobody gives a fuck because they are so against it. So even when we have CLEAR CONSTITUTIONAL COMMANDMENTS protecting peoples right to view child pornography, the Supreme Court can just interpret the constitution away as they see fit. It is actually a PERFECT example of the government being in total control and the people having their constitutional rights blatantly violated. <br /><br />4. Visual depictions of children engaged in sexual activity have negligible artistic value.<br /><br />This is entirely subjective and not even true. Visual depictions of children engaged in sexual activity can very well have significant artistic value. In many cases it will not have artistic value IN MY OPINION, but it is entirely possible for it to. In fact, I believe there are several images of nude underage children that have been declared as legal by the courts and not child pornography due to the fact that they were recognized as having artistic value. In non CP related cases of obscenity it is up to a randomly selected Jury to determine if a given image or video is obscene (although obscenity laws are also clearly unconstitutional). <br /><br />5. Thus, holding that child pornography is outside the protection of the First Amendment is consistent with the Court&#039;s prior decisions limiting the banning of materials deemed &quot;obscene&quot; as the Court had previously defined it. For this reason, child pornography need not be legally obscene before being outlawed.<br /><br />So because according to the Supreme Court all CP is inherently obscene, it does not need to be found as obscene by a jury, unlike all other obscenity. Something tells me you will be hard pressed to find a jury that thinks pictures of teenagers flashing their mirrors are particularly obscene, but the Supreme Court decided that in cases of CP it doesn&#039;t matter what the jury thinks because they have determined that all nude or sexualized images of anyone under the age of 18 are inherently obscene (oh but feel free to fuck the shit out of 16 and 17 year olds if you live in over half of the USA, just don&#039;t take pictures of it because that is definitely obscene and abuse and omfg). <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Aside from that, maybe you should campaign to eliminate or alter existing laws. But I get the sense that even that would not be enough for you only because you so casually espouse extremism with words like enslavement, oppression, fascism and the whole Nazi/Jew thing. I fear you&#039;re a radical zealot now. That you will never look at the over-all big picture or integrate into a system that encourages your participation. You will only be satisfied when people die, or when only your vision is imposed on everyone else. Go ahead and wish for your magic button. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Hell maybe I should campaign to eliminate or alter the existing unconstitutional freedom restricting uneducated ill founded CP laws. the war on drugs is a tragedy but the war on people who view CP is even worse as they are given life long sentences and labels and it is just as completely fucking baseless and propagandized as the war on drugs is. Campaigning to end the war on drugs or the war on CP viewers is borderline a waste of time for all of the reasons I already stated, not to mention the largest groups of people who would support me are BANNED FROM VOTING. You are essentially saying that I should rally for changes in laws that if people break they are BANNED FROM VOTING. Do you get that? People with felony drug charges CANNOT VOTE IN THE MAJORITY OF THE USA, SOMETIMES FOR LIFE. You say that we are free to campaign and get the laws changed, sorry as soon as we are drug felons we cannot do shit to directly influence politics. I am not espousing extremism I am espousing the simple fucking facts of the matter.

The things used as currency will likely be backed by gold or mathematically ensured scarcity such as Bitcoin. These things would already be major competition to the dollar if not for the fact that the US government demands its protection money be paid to it in dollars, and makes life difficult as fuck for anybody who has any financial instrument that it cannot easily control. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t actually ask for permission when I smoke a blunt.

If I am caught smoking a blunt I could very well go to jail for several months, during which time I will not be free to go about my life, which to me seems to pretty clearly indicate that I will be fucking enslaved. I will be told what to eat, when to wake up and what to do all day. Additionally, I will need to pay fines and pay to attend all kinds of classes that I don&#039;t want to go to (propaganda classes...or should I say &quot;forced awareness and advertising classes&quot;), which means I will be robbed and kidnapped and enslaved if I am caught smoking a blunt. This is oppressive and it is not a stretch to compare my oppressors in this scenario to Nazis, sure they are not quite on the same level of monstrosity but they are just a skip and a hop away. In the case of CP viewers the government is much closer to Nazi as CP viewers are often sentenced to prison where they are tortured, raped and sometimes killed. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">This just illustrates your single-minded blanket approach to everything you don&#039;t like.

God your inconsistency is truly pitiful and shows that you are completely unprincipled. But of course you can just make shit up to paint a picture however you like it, so that you can always be right, just like the Supreme Court did when they said viewing CP is not protected by the constitution. There is indeed systematic slaughter of drug users by the proponents of the war on drugs. Every time somebody overdoses on PMA mislabeled as MDMA it is a death attributable to the lack of regulation caused by the prohibition of drugs, and therefor it is equal to chemical warfare against drug users. Every time somebody gets infected with HIV because of outlawed needle exchanges, it is biological warfare against drug users. Not to mention the drug users and innocent bystanders who are raided by the paramilitary drug enforcement troops and shot to death with bullets. We are captured and sent to die in prisons, we are under chemical and biological attack and we are stormed by soldiers and shot at on a regular basis. They don&#039;t call it the WAR on drugs for no reason. But because we are so largely pacifists it is not a WAR on drugs rather it is a MASSACRE OF DRUG USERS AND INNOCENTS. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF US ARE BEING KILLED EVERY YEAR, IT IS FUCKING MASS EXECUTIONS, BY PROXY AND DIRECTLY. AND YOU WANT US TO WRITE LETTERS TO OUR ATTACKERS ASKING THEM TO STOP!

I&#039;m getting off track with this, aren&#039;t I... that&#039;s neither here nor there, never mind.<br /><br />What I&#039;m getting at is that this tolerance extends to those who would do us harm: they must be tolerated.&nbsp; This is *not* to say they must be allowed to do us harm or that we shouldn&#039;t defend ourselves, nor am I saying that we shouldn&#039;t -- if necessary -- forcibly restrict their freedoms so that they are unable to continue to hurt us.&nbsp; But that is all that should be done: prevention of future harm.&nbsp; Not visiting harm upon them in response.&nbsp; That just ends up with an extra person being harmed, and people who are harmed generally -- wait for it, wait for it now...! -- wish for revenge (i.e. to harm others).&nbsp; That&#039;s... pretty silly to knowingly continue doing, don&#039;t you think?<br /><br />Now getting to a point where the ones with the power would choose to restrict the right people and not the ones doing no harm... well, that&#039;s another matter entirely.&nbsp; Necessity is a bitch sometimes; if there&#039;s no other way, then there&#039;s no other way.&nbsp; But I don&#039;t think there&#039;s no other way.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think you do either though.&nbsp; You just don&#039;t think there&#039;s any *faster* way, is that correct?<br /><br />To jump straight to violence and revenge is to do the same exact thing that got us where we are: ignore logic and rationality in favor of our baser desires.&nbsp; Do you really not agree that society -- any human society -- will never be able to reach its most ideal state without a real commitment to logic and reason?&nbsp; More of one than just abandoning them when convenient for our own personal indulgences, I mean?<br /><br />I guess what I&#039;m asking is... do you not agree that your motivation is in part as reprehensible as those you seek to visit justice upon?&nbsp; I mean that&#039;s exactly what *they&#039;re* doing.&nbsp; I&#039;m curious and sincerely asking what your perspective is on -- well, on yourself, basically.

				kmfkewm, <br />I just don&#039;t have the time to spar with you anymore. By wishing death on people it is clear that you are a hateful person. You&#039;ve used about as much extremist vocabulary and ideology as you can to justify your campaign of deathful vengeance. This is exactly what evil zealot terrorists do. They are blinded by a simplistic black and white version of some kind of alternate reality whereby if only everyone else just agreed with them, all would be &#039;better&#039;, regardless of who must die to get there. <br /><br />There is no compromise for you, you will never be convinced of anything, only converted. And when you convert to something you will adhere to it&#039;s principles to the utmost extreme even if the end result is insanity. You are a smart and worthy debater. I&#039;m guessing that you&#039;re a young man in his 20&#039;s, mildly autistic and very impressionable however your views and opinions are strong and most likely will not change. <br /><br />I can only hope that when you mature you will choose to participate in the political system and fight for what you so strongly believe, in part&nbsp; because I do share some of your beliefs. (not the death to all LE part) and in part because I think you will find it far more personally rewarding when you see the results of your efforts and not the debris of your destruction. A more tragic outcome would have you join or start some kind of violent group of broken souls and unleash death upon those who you believe deserve it. <br /><br />For my part, I have lived in many countries worldwide and in 2 places in particular I have seen real jackboot thugs (you&#039;d almost be right in using your Nazi parallel) intimidate opposition and systematically murder &quot;enemies&quot;.&nbsp; The only justification needed to kill others was that they represented opposition to ideals. In Mexico police are killed when they don&#039;t let libertarian drug dealers traffic their dope freely. The drug barons say they have a right to produce what the market wants, the police say the law says otherwise. It&#039;s not about who is right and who is wrong, it&#039;s about how to balance competing interests. This balance is best done inside a political system of sorts, not by simply picking up a gun and going Rambo.<br />

				Yes we should totally organize the people who are not allowed to organize (because they are felons and cannot be in contact with each other) to get people who cannot vote (because they are felons) to vote for change. That sounds like a damn good plan. You see, this is why people like you are so dangerous. You are all for the rule of law, but once certain populations are legally prohibited from changing the laws then you are indistinguishable from a totalitarian. I think we should get laws passed saying that anybody who is a member of a church is banned from voting, we should make Bibles illegal and after people are arrested with a Bible they cannot vote because they are felons. As soon as this becomes law it is nice to know that there are brainwashed fucks like you who will support it, and start telling the Christians that the law is the law and that they should work within the political system that they are barred from being a part of to bring about change. After all, if they want to be a part of the political system they should stop going to church and reading the Bible, it isn&#039;t the governments fault that they are marginalized!
