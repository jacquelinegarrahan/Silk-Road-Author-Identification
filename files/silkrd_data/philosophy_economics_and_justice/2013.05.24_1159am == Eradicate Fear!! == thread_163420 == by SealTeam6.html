				I am a firm believer that fear is one of the biggest obstacles facing the human race.&nbsp; Fear keeps people locked up in their own minds, worrying about the present, the future, and even the past.&nbsp; Many turn to drugs to ease the pain of fear.&nbsp; This has a dangerous side effect of causing more fear in the individual.&nbsp; My entire life has been focused on defeating fear and bettering myself.&nbsp; I believe that if you can defeat fear every time it rears its ugly head, then you will enjoy great success in this life.&nbsp; I enjoy a higher quality of life due to this philosophy and I still aim to defeat fear in myself and others.&nbsp; My current lesson in how fear affects individuals constantly and daily is my name on this forum!&nbsp; The fear of seeing an avatar of four military men has shaken many people up!&nbsp; Anyone listening should take this as a lesson.&nbsp; Use your mind and think about what a Seal is, what there job description is, who they actually come after?&nbsp; Think about why I would name my account this.&nbsp; Just think.&nbsp; Ask questions.&nbsp; Then if you have some time, conquer a fear of your own today, and record the results, lemme know what happens!

				A world without fear would be a world without Seals. Fear is the root of many issues, but the root of all issues is not singular. The brain works in a much more complex and interdependent manner than we commonly understand. There is fear, desire, belief, suffering, uncertainty, reward/punishment, retribution, compassion, and so on and so on. All of these things are manifested biologically and expressed by interdependent operations of the systems and territories of the brain. There is inter-regional communication going on in our brains –chemically, electrically, informationally– and out of these communications arise thoughts, emotions, voluntary and involuntary decisions, involuntary/voluntary actions. Our personalities operate as the direction of thoughts and emotions, but not the creation of it. These will come to us whether we want them or not, and we ultimately have zero control over the exact shape of our next thought.<br /><br />In summary, there are myriad issues at the root of suffering. I posit that we must &quot;simply&quot; orient our awareness toward truth through the scientific, reasonable direction of our attention. Not only must we learn how to point ourselves toward truth, we must continually learn how to reliably identify it.

				I suppose fear can be useful in a very basic run-the-fuck-away-from-that-tiger kind of way, but it is also as stated a very complex psychological obstacle. Practicing the act of facing fear is useful and necessary. We may have to accept fear, what we must learn is not to fear the fear, and run from the obstacle.<br />&quot;I must not fear. Fear is the Mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.&quot;<br />True dat.

				I don&#039;t think we have to accept fear, I really think we need to defeat it as much as possible.&nbsp; I should not have just put eradicate fear as the title, it&#039;s more about eradicating useless fear.&nbsp; Imagine a world where there was no fear.&nbsp; What kind of world would that be?&nbsp; A paradise, or the wild wild west?&nbsp;

				This has been a bit tricky for me, to answer this question, because fear has been a useful tool for me in my early years, by keeping me from doing some very stupid and more likely deadly situations. It has also motivated me to push myself both physically and mentally further than I ever thought possible. So it is hard to imagine the eradication of fear. It would seem, in some cases, that fear can actually be a good thing for those people that are able to channel that into a constructive driving force for betterment of self or others. :)<br /><br />I do understand that it can also be a paralyzing emotion that causes some to be destroyed by it. This seems to be my life now. So maybe this has been the reason for my behavior these past many years. Perhaps, the fear has become so over whelming that I have fallen for the destructive self abusing way of chemical abuse.&nbsp; :o <br /><br />Or, I just like them and don&#039;t want to give them up.&nbsp; IDK IJS&nbsp; ;)

				I tend to equate pain and fear, and lump them all into suffering. I refer to psychic pain, and non-physical fear. I&#039;ve always had a mantra that goes something like, &quot;I&#039;ll be successful to the extent that I am willing to experience suffering.&quot; I recently became a nurse (as a third career, later in my life). <br /><br />My success in this endeavor was in direct proportion to my ability to stand the suffering of the process--the 20 hour days of classes and studying, the traumatizing clinical rotations, the quick action needed in emergent situations, the smells, fluids, blood, invasive procedures, death, the heartbreak. <br /><br />At any point in time I could have quit, just walked out. Many mornings I would be on my way to clinical and I say, &quot;I can turn around at anytime and just quit.&quot; That permission allowed me the strength to continue for the next few minutes, which turned into hour, then days, then finally graduation!<br /><br />In all of this, I was never free of fear or &quot;pain&quot; I just carried on in spite of it.

				I find that people tend to fear that which that have no knowledge of or they don&#039;t fully understand. Ultimately we decide what we are afraid of and our perception of events controls our reality. We have the ability to alter our perception at anytime however most people are so consumed by dogma and fear that they fail to realize this.
