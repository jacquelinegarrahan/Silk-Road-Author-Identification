				Just curious to see if any other Australians have given this topic some contemplation. All indications suggest that next Saturday a conservation government will be put into power. Not that Labor can be considered &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;left-wing&quot;, they are centre-left and the Liberals (despite their name) are centre-right - so there probably won&#039;t be a whole lot of difference following Saturday&#039;s election. <br /><br />What we are curious to know is which Australian political party do Silkroad users feel best reflect their interests policy wise?

				They are both don&#039;t care for personal freedom and run with popular opinion. Even though the Greens are more &quot;liberal&quot; in their drug policies, they are statists and don&#039;t really believe in personal freedom.<br />There is no party (that I am aware) that has a government out of the way approach where personal liberty is championed.<br />None of the above!<br />

				We agree that the two major parties (three including the greens) are much of a muchness. However there are quite a few &quot;fringe&quot; political groups that are quite distinct from the ALP, LNP and Greens. The Drug Law And Reform Australia Party comes to mind as one example. Our team at Natural Highs are quite politically motivated, we want Australians to vote for what is in their interests, not just for what they think is in their interests.<br /><br />Though it will obviously come down to either the LNP or the ALP (most likely the LNP) - out of those two, we would prefer the ALP, their NBN is so much better, Australians (and Silkroad users) would benefit so much from having faster internet.

				Flee the country. That&#039;s our only hope!<br />The choices we have are comparable to gong shopping at the end of the day and buying a loaf of bread. <br />The only loaves of bread left are squished, shitty and nobody wants them. Best off going to another shop.

				Not too many other free states to flee to....<br />We want freedom, not handouts of our own money to buy votes for career politicians.

				No difference as long as it remains the two party preferred as it has always been. Time to start our own independent sovereign state.
