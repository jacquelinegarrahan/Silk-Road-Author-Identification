				So i was busted at Gnarnia festival in august with some paper.&nbsp; We have had this paper all summer long and knowing the source I wonder what the chemical really is.&nbsp; I am almost certain it was not real LSD.&nbsp; He even told me that it was not L, but that it was ALD-52.&nbsp; But I even question that.<br /><br />Now correct me if i&#039;m wrong but do you not need to make LSD before you can make ALD?? If that&#039;s true who would take the time and effort to make perfectly good L and make it into ALD.<br /><br />Now on to my real question.&nbsp; They are trying to charge me with trafficking LSD, when it was tested with the 3 stage DEA test kit it turned up purple, which signals that it is L but it had a bitter ass taste, it took a few hits to get a desired trip but it was a really mellow happy trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;Even more confusing to me is the paper wasn&#039;t white, it was blotter and on the back side of the art work the paper was purple.&nbsp; The same purple that L test kits show when it is real L.&nbsp; So I have been thinking that maybe who ever layed the paper layed it with some kind of chemical that would cause the paper to come back as L on a three stage kit even though it is not.&nbsp; Also would ALD come back as LSD on the 3 stage kits? Or could it possibly have been a RC with a chemical added to help pass the 3 stage kit?<br /><br />Any one traveling this summer to festivals (within) the US and what not had any experience with this paper.&nbsp;

				First of all, really sorry to hear about your situation and hope you can beat the case.<br /><br />The ALD-52 story doesn&#039;t sound very plausible to us, either.&nbsp; Nick Sand &amp; Co. did make that way back in the day to try to circumvent the early anti-Acid laws, but it didn&#039;t even work for them as a defense, so why would anybody go to the trouble of synthesizing it now?<br /><br />Seems like your best hope is to get it independently tested via GC-MS so there&#039;s no doubt about what it is.&nbsp; Have you talked with your lawyer about how to make that happen?&nbsp; And if it&#039;s a non-scheduled RC, then it would seem you&#039;d be in a much better position, as long as they don&#039;t have any evidence that you were representing it as LSD for sale.&nbsp; This might be the first time we&#039;d be pulling for somebody to not have Acid on their blotters ;).<br /><br />Good luck.

				Really bitter?<br />Couple doses to come up?<br />Doesn&#039;t exactly feel like LSD?<br /><br /><br />A lot of the European &quot;Shiva blotters going around were actually chroma-tested and were found to be LSM or Lysergic Acid Morpholide.&nbsp; It has an extremely AND thoroughly bitter taste.&nbsp; Many early vendors claimed that it was due to the &quot;fixation spray.&nbsp; A guy on OVDB thread chroma-ed some of his tabs fitting your description and found them to be LSM.&nbsp; &nbsp;Lysergic Acid Morpholide is NOT a controlled substance in the USA.&nbsp; Also, the precursors required aren&#039;t even within Sched II boundries.&nbsp; &nbsp;You should be safe.<br /><br />Let us know how it plays out, <br />best of luck.<br /><br />Good vibes bro<br />jtemp

Tested them myself.<br /><br />If it was these tabs (drawing of shiva in yellow / green on front / linedrawn shiva on back) I am afraid you are out of luck. It is almost certainly LSD.<br /><br />Lots of discussion on it several times in the Avenegrs LSD review thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=45270.2265

				You&#039;re shit out of luck either way. It was on paper, so it doesn&#039;t matter if it&#039;s ald-52 or 25i or DOC or anything else, you will still be convicted for selling LSD.
