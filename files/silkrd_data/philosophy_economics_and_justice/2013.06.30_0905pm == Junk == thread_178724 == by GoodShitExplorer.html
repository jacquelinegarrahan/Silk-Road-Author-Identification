				Haha i want to sub for this.<br /><br />I think i am finding out that reality is heavily paved by our intention. I havent done drugs in a long time (not counting weed), but i have had a quest for knowledge about spirituality and time for some time now. I still dont know much about meditation, and what it is honestly, but i have integrated small steps in my life, and i recognize that everything is life, and i must do good things in life, good karma. I am obsessed with things specifically like ascesion, and astral projection, and ego death. I dont know if this things are myth&#039;s or are true. But then i think maybe that isn&#039;t the answer to life. I&#039;m still confused about this part... But like i said, whenever i try to meditate and clear my mind of thoughts i think about all this. So i try to just do good karma&#039;s. Be happy in life. In this long break i achieved a lot of academic success, and also i think i have lowered my expectation&#039;s, my family&#039;s expectations (not in a bad way i hope). I also changed alot of my stricter belief&#039;s, im a hindu brahmin, did not used to eat meat, etc. Also became atheist for some time. Now i believe in god as a life force through EVERYTHING. Sorry, i dunno where ive gone from where, haha.<br /><br />Anyway, to sum up i would say reality is what you make of it, what you intend it, what you perceive it as, everyone&#039;s is different. But i yet have to find out the full understanding of that statement i feel. Take care brothers

				As far as we know, all this *could* just be an illusion. I certainly think so sometimes. Sure, there&#039;s scientific data to back up the current view of the world around us, but it still doesn&#039;t doesn&#039;t explain everything. <br /><br />Take dreams for example. I&#039;ve had some very thought provoking ones, to say the least. I&#039;ve seen the future in dreams for sure (as it relates to my life and experiences). How the fuck does that work? Science has yet to explain that one. So it makes me wonder.<br /><br />There&#039;s just so much we don&#039;t know or understand.<br /><br />At one point, people used to think the world was flat. We also used to think the sun revolved around the earth. For the people alive back then, that was their reality. And its turns out those beliefs were just illusions. So it really woudn&#039;t suprise me and anything we currenly believe turns out to be an illusion as well.

				Humans clearly don&#039;t view reality as it &quot;really&quot; is. We are limited by our own perception. Quantum and string theory shows that we obviously have no fucking clue about the actual nature and fabric of the universe. I recommend the novel Flatland by Edwin Abbot for an interesting perspective on what real is.

The entire human infrastructure is modeled on our own body. Speakers just like ears etc. <br />&nbsp;Our senses only pick up such a fraction of the universe. The amount of waves in the light spectrum is just mind boggling and we only perceive such a small sliver of it. I look at it the same way as time really. Everything exists all at once but we just feel as though we&#039;re flowing through &quot;time&quot;. If you think about the position of celestial bodies in the universe, it&#039;s all pretty much frozen in a grander cosmological scale. Considering a human lifetime isn&#039;t even a second in the universal scale. I figure the natural universe is just a massive hive of activity and materials whizzing around all at once. Even the void between celestial bodies is clearly filled with something. I&#039;m pretty glad we&#039;re only able to see our little corner of the universe anyway. It&#039;s so much simpler just being a nice content monkey right? Seeing reality as it really is would be quite frightening I think. We&#039;ll never know anyway.
