				I haven&#039;t (fortunately) seen much violence/ sketchiness associated around drugs. That said I have seen absolutely none when it comes to psychedelics. Which is kind of odd, but also understandable in ways. I mean psychs by there very nature I guess can make people less violent. I mean the whole &quot;peace loving, hippie stereotype&quot; must come from somewhere right. The majority of them aren&#039;t addictive and I doubt you could really cut them in the same way you could cut heroin or coke. That said it still baffles me a little. Surely as you go higher up though there must be an increased risk of getting robbed etc. I mean speaking strictly from a financial perspective. The more money involved the more someone might be tempted to rip someone off or hurt them even if it is psychs in play. Do pyschs just attract a different less violent crowd to &quot;traditional harder&quot; drugs. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong I&#039;m not saying it&#039;d be anywhere close to the shit going on in mexico with people getting beheaded over trafficking routes and shit. But I just can&#039;t believe that it&#039;s all happy go lucky. All my experience points to the opposite though. I remember back when I first started buying drugs (On the &quot;streets&quot;) I got robbed for a gram of cocaine by someone who was supposedly a friend. The ironic thing is that like 6 months or so later me and a couple of friends all chipped in for some 2CB from a relatively unknown source. The price of it all came to be about just over double the amount the coke was bought for. Yet we had no worries buying it and the dude we bought it from was completely different to the &quot;friend&quot; I&#039;d bought the coke from.<br /><br />What do you guys think?<br />Is it just that different drugs attract different people. Are the people who are more likely to be associated with violence and crime in drugs be attracted to the fast turnaround that drugs like coke and meth provide.<br /><br />This is even evident on SR. Just compare the ratings of vendors who sell shrooms, DMT, LSD with those who sell Coke and Heroin. Admittedly you will probably have VERY different types of customers for each and that no doubt plays a part in why vendors of harder drugs may have lower feedback scores. Maybe that in itself is why there is more sketchiness associated with hard drugs because the customers are more likely to be abusers rather than users.<br /><br />Anyway it was just something I was wondering. All of the above only comes from my own limited experience as a small time buyer of drugs so I don&#039;t mean to offend anyone or anything.

				psychedelics spawn from a completely different environment and mindset than drugs like heroin or coke..&nbsp; &nbsp;not to mention being addicted to &#039;dangerous&#039; drugs open a whole different worldview of bad spirits and tattered emotion. <br /><br />psychedelics promote community, most that other shit will break apart a community.&nbsp; &nbsp; like all things in life, there are positive poles and negative poles, drugs don&#039;t escape those natural laws.&nbsp;

				I think to assume that one drug or drug type has a set of either non violent or violent people arround it is not wise. Just remember though as criminals we do not have lawyers to sue people and police to call if we get ripped off. Apart from our word we have violence as a way of dealing with problems. Its sad but unless drugs are legal it will be like this. However...<br /><br />It completely depends on the area and the people...for example i have seen people (Israelis) at parties and teknivals across Europe ripping people off and hurting people...these were the ones selling the Psychadelics. Ive also seen people loved up and giving away all the MDMA and Acid they were supposed to sell!<br /><br />Ive seen people robbed for weed, ive had weapons used against me in drug deals in the UK for what i would consider a small amount of weed (250g). Ive also seen the beautiful people sat around growing, smoking and selling their pot for the love of it.<br /><br />Even going as far as the likes of heroin...dirty grotty council estates, seeing my friends killed, stabbed, shot...then theres the Iranians and others who sit around sharing stories as they smoke heroin after work! <br /><br />Its swings and roundabouts. Just maybe things like Silk Road help drugs move further away from violence, however they then move into the realms of cyber attacks.<br /><br />Ive been robbed, multiple times. once for 10k. but never to my face successfully. always when im away and not around have they won.

				Drug social circles can evolve in strange and disturbing ways, money, women, and legal issues can all wreak havoc upon even the tightest of circles. Usually , for most people, violence is a last resort option for when they or loved ones are in danger .....or perceived danger ( cough *up to many nights **cough).<br />You&#039;ll get dealers who have masculinity issues, Napoleon issues, stupidity issues, who take personal offense in what should be clearly business, when things go wrong. And things will go wrong at some point.Ya, those types will just nut up out of the blue because you &quot;disrespect&quot; them- Ya if you run across&nbsp; those types that associate drugs= power=$=masculinity its a good sign to stay clear from them ASAP.<br />Otherwise you would have to have done some shady ass shit to deserve a hurting otherwise- that should be on you though - you should&#039;ve knew the job was dangerous when you took it, *bock bock bock*.<br /><br />Dont snitch boys n girls. Man up&nbsp; to your crime and be prepared to go to jail if you use drugs, it just comes with the life decisions you&#039;ve made. It never ends&nbsp; happily when you snitch your friends off-

				I have had tons of lucrative offers to make meth for people and even large cartels. Every time I turn it down. No fucking way. I prefer psychedelics because there are ZERO issues whatsoever except for the law. The only issues I have had with psychedelics is when I tried to expand to untapped markets (the blacks) and that is when I endured every problem you can think of in the drug trade. Now that I&#039;m back to messing with just clubbers and college kids and rich whites I have ZERO problems.&nbsp; The business of drugs of love instead of drugs of despair tend to go smoothly.

				People with nitrous tanks often hang out around the psychedelic crowd and are notoriously violent. I&#039;ve heard of people getting shot over a balloon. <br /><br />Also people with PCP are not necessarily part of the psychedelic crowd but can become violent...<br /><br />Like anything, once it becomes about the money, there are always some people who will take the short term money (robbery/violence) over the long term money of building a reliable network.

				In San Francisco&#039;s Golden Gate Park there are fights over turf to sell LSD and weed by street hippy types.<br /><br />Also supposedly Leonard Pickard (LSD chemist) was going to kill an informant.<br /><br />Besides that theres not a lot of violence associated with psychedelics. One more reason they are awesome.<br />But yeah I guess any time there is a lot of money involved people can get jealous.
