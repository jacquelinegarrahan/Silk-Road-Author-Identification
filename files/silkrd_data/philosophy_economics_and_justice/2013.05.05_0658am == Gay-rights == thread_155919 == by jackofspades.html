				I didn&#039;t used to be a big believer one way or the other but ever since i got into drugs (a few years back) I realized that the government is just trying to control another group of human beings (gays in this case) just like they were controlling drug-users. And even worse, it&#039;s always for their own potential benefit. I am a big supporter of gay rights, and proud of it!<br /><br />Please do not use The Bible as a reason for anti-gay rights if you are opposed, I&#039;m curious as to why someone would oppose but please don&#039;t say the &#039;B&#039; word.<br /><br />I know that a lot of us here on the forums think and act similarly most of us seem to be libertarians at heart and we all have good ideas and great discussions. So i was wondering what you guys think. In favor, opposed or indifferent...<br /><br />

				My position involves the idea that the state has no actual authority to &quot;marry&quot; anyone. Marriage is a holy sacrament in many religions, and last time I checked the state isn&#039;t a priest/rabbi. Especially in the United States, where there is supposed to be a separation of &quot;church and state,&quot; and when they use the word &quot;marriage&quot; on any sort of tax or document, it isn&#039;t right. Now, when it comes to gays, according to my religion (yes there are religious people on SR, believe it or not) homosexuality is an abomination. However, I&#039;m not opposed to allowing homosexuals to get married in their own church or place of worship. The state/government/country needs to rewrite the tax laws/stop issuing &quot;marriage licenses.&quot; I find it absurd how the government can marry anyone at all.<br /><br />Just something to think about.

				Personally...I do not understand this whole legalization thing. <br /><br />Was it illegal before? Or was it just not an option on the paperwork? Why should things be by default illegal in the first place, shouldn&#039;t things start out legal? Starting with things illegal and then having to legalize them just doesn&#039;t make sense. If there is no law against it, why would you not be able to do it? Also, what gives someone the right to impose their religious beliefs on someone else? This shouldn&#039;t even be a debate, just like abortion. I&#039;m fairly sure that personal beliefs are a First Amendment right...<br /><br />I think I&#039;m just unable to comprehend the intricacies and useless convolutions of a bureaucracy.

				Gay marriage has two main negative externalities: (1) on children, and (2) on the cultural institution of marriage.<br /><br />Both of these can be empirically evaluated; neither necessarily undercuts the State endorsement of same-sex marriage.<br /><br />Ronald Bailey, both as a libertarian and as a columnist for the libertarian magazine Reason, recently wrote (http://reason.com/archives/2013/04/05/the-science-on-same-sex-marriage) that, &quot;A 2004 study of registered partnerships in Sweden reported that gay male couples were 50 percent more likely to divorce than were heterosexual couples. Lesbian couples were nearly three times more likely to divorce than were heterosexual couples.&quot; Although I have not reproduced evidence, it is (I hope) common knowledge that children from divorced parents have dramatically poorer life outcomes (e.g., more likely to commit crime, not attend college, etc.). Accompanying the rise of same-sex marriage would be the rise of same-sex parenting, with the attendant consequence of predictably-disproportionate divorce rates (ceteris paribus). This is a negative externality, imposed upon children (and thereafter the community-at-large). Moreover, if we want a society that possesses the cultural habits needed to sustain peace and free markets&nbsp; (e.g., SR), then such a commercial society likely necessitates strong, family-focused households.<br /><br />Likewise, Dan Savage (a well-known homosexual and columnist) has advocated (https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/magazine/infidelity-will-keep-us-together.html?pagewanted=all) a &quot;more flexible attitude&quot; about marriage (as have others, like Andrew Sullivan), loosening the constraints of monogamous fidelity. To legitimize same-sex marriage and to then begin legitimizing nonmonogamous marriages can be problematic. Such arrangements are more likely to fail yet more likely to tempt experimentation by onlookers.<br /><br />Perhaps these considerations are insufficient or can be rebutted by countervailing evidence, but the debate is not a mirage: same-sex marriage can have real effects, both on the spouses and others.

				I really think everybody on Silk Road should support gay rights.<br />Everyone is on Silk Road because they want drugs. Drugs are something which the governments has told us NO, you cannot have that. We still want them. It is harming nobody, except potentially ourselves using the drugs. Why should the Government decide what I do, if it doesn&#039;t even harm anyone? Same with gay people. It has no impact on anyone elses lives. Why should they be denied the right to marry? It harms NOBODY. Why would I care if 2 gay men got married? It affects me in no way at all. But it makes 2 people happy and that is what is important.<br /><br />Same with Silk Road. It is fantastic that we have access to such a range of high-quality drugs that are delivered to us safely and securely to our own homes.<br />It harms nobody. Why should it be illegal? It is just the Government taking freedom away from us.

But its not totally true - there are a lot of mundane assholes who are gay, take my word for it, haha. They just don&#039;t get out as much or shout as loud.<br /><br />Anyway, in reply to the original subject, yes of course gay people deserve the same rights. Theres a lot of yawning going on in this thread, and I think thats because the majority of people using this forum are all from the US, EU, UK, etc. Even Australia is joining the queer club all of a sudden.<br /><br />But it has to be pointed out that there are still some places in the world where gay people are not just fighting for their rights, but fighting for their lives. So before we get all uppity about gay rights, and marriage, and how uneventful it is that gay people now have the same rights... remember that it ain&#039;t the case everywhere. If you&#039;re even sat here on SR in the first place, gay or not, you&#039;re probably lucky to be living in the society you do.

				personally, i get tired of hearing about all this gayness. there is some weird illuminati plot to turn the physicality of man and woman androgynous with chemicals.<br /><br />i could never find myself in a gay relationship..&nbsp; i make a facial expression in the form of disgust when i see gayness; not to offend, but the act of being gay naturally repels my interest.&nbsp; With that said, i can certainly be friends and be cool with a gay person, that lifestyle does not offend me, even though i think it&#039;s pretty vulgar in it&#039;s act..&nbsp; i&#039;m sure i would rather have the company of a cool gay person as opposed to some layman american bro.. a gay person should have the same rights as me; they don&#039;t have my complete respect -but they don&#039;t need it.&nbsp; I give them no disrespect either. <br /><br />gay rights mostly boil down to marriage and benefits... man man, man woman -imo the sanctity of legal certificate marriage is a bullshit trap anyways.&nbsp; All must realize, anything that has something to do with a LICENSE is just another way for them to control you.

				Considering that the fast majority of gay man have no sex with their partner and just to seem get better along with a male rather then a female as a&nbsp; companion for live to grow old with, I think it should be possible to give those people the same rights as strait people.<br /><br />&nbsp;When it comes to essential laws, the gay community should be treated the same way as other strait people are treated.<br />&nbsp;When someone dies there is to much difference in rights right now. <br /><br />Your partner for live has the same rights as your neighbor without a marriage, as your kids who can never be famaly and own nothing from second daddy if he dies<br /><br />&nbsp;No pension richts when the breadwinner dies. Lot&#039;s of trouble that can be wiped away with marriage and the rights that&#039;s comes along with that legal status.<br /><br />It is private what 2 people do whether they are strait or gay, if they do drugs or sex, but I know most gay man dislike anal sex and they kiss less other man then a average Arabic male does.<br /><br />Gay pride parades are and will be privileges of big city&#039;s like San Francisco or Amsterdam.<br /><br />Normal gay men find those parades over the top like most strait people.<br /><br />And it&#039;s a letter or three in a book of law. O.K.maybe 3 phrases. No one cares if gay married&nbsp; people don&#039;t eat at the same table and dont sleep in the same bed.<br /><br />&nbsp;You have to have permission from a judge according the law when you are married<br /><br />That&#039;s not the reason gay people want to marry.<br /><br />You can eat and sleep together if you want to in most normal country&#039;s, you do not have to be married.<br /><br />But if you are married you should eat at the same table and share the same bed.<br /><br />That picture frightens people.<br />They think it might have a contagious effect on the youth and so on.<br /><br />Everywhere around the world no body&#039;s notice the difference weather gay merriage is allowed or when not.<br /><br />The sun shines the same way and dogs still bark.<br /><br />And you will still have to work, so nothings changes for the rest of the community.<br /><br />It is only fair to the gay community.<br /><br />As long other people are not effected by gay marriage they should not care.<br /><br />When strait people think of 2 gay people in 1 bed they can&#039;t help thinking and picturing those gay people having sex.<br /><br />More often then not is that not the case.<br /><br />It tells nothing over and about those gay people but a whole lot more with the dirty mind.<br /><br />Protesters against gay marriage protest against two people of the same sex having sex.<br />But that has nothing to do with marriage.<br /><br />It will be done anyway, weather gay marriage is allowed or not.<br /><br />By allowing gay marriage there are not going to be more gay people.<br />To be gay is not as having a contagious sickness from which others become ill or end up gay too.<br /><br />Nothing will change for straait people not for better and not for worse, but gay people have a world to win and it is a pity they have to fight for those same rights we strait people find normal. It should not be a privilege for strait people to have the legal status of being married.

				don&#039;t really give a shit about gay marriage tbh it&#039;s the attitude from certain members of society i&#039;d like to see fade out. i&#039;d prefer to be able to walk down a street just holding hands with a girl without people staring or shouting dykes or creepy guys pestering for a threesome than have some wacky wedding. it&#039;d be nice if the countries which torture, imprison or kill gay people would stop doing that though. at least we&#039;re not contributing to the ridiculous overpopulation of the planet in such an OOPS kinda way.

				I misunderstood the thread topic:<br /><br />Gay Rights, as in what rights are gay... that suck, or whatever, like allowing women to drive.... That&#039;s a gay right: women drivers.<br /><br />Gay Rights... ha ha... Will gay marriage help reduce AIDS in gay men?<br /><br />Gay Rights... Hmmm... most of the people I&#039;ve met in show business or marketing/advertisement were very, very gay.

				Well you most have strong arguments. And if you do not is better not to pick a fight you cannot win. But if you believe you have strong enough arguments then by all means. A rule form the Art of War is to know when to fight and know when to to fight. And fight only the battles you can win.<br /><br />You should replace to word with with debate.<br /><br />But this is tread is not about the art of war. But about gay-rights.

				I am of course for gay rights.&nbsp; I think that phrase usually refers to marriage and ending discrimination in the work place.&nbsp; What we see on tv when the topic of gay rights is usually two good looking white men kissing and getting married.&nbsp; Many people see marriage as something reserved for more privileged people and not of pressing concern to non-hetero normal equality issues.&nbsp; In fact, some, including myself, would say that the long, drawn out issue of gay marriage and other similar issues serves to distract the masses from the most important issues of oppression facing the queer community.&nbsp; People who do not conform to modern society&#039;s definition of &quot;normal&quot; in the areas of sexuality and gender designation are oppressed in a number of ways.&nbsp; Isolation and overt discrimination lead to an increased likelihood of poverty, which brings with it a brutal life.&nbsp; I encourage people to not only accept people who decide to enter in personal relationships with people who identify as the same gender as them but to accept all people and their choices of who to enter into consenting relationships with regardless of how society classifies them.&nbsp; Next time you find yourself in a conversation about gay marriage please think about bringing such issues as trans people being forced to live in prison populations that they do not share a self identified gender designation as.&nbsp; Those people are often targeted for rape and other brutalities by inmates and guards.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is a much more pressing issue than two guys getting married in the hamptons and returning to their hedge fund jobs.&nbsp; It&#039;s always class, and non hetero normal people are far more likely to end up in ostracized classes than hetero-normal individuals.

				There is no need to advocate for being gay, black, jew, women, witch etc. You don&#039;t need that, this is not the problem. We need to understand why there are groups of people (minorities) who are scapegoated. <br /><br />In a modern society everything is in a constant change, what was right thing to do yesterday is wrong today and is going to be punishable tomorrow. Since the rapid urbanization began (around 16th century) there have always been some sort of witch trials going on, it is because people don&#039;t accept fast change as a part of the way life is evolving. There must be somebody somewhere who is responsible for the unwanted change, finding a common enemy helps to strengthen in-group relationships. <br /><br />It&#039;s all driven by FEAR, if you want to know why certain groups are hated just ask what are the reasons/traits they are hated for. In case of homosexuality main things people attribute to them are - they are non-reproductive, hedonistic, gender role-defying, spreading diseases. People who hate homosexuals attribute themselves the opposite characteristics. So it&#039;s not really about the homosexuals or whomever, if we want to make the change we need to address the fears of the haters and let them become aware and help them construct their identities on positive programs.

				Don&#039;t like gay marriage? Then don&#039;t get one. It&#039;s that easy. I think its absurd that gay marriage is such a divisive issue. People are so willing to divide and group each other when in reality we are all pretty much the same on a biological level.
