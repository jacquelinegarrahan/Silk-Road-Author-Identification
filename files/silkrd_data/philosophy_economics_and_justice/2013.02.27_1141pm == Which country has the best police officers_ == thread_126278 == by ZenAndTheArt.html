				Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not pro-LE or anything. But when it comes to being a criminal, which countries police force would you rather be up against?<br /><br />Which country are you LEAST likely to get shot, entrapped, beat-up, &#039;fitted-up&#039; for a crime you didn&#039;t commit or generally treated like shit by the average police officer?<br /><br />America seems to have some of the worst police in the western world, they come across to be on average very stupid, aggressive, intolerant and violent, and dangerous mix of personality traits for anyone who carries a gun!&nbsp;

				&quot;Best&quot; lists usually has me pointing to Scandinavian countries, but not for LE (I mean, they&#039;re not even the same species as American cops, but still).<br /><br />I cast my vote for New Zealand. LE with a *sense of humour*. It&#039;s like they haven&#039;t been brainwashed to fear and hate citizens, or something.

				England for me, they don&#039;t carry guns. I mean if I get pulled over with 5lbs of hashish I am going to flex the heat (.44) (AR15) their way and watch them kick rocks, and hope swat doesn&#039;t arrive in time.

				Best police officers is an oxymoron. Like a tall midget, or a brave frenchmen. Theoretically it sounds even cool to some extent, but in reality it&#039;s contradictory at best and retarded at worst.

				Well here in Kenya I think we have the best cops as long as you have money. Also Drugs are cheap, Ive thought of dealing heroin out of kenya because its only about $3 a gram on the inside of kenya, but then again, i have a witness seen people lined on the side of the road while a cop puts a bullet in there head. Corruption is very very very high here in East Africa, and i only tell you here because i am anonymous. Oh i know the American will read this thinking he can come to kenya and get cheap drug... don&#039;t&nbsp; try for it americano gangster, the slums will consume you.&nbsp;

I always known that we have CCTV on every street corner in our town centers, but it not a major problem in residential areas. I&#039;ve never felt that I live under constant surveillance. It was only when I came on here that I&#039;ve heard so many people talk about the UK as a CCTV state, mainly by foreigners as well!<br /><br />On another point, I can understand the hatred a lot of you feel towards LE (especially our American cousins). I too felt something similar when I was a teenager. But I don&#039;t think you can really justify murdering them with any seriousness. I had a close friend murdered for no reason and I wouldn&#039;t wish that on anyone. Also it&#039;s easy to call for dead police when sat behind a keyboard, I doubt anyone here has the capability or motivation to actually kill anyone (and if you do then you really do need professional help).

				I would say whatever state protects human rights and you actually have the chance to have an independent complaint review. Not something that we are quite there with in the UK on the complaint review, it isn&#039;t truly independent.<br /><br />No police force is perfect not even model ones like the Scandinavians, because there are people involved, you can find right bastards in the Swedish police, as you probably can find nice American cops.<br /><br />It&#039;s not about the police force, it about how the state uses them and how accountable society makes them for their actions when they do wrong.<br /><br />The UK was no better than some less developed (from Western moralistic viewpoint) states when it failed to bring the killers of Jean Charles de Menezes to justice. But it is better than most, not as perfect as some.<br /><br />When I need my rights to be protected, I will still take the UK, Netherlands, and Nordics over others. <br /><br />Police are there to up hold the law, and work for society. Despite the issues in the UK, policing by consent means that if you are polite to them they have to be polite to you. <br /><br />Know your proper rights,&nbsp; don&#039;t be an arsehole when you apply your rights to the police, always talk to a lawyer first.<br /><br />Oh and know what they are allowed to do as well. I love all this cocky bullshit that people come out with, the police can&#039;t do that to me. Well they can, and they will know the law that allows them to handcuff you, arrest you and detain you better than you.&nbsp; But I guess that is also a indicator of a good police force, when they know when they are operating within the law and are professional about it. As anything less would mean it is their jobs and career over if they get caught operating outside of it. <br /><br />How ever bad you think prison is, it is worse if you are ex police and sent down.<br />

				@ Flyinghigh1660 - Good post (+1karma). You raise some thought provoking points (It&#039;s not about the police force, it about how the state uses them and how accountable society makes them for their actions when they do wrong. - for example). :)

				The UK police are generally ok if dealt with properly (dont get me wrong stay silent in an interview) but the best police force I have come across is the Dutch, I was pulled over for speeding and dealt with very fairly, they were educated and spoke perfect English, fined me 200 euros for doubling their speed limit and let me on my way. At no point did I feel bullied or scared which I found professional.I felt that they were actually interested in a safer country rather than an arrest. ( the only time I have ever come across this)

				In my personal experience with police in Canada the arguably necessary role they play in society is vastly overshadowed by their vindictive tendency to abuse their power and the fact that I have never seen them help in any situation ever, only create horrible situations for no good reason at all. I could never stomach killing a person, or even an animal for that matter, but I could stab a police officer to death and go eat an ice cream sundae in the same afternoon. Assuming there were hypothetically no consequences that is, as after all they have power over me. I fucking hate them so much. If any of you are reading this right now, FUCK OFF!

Not only because they have 50 mechagodzillas at their disposal but because they have the nicest police officers I have ever met, I was caught with few grams of cocaine and they didn&#039;t do anything as long as it was for personal use (from my understanding). Of course I can guarantee it depends on the officer you meet, no matter what country. But I&#039;m just speaking from my personal experience. I haven&#039;t had many run ins with the police. The worst of the bunch have to be the L.A.P.D.

The question I&#039;m trying to ask is more like; Which is the least bad police force? If that makes any sense grammatically. I could have asked; Which is the worst police force? But I think we already have a good idea who they&#039;d be, and that would also be the long way round to finding the answer I&#039;m after. Also, I tend to have a &quot;glass half full&quot; outlook in general.<br /><br />The best Orc? Orcs are cool, no? A top contender for best Orc would have to be either Fighting Uruk-Hai leader Lurtz, or the &#039;White Orc&#039; Azog from the Hobbit movie. (On a side note, did anyone see the 48 frames per second (fps) version of The Hobbit? I found it very strange at first and it took me a good half an hour to &#039;get used&#039; to it. But I do think that if we keep an open mind about it, and give it a fair chance, then we may eventually come to appreciate it&#039;s uses. And it&#039;ll become another colour in the film makers&#039; palette, that can be called upon when artistically useful to a project. I thought it worked at it&#039;s best when there was lots of fast and busy action happening on-screen.)

				Ukraine in my opinion. If you&#039;ve been there, you know what I&#039;m talking about. They stop violent crime, but dont pull people over for speeding or doing drugs or any other victimless crimes. I mean, just the ones I&#039;ve run into while I was there.

				I have two countries in mind:<br />1. Greenland - they have 2 cities and theyefore (probably) the least need for pigs (I mean cops, sorry I meant to say that!)<br /><br />2. Antartica - yeah, they;re not a country, so they have no pigs!<br /><br />

				Best: Sweden, Holland, UK<br />Well balanced powers which reconcile the rights of citizens with the power needed to solve crime.<br /><br />Worst: USA, South Africa, Brazil<br />Too much power, scary and a complete lack of accountability.
