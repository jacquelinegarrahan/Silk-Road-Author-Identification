				Wherever you are in the world there are probably at least some things in your legal or social systems that you would rather have changed (I mean, you&#039;re on SR for one thing). But what kind of social structure do you think really would be the most ideal for your nation/area or indeed humans as a whole? <br /><br />I think the communications and imformations networks established now have essentially ruled out any possibility of return to nomadic tribal groups or anything like that, and it has connected the people of all nations like has never before been possible on Earth. Is a governing body required or indeed even plausible at this level of population? Are people better off in a thriving urban/industrial setting or is a rural lifestyle more beneficial? What about an education system or health service?

For this large a number of people I think it&#039;s a bit impractical, at this point I&#039;d say Anarchism could only really come into play in sparsely populated areas or after some kind of general population decrease.

				The only law should be: You can do anything you want, as long as it does not harm an innocent human.<br /><br />The idea of goverment police did not ever make much sense to me. What would make more sense would be multiple private instatutions that people hire to protect them, like the way health care should be. <br /><br />Taxes would be cut by 75-85% so people are able to afford things like this, taxes would be only used for things like roads, transportation, etc.<br /><br />I could never really figure out the best way to go with the public school system, but I will say public school teachers make way to much money for pretty much reading out of a book to kids. I think opportunities to learn should be made available, even though tons of money is spent on schooling how much do kids learn that is actually relavant and they could not learn on their own (shakespeare, history books, etc.)? Basically nothing, other than reading and writing. It is pretty much useless money.<br /><br />The goverment is really fucked up, something like this goverment plan would not happen though, we are stuck to this shit, I suppose their is a rare possability of riots going fuck all and anarchy taking place (this won&#039;t happen, to many people are brainwashed)

If you harm someone, and someone goes, what did you do that for, he did nothing wrong, and you go, he did such and such to me and therefore he was not innocent. There is no gauge of innocence there, that is one person asserting their claim over another. And then what is to stop that person going, well I thought he was innocent, so you have just harmed someone for no reason, I will now harm you. <br /><br />Not quite so simple. Just saying. If you implement one law, be prepared for many many more to come into existence. Thus we have the modern world.

				from Waking Life:<br /><br />If we&#039;re looking at the highlights of human development, you have to look at the evolution of the organism and then at the development of its interaction with the environment. Evolution of the organism will begin with the evolution of life perceived through the hominid coming to the evolution of mankind. Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon man. Now, interestingly, what you&#039;re looking at here are three strings: biological, anthropological -- development of the cities -- and cultural, which is human expression.<br /><br />Now, what you&#039;ve seen here is the evolution of populations, not so much the evolution of individuals. And in addition, if you look at the time scales that are involved here -- two billion years for life, six million years for the hominid, 100,000 years for mankind as we know it -- you&#039;re beginning to see the telescoping nature of the evolutionary paradigm. And then when you get to agricultural, when you get to scientific revolution and industrial revolution, you&#039;re looking at 10,000 years, 400 years, 150 years. Uou&#039;re seeing a further telescoping of this evolutionary time. What that means is that as we go through the new evolution, it&#039;s gonna telescope to the point we should be able to see it manifest itself within our lifetime, within this generation.<br /><br />The new evolution stems from information, and it stems from two types of information: digital and analog. The digital is artificial intelligence. The analog results from molecular biology, the cloning of the organism. And you knit the two together with neurobiology. Before on the old evolutionary paradigm, one would die and the other would grow and dominate. But under the new paradigm, they would exist as a mutually supportive, noncompetitive grouping. Okay, independent from the external.<br /><br />And what is interesting here is that evolution now becomes an individually centered process, emanating from the needs and desires of the individual, and not an external process, a passive process where the individual is just at the whim of the collective. So, you produce a neo-human, okay, with a new individuality and a new consciousness. But that&#039;s only the beginning of the evolutionary cycle because as the next cycle proceeds, the input is now this new intelligence. As intelligence piles on intelligence, as ability piles on ability, the speed changes. Until what? Until we reach a crescendo in a way could be imagined as an enormous instantaneous fulfillment of human? human and neo-human potential. It could be something totally different. It could be the amplification of the individual, the multiplication of individual existences. Parallel existences now with the individual no longer restricted by time and space.<br /><br />And the manifestations of this neo-human-type evolution, manifestations could be dramatically counter-intuitive. That&#039;s the interesting part. The old evolution is cold. It&#039;s sterile. It&#039;s efficient, okay? And its manifestations of those social adaptations. We&#039;re talking about parasitism, dominance, morality, okay? Uh, war, predation, these would be subject to de-emphasis. These will be subject to de-evolution. The new evolutionary paradigm will give us the human traits of truth, of loyalty, of justice, of freedom. These will be the manifestations of the new evolution. And that is what we would hope to see from this. That would be nice.

				There is enough to go around for everyone on the planet. The problem that has ruined it for everyone since documented history has been the greed to accumulate more and power for control. Greed and power are the biggest plagues on Planet Earth. <br /><br />At our current stage of evolution, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible for humans to function culturally outside of this vicious circle. Hopefully, the next step in evolution will resolve this.
