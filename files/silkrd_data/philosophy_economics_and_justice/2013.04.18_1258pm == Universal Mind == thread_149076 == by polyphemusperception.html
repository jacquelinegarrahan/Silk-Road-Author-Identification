				Yes&nbsp; :) On DMT and many other psychedelics. It is a very humbling experience, one that I have been fortunate enough to have felt while I am still quite young. I wish I could share this feeling of enlightenment and understanding of my place in our universe from my experiences with all my family members, but if I were to even mention that I&#039;ve taken many psychedelic drugs, they would all take it the wrong way...

				i have experienced this a few times... cosmic consciousness. it&#039;s just absolute bliss. your identity with the &quot;self&quot; is severed and you experience reality in its purest form, as the interconnectedness of all things. the buddhist metaphor of indra&#039;s net is a great example of this experience.

				I&#039;m an atheist too but wasn&#039;t until after I had some meaningful psychedelic experiences that I was able to explore other modes of thought and put them into a context that made sense of Quantum Mechanics and String Theory. I believe in an energy of sorts since that&#039;s the only &quot;word&quot; I can use to adequately describe it. If String Theory is correct it would help explain the Law of Thermodynamics and since energy cannot be created or destroyed we are connected in a way to everything. This helps explain the idea of collective consciousness and multiple dimensions a little easier. You can start with fractals and work your way backwards using mathematical theory it might help to get what I mean. This isn&#039;t described very well and it&#039;s only my perception of the big picture but it makes more sense than anything else to me. =)

				I get &quot;communion&quot; feelings on either large doses of LSD or shrooms, but they follow a regular pattern: with shrooms its like an alien intelligence (not necessarily not part of me, perhaps an unconscious part) visiting, while on LSD its a complete merging with the universe, like my body and mind are just wrinkles in the fabric that make up everything and everyone. Never do I take one of these two substances and have the other experience, though that could be the result of now-ingrained expectations.<br /><br />What has it meant to me? Well, once upon a time I used to (gently) laugh at the idea of entheogens, of spiritual experiences on drugs. I don&#039;t laugh anymore. It&#039;s also caused me to take a much dimmer view of legal restrictions on these things.

				I&#039;ve experienced this with LSD. To me it is like waking up from a dream.&nbsp; Universal Mind always seems more real than my finite mind.&nbsp; This experience has convinced that I am nothing but a thought-image inside the mind of an entity that is greater than myself. It could&nbsp; even be a computer, but I shudder at that possibility. If it&#039;s a computer, then we&#039;re all doomed. We are utterly trapped inside of the machine.&nbsp; I&#039;d much rather it be a loving being, and life more akin to a dream than a computer simulation. But whatever it is, there can be no doubt that it exists! It&#039;s aware of us. It is us. And it is controlling and directing everything. You can call it God if you want, but whatever we call it is just a symbol for THAT! It cannot be named or spoken of. Even to say what it is is to falsify it. It is beyond human understanding...<br /><br />With LSD, I experience Universal Mind as my own higher self. With mushrooms, I experience it as Other. There is a dualism with mushrooms.

				I would seek advice from professionals if that&#039;s the case. Not to say there is something wrong with you - but I would at least have someone give it a closer examination.<br /><br />For example; if I&#039;m psychotic when a friend is over and he starts looking for something of his that he can&#039;t find, I immediately start thinking that he thinks that I have taken it, even though I have absolutely no reason believing so. That&#039;s not healthy!<br /><br />It is important to know that hallucinations and psychosis are almost indistinguishable, if not entirely. People with psychosis may have one or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, catatonia, or a thought disorder, as described below. Impairments in social cognition also occur.<br /><br />DELUSIONS: Psychosis may involve delusional beliefs, some of which are paranoid in nature. Put simply, delusions are false beliefs which a person holds on to, without adequate evidence. It may be difficult to change the belief even with evidence to the contrary. Common themes of delusions are persecutory (person believes that others are out to harm him), grandiose (person believing that he or she has special powers or skills) etc. Depressed persons may have delusions consistent with their low mood e.g: delusions that they have sinned, or have contracted serious illness etc. Karl Jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into primary and secondary types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions may be understood as being influenced by the person&#039;s background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity, religious beliefs, superstitious belief).

Altered states of consciousness would be accessed in part, to come into a space of communion with the divine, thus creating as of the many side effects a sense of deep unity within. These states would be reached most often through the ingestion of plant substances by whatever means, combined with meditation, and guidance from a or multiple shamans.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it resonates with you, but that&#039;s how I&#039;d explain it.

Not to say there is something wrong with you - but I would at least have someone give it a closer examination.<br /><br />For example; if I&#039;m psychotic when a friend is over and he starts looking for something of his that he can&#039;t find, I immediately start thinking that he thinks that I have taken it, even though I have absolutely no reason believing so. That&#039;s not healthy!<br /><br />It is important to know that hallucinations and psychosis are almost indistinguishable, if not entirely. People with psychosis may have one or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, catatonia, or a thought disorder, as described below. Impairments in social cognition also occur.<br /><br />DELUSIONS: Psychosis may involve delusional beliefs, some of which are paranoid in nature. Put simply, delusions are false beliefs which a person holds on to, without adequate evidence. It may be difficult to change the belief even with evidence to the contrary. Common themes of delusions are persecutory (person believes that others are out to harm him), grandiose (person believing that he or she has special powers or skills) etc. Depressed persons may have delusions consistent with their low mood e.g: delusions that they have sinned, or have contracted serious illness etc. Karl Jaspers has classified psychotic delusions into primary and secondary types. Primary delusions are defined as arising suddenly and not being comprehensible in terms of normal mental processes, whereas secondary delusions may be understood as being influenced by the person&#039;s background or current situation (e.g., ethnicity, religious beliefs, superstitious belief).<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Lmao

Just unheard of/brushed aside in today&#039;s over-regulated societies. The knowledge of a supreme being is the beginning. Then can you begin to form a relationship with this being. <br /><br />And I truly believe that hallucinogenic substances can aid such a process in beginning, however, they are not adequate to sustain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;polyphemusperception, I think that this is an excellent experience, explore it!! However, be mindful that such communions can be attained without the help of &quot;mental medicine&quot;. <br /><br />Since that phrase got mentioned, think of it like this. <br /><br />If you are sick, you take medicine to get better, but soon you will no longer need that medicine for your body will be healed. <br />I believe the same for our current topic.

The god of pantheism is no different than the non-gods of atheism, in practice, because these are just abstract opinions.

				I feel like I&#039;ve been trying to get my head round this kind of experience for 20 years and it&#039;s difficult. The word &#039;God&#039; is so laced with prejudice, due to it&#039;s perversion through organised religion, but still, I would call it God. What I mean by &#039;God&#039; is Truth, The ultimate reality that the universe and everything in it including all of us is one interconnected conscious living being. Of course, this experience and this interpretation is very common. and has been written about by many others. This kind of experience is the original insight behind metaphors of God and Gods in all the different religions, even Christianity. The original story of Jesus was meant to illustrate the message that man (Jesus) and the universe (God) are one. The popular interpretation of this story is the result of 2000 years of manipulation and control by those whose power is threatened by it&#039;s original meaning, which is now, largely forgotten.<br /><br />Understandably, people have a hard time coming to terms with the idea that the percepion of their place in the universe, as a self-contained individual human being, separate from other human beings and the rest of the physical universe is an illusion. But really, every person is a creation of, and is sustained by the universe around them, physically, mentally, socially, in every way, so we are not separate from the universe. Everything is connected to everything else, through time and space and nothing exists in isolation. We are all one. For that eternal and infinite being, time and space don&#039;t even exist.<br /><br />Psychedelics dissolve our individual ego, built up our whole lives from our sense perceptions of time and space, so we see ourselves as we really are and see that we are one with the universe. By way of analogy at a microcosmic scale, I always think of our place in the universe like the individual cell in the human body. Is the individual cell conscious of it&#039;s own existence? and if so, would it see itself as a separate entity from all the other cells around it, competing for resources of oxygen and food it needs to survive for it&#039;s brief lifespan of a few years, or would it understand that it is a temporary but necessary component of the greater complete human being? releasing carbon dioxide back into the blood, which is breathed out by the human being and then used by the tree, with energy from the sun to create food via photosynthesis. So we are with the universe, just part of the one interconnected being.<br /><br />This is not just a physical connection, but our minds, emotions, dreams, aspirations, memories, personalities and everything that goes to make up our sense of &#039;me&#039; is the result of connections with other parts of our true self, the whole universe, outside the individual body of the human being. To go back to the op&#039;s question, as our individual minds are connected to the rest of the universe, the universe has universal mind. The universe therefore, is not just an inanimate collection of rocks floating around stars, but has consciousness. Current science observes that the state of existence of subatomic particles is actually determined by the consciousness which observes them, so we go full circle and can concieve that in the beginning, as we usually percieve it, consciousness was first and brought into being the physical universe. Sounds familiar?<br /><br />A new idea I&#039;m working with is that the scientists who concieved of the big bang actually created it and the universe just by thinking about it. Sounds impossible seeing as the big bang was billions of years ago and scientists only thought of it in the 20th century. However, Life, as far as we know, has only come into being as a unique event on the Earth. Life forms, such as ourselves, may be the centre of the universal consciousness responsible for creating the universe, simply by dreaming it into existence. If time and space do not exist for the universal mind then there is no reason why we could not cause something in our &#039;past&#039;. Actually it would seem that time was running backwards from our usual perspective. Could that be true, or have I just taken too many drugs?

I just think we have to call it truth (Lowercase t) if we&#039;re going to call it anything at all, and then we pursue it in as truth-oriented (reasonable) a manner as we can manage. <br /><br />While I cannot reasonably object to your *personal* preference for using the word &quot;God&quot; or capitalized &quot;Truth&quot;, I will point out: doing so means that the very deepest meanings of what you&#039;re trying to communicate will be misunderstood by the *majority* of fellow humans as validation of (or offense against) specific beliefs about the specific nature of the specific deities their specific culture has collectively imagined. To use these words in today&#039;s world is to be either incorrect or unavoidably misunderstood.

However, I believe that objective truth is the same as subjective truth if that subjective truth is appreciated as a metaphor for the objective truth. All religions have different names for god, but these can all be understood as the same god. Even within a polytheistic belief system such as Hinduism, many different Gods, eg. Ganesha, Krishna, Shiva, can be understood to be aspects of the greater Brahman. In Islam, the 99 different names of Allah, all describe the same Allah, even though many of the names appear contradictory. God is so great that it encompasses all possibilities. Misunderstanding will occur when these metaphors are interpreted literally, as they are, probably by the majority of religious believers, which causes religious conflict, but I hope that as the integration of races and cultures continues, we can move toward greater understanding that our individual conceptualizations of God describe the same objective truth. The global society has only just begun. It would take some time.

				Tobias.<br />How do you know that you are not literate enough to you truth. The Truth should be easy so and any one can understand. If the truth has to hide behind eloquent speech and difficult words that may make sense but most cannot grasp or understand fully. It is a form of deception in my opinion. So the truth should be easy so that you can explain it to a child.<br /><br />About religions not all religion are the same so make sense other do not. So worship one God some worship<br />many. <br />I do not know if you believe in God. But if you do how would you define God? If you have never meet him or seen Him. The only way we would no about God if He would inform us about Himself and His nature. Would you agree? <br />&nbsp;

At this point I can either try asking it in a different way, or find a different question altogether on which to spend my attention. I don&#039;t need to know everything. I cannot know everything.

But here we stand in the year 2013, still peering into the darkness of mystery, with the light of all of the knowledge of truth we have accumulated thus far, illuminating the simple fact that none of our religions turned out to be true. So we take the true things from those religions and we integrate them into our understanding of the cosmos, leaving what remains of religion as mythology. A glorious tapestry of human creativity, but not to be understood as non-fiction.<br /><br />(P.S. Couldn&#039;t resist the imagery. Thanks HappySmoke420 !)

The word &#039;God&#039; is so laced with prejudice, due to it&#039;s perversion through organised religion, but still, I would call it God. What I mean by &#039;God&#039; is Truth, The ultimate reality that the universe and everything in it including all of us is one interconnected conscious living being. Of course, this experience and this interpretation is very common. and has been written about by many others. This kind of experience is the original insight behind metaphors of God and Gods in all the different religions, even Christianity. The original story of Jesus was meant to illustrate the message that man (Jesus) and the universe (God) are one. The popular interpretation of this story is the result of 2000 years of manipulation and control by those whose power is threatened by it&#039;s original meaning, which is now, largely forgotten.<br /><br />Understandably, people have a hard time coming to terms with the idea that the percepion of their place in the universe, as a self-contained individual human being, separate from other human beings and the rest of the physical universe is an illusion. But really, every person is a creation of, and is sustained by the universe around them, physically, mentally, socially, in every way, so we are not separate from the universe. Everything is connected to everything else, through time and space and nothing exists in isolation. We are all one. For that eternal and infinite being, time and space don&#039;t even exist.<br /><br />Psychedelics dissolve our individual ego, built up our whole lives from our sense perceptions of time and space, so we see ourselves as we really are and see that we are one with the universe. By way of analogy at a microcosmic scale, I always think of our place in the universe like the individual cell in the human body. Is the individual cell conscious of it&#039;s own existence? and if so, would it see itself as a separate entity from all the other cells around it, competing for resources of oxygen and food it needs to survive for it&#039;s brief lifespan of a few years, or would it understand that it is a temporary but necessary component of the greater complete human being? releasing carbon dioxide back into the blood, which is breathed out by the human being and then used by the tree, with energy from the sun to create food via photosynthesis. So we are with the universe, just part of the one interconnected being.<br /><br />This is not just a physical connection, but our minds, emotions, dreams, aspirations, memories, personalities and everything that goes to make up our sense of &#039;me&#039; is the result of connections with other parts of our true self, the whole universe, outside the individual body of the human being. To go back to the op&#039;s question, as our individual minds are connected to the rest of the universe, the universe has universal mind. The universe therefore, is not just an inanimate collection of rocks floating around stars, but has consciousness. Current science observes that the state of existence of subatomic particles is actually determined by the consciousness which observes them, so we go full circle and can concieve that in the beginning, as we usually percieve it, consciousness was first and brought into being the physical universe. Sounds familiar?<br /><br />A new idea I&#039;m working with is that the scientists who concieved of the big bang actually created it and the universe just by thinking about it. Sounds impossible seeing as the big bang was billions of years ago and scientists only thought of it in the 20th century. However, Life, as far as we know, has only come into being as a unique event on the Earth. Life forms, such as ourselves, may be the centre of the universal consciousness responsible for creating the universe, simply by dreaming it into existence. If time and space do not exist for the universal mind then there is no reason why we could not cause something in our &#039;past&#039;. Actually it would seem that time was running backwards from our usual perspective. Could that be true, or have I just taken too many drugs?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>This is a beautiful post mate.&nbsp; I think it comes down to what you said &quot;We are all one. For that eternal and infinite being, time and space don&#039;t even exist.&quot;&nbsp; <br />For us to try to explain (in finite human terms and words) something so abstract, huge and beautiful is impossible.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s wrong to try and do so though, just that we have to be conscious of our positions as humans in the shadow/light of God (or whatever one wishes to call Him).&nbsp; It&#039;s the intentions that count!<br /><br />All IMHO of course :)<br /><br />Love to you

So to regard the mystical experience as invalid because it is related to brain activity is quite arbitrary and illogical -- all of our thoughts are related to brain activity. If I look through a telescope and see that Jupiter has a moon, that perception is conditioned by brain activity; just as if I experience God (Brahman).

				very interesting topic, and something close to my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp; In my mind I have absolutely NO doubt we ARE ALL &#039;connected&#039; in the ways folks have mentioned here and more!<br /><br />When I was very young, maybe 3-4yo I remember being able to &quot;know&quot; what people were thinking without being told.&nbsp; I clearly recall playing with my sisters when our mother would come home.<br />Mum was an alcoholic and rather moody, so we would be &#039;careful&#039; when approaching her! <br />&nbsp;<br />However, we could &#039;tell&#039; her &#039;mood&#039; from a distance without speaking to her!&nbsp; We would gather at the back door, just&nbsp; AS SOON AS she entered the front door we would &quot;know&quot; how she was!!<br /><br />We would say to each other (as it seemed we never disagreed on this) either &quot;mums in a good mood&quot; and run up to see her OR &quot;mums not happy/angry&quot; and then we would run off back into the yard to avoid her!&nbsp; Take of this what you will...<br /><br />However imo Tobias HAS nailed it with this comment ...&quot;A new idea I&#039;m working with is that the scientists who concieved of the big bang actually created it and the universe just by thinking about it.&quot;<br /><br />This idea is often called &quot;The hundredth monkey phenomena&quot;<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />&quot;100th Monkey Syndrome - How change happens?<br /><br />The Japanese monkey, Macaca fuscata, had been observed in the wild for a period of over 30 years. In 1952, on the island of Koshima, scientists were providing monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand. The monkey liked the taste of the raw sweet potatoes, but they found the dirt unpleasant.<br /><br />An 18-month-old female named Imo found she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes in a nearby stream. She taught this trick to her mother. Her playmates also learned this new way and they taught their mothers too.<br /><br />This cultural innovation was gradually picked up by various monkeys before the eyes of the scientists. Between 1952 and 1958 all the young monkeys learned to wash the sandy sweet potatoes to make them more palatable. Only the adults who imitated their children learned this social improvement. Other adults kept eating the dirty sweet potatoes.<br /><br />Then something startling took place. In the autumn of 1958, a certain number of Koshima monkeys were washing sweet potatoes -- the exact number is not known. Let us suppose that when the sun rose one morning there were 99 monkeys on Koshima Island who had learned to wash their sweet potatoes. Let&#039;s further suppose that later that morning, the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes.<br /><br />THEN IT HAPPENED! By that evening almost everyone in the tribe was washing sweet potatoes before eating them. The added energy of this hundredth monkey somehow created an ideological breakthrough!<br /><br />But notice: A most surprising thing observed by these scientists was that the habit of washing sweet potatoes then jumped over the sea...Colonies of monkeys on other islands and the mainland troop of monkeys at Takasakiyama began washing their sweet potatoes. Thus, when a certain critical number achieves an awareness, this new awareness may be communicated from mind to mind.&quot;<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />&nbsp;Now I totally believe we are ALL &#039;capable&#039; of &#039;sharing our thoughts&#039; in an unspoken way (aka &#039;telepathy&#039; etc) which I hhave experienced many many times, at first with a few particular people and later, at times, almost at will.&nbsp; I would HAVE TO &#039;check&#039; my thinking in some situations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Almost everone HAS experienced this stuff HOWEVER most dismiss it as &quot;co-incidence!&quot;&nbsp; which it aint!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />This stuff fascinated me from way back, so when I heard the story about groups of humans experiencing the same thing, well shit!!! <br />Finally I had a great &#039;example&#039; of something I had KNOWN about most of my life!<br /><br />I have experienced many many examples of this and made a conscious decision to ALWAYS re-assess any &quot;coincidental&quot; situations, and in doing this I noticed a number of similarities whenever these &#039;co-incidences&#039; occured.&nbsp; You will to IF you make an effort to.<br /><br />And here&#039;s some &#039;independent proof&#039; of this occuring IRL!!.... <br />Back in the 1990&#039;s there were three INDEPENDENT research groups who were all working on these super cooled gasses called &quot;Bose_Einstein Condensates&quot; aka BEC&#039;s<br />&nbsp;<br />(**clearnet warning**)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate <br /><br />To actually create these hypothetical substances in the lab was&nbsp; Nobel Prizewinning material!<br /><br />well, 3 INDEPENDENT research groups actually handed their &#039;papers&#039; in SO close in time to each other (IIRC it was within 24hrs!) that they ALL&nbsp; WON&nbsp; THE&nbsp; PRIZE&nbsp; TOGETHER!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;(**clearnet warning**)&nbsp; http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2001/oct/09/nobel-prize-for-bose-condensates<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />This was the first of a number of these events in science and&nbsp; other disciplines etc<br /><br /><br />I hope someone finds this as interesting as I do<br /><br />regards m m m motek :o :)

				I&#039;m not totally sure what the responses to my post are trying to argue.<br /><br />What I was trying to say, is that yes, OBVIOUSLY, there is a physical aspect taking place in our &quot;brains&quot;, but the experience itself is no less transcendent due to that realization. It can still be more real and powerful than anything else. Just because there is a chemical floating around in my head doesn&#039;t mean that my perception isn&#039;t halfway to heaven, either, and anyone who disagrees speaks from ignorance since consciousness, our existence, and the true nature of reality are things we fail to comprehend.<br /><br />Despite what you want to believe, we understand the psychedelic state about as much as we understand our own consciousness.<br /><br />Not very well.

You&#039;ve got an anti-Christian bias,&nbsp; so you don&#039;t like the idea of people experiencing God, because of its associations with the Christian religion. I&#039;m not a Christian, but I don&#039;t have that bias, so it doesn&#039;t bother me if the experience of the unity of the self with the divine ground of being (Samadhi) is used to reinforce one&#039;s belief in the truth of Christianity. At the transcendental and mystical level, all religions are one.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re just flat-out ignoring that common understanding word &quot;God&quot; is wildly different than what you mean when you say it. I would love for everyone to experience what you&#039;re calling &quot;God&quot;, but to call all religions &quot;one&quot; is patently disengenous. Religions differ, and because of their overreaching claims of universality, that they do so is both a direct and indirect cause of fear, anger, violence, and many other kinds of suffering. You&#039;re just conveniently glossing over this, as it destroys your kumbaya all is perfect and all is one bullshit. At the &quot;transcendental and mystical level&quot; that may be true, but all humans must spend their lives existing in the here and now. Even when you&#039;re experiencing transcendence, you are still here now. Which means that your solipsistic BS has dire consequences.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: joywind</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=149076.msg1141870#msg1141870">Quote from: abitpeckish on May 18, 2013, 07:42 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">When you say &quot;God&quot;, the vast majority of our species understands you to mean a specific, and specifically human-like personality.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>God is a human-like personality because it possesses an &quot;I&quot; -- it is &quot;I&quot;, the most anthropocentric conception of all. Actually, it&#039;s not so much God that is anthromorphic, but Man who is theomorphic.&nbsp; At a higher level God is pure nondual awareness, beyond good and evil, beyond the dichotomy of subject and object, mind and matter, etc. God is everything and nothing. It all depends on your perspective. There are different levels of awareness of God, all of which are valid. To call it God is perfectly&nbsp; valid because it&#039;s what the founders of all major religions meant by God. It may be that its deeper meaning cannot be communicated by human language, so the exoteric FOLLOWERS of those religions developed cultural attachments surrounding the God-conception, but when Jesus spoke of God, he meant precisely what Hindus meant by Brahman, Buddhists by emptiness, Neoplatonic philosophers by the One, etc., etc.<br /><br />Moreover it possesses the properties traditionally ascribed to God -- the property of creating phenomena, awareness, sacredness, etc. So it may be called God without any abuse of language -- to insist against its use is to engage in semanticism.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Given your premise &quot;God is a human-like personality because it possesses an &quot;I&quot; -- it is &quot;I&quot;, everything you have said here also applies to any other conscious being. Such as my cat. So yeah, your argument for an anthropocentric god falls flat.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: joywind</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: abitpeckish</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> I&#039;m skeptical about our ability to communicate what *you&#039;re* talking about to these people while using the same word, and I&#039;m pessimistic that we will ever be able to do so without choosing different, less connotatively-encumbered words.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>All concepts of God are anthropocentric, whether you conceive of God as an old gentleman with a long white beard who sits on a golden throne, or think of him as pure awareness, or pure being, or universe itself . It doesn&#039;t matter if you think of God as &quot;necessary being&quot;, as Thomas Aquinas thought of God, or as an undifferentiated void, or as the infinite essence -- however rarefied those concepts sound, they are just as anthropomorphic, that is to say, JUST AS HUMAN AND IN THE FORM OF THE HUMAN MIND, as the picture of God as the old gentleman with the white beard. All concepts are anthropomorhphic.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree that all *linguistic* concepts are anthropocentric, by the very nature of language. Therefore all linguistic forms of the concept you are talking about are insufficient and ultimately false on myriad levels.

To qualify the underlying unity as &#039;pantheistic&#039; is to deny the relativity of things and attribute an autonomous reality to dependent being. In such a worldview, there would be nothing beyond manifestation -- an idea that is quite foreign to the thought of Vedanta, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Platonism, and all other major religions and spiritual philosophies.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You have thus far presented no good reason to posit anything beyond &quot;nothingness&quot; and manifestation. Neither of those things require or even imply a singular &quot;God&quot; consciousness. It is we humans that try to attach that singular god, in an effort to understand what we cannot understand. In doing so, understanding is necessarily precluded. This can have, does have, and has throughout history had the most horrific of consequences.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: joywind</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: abitpeckish</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">You conclude a singular, canonical consciousness from your experience of ego-death/emptiness/self-transcendence/universality/singularity/oneness/etc.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>God doesn&#039;t fit into any of your convenient categories.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;re the one categorizing, in that you give the concept a name and defend it as such. So yeah, the concept doesn&#039;t fit into YOUR categories. I resign myself to talking ABOUT the concept without attaching the hubris of understanding to it. You continue to make gnostic claims you cannot support, and then you build more claims upon those claims.

Since I refuse to claim definitive knowledge of the existence of a singularly conscious god, I am lying about having experienced that phenomenon?

				That&#039;s why i think psychedelic drugs also occur in nature to help us understanding those mind boggling things.<br /><br />My perception of &#039;God&#039; is probably someone who can create life and environment , posses immortality , and is beyond the concept of &#039;time&#039; as we know it. but hes wisdom is not infinite but rather extremely intelligent.&nbsp; And such knowledge in my opinion is obtainable and possible for the human race to achieve in matter of time , I do believe that humans have the potential and the capabilities to understand those things you describe and some theories are already catching up with the idea (quantum mechanics &amp; string theories) what you experienced in my opinion has nothing to do with &#039;God&#039; but rather some of the powers that govern the universe and make it tick! I spouse those things will become more clear in the future it&#039;s just a matter of time.<br /><br />I would also like to share a unique experience i had in one of my trips that helped me realise that minds are connected.<br />I remember that for like few seconds i was actually able to connect&nbsp; to some one else mind and see things through her eyes , I received a clear image of her petting a kitten who was sitting in a cradle in some sort of a garden and it felt so realistic but ofcourse i was aware of me taking drugs and things like that may occur but i wasn&#039;t sure that it had anything to do with reality&nbsp; , After few seconds the connection was lost and immediately i typed the exact time and day that the event took place . A week later i had a conversation with the girl i thought i connected with (Which we&#039;re really close to me in many ways) and i asked her that is it possible that on Thursday noon she went outside the garden and pet one of her cats , She immediately responded in what i describe some sort of a shock! she told me that she felt really strange in that particular moment and she didn&#039;t know why ! I immediately told her that on the exact same time i felt some sort of a connection with her and i couldn&#039;t really understand what happened and why i was seeing this but it was so real .. i was tripping and she wasn&#039;t but the event i described seeing really took place and it made me understand several things that really changed my perception of life! As people described here in the post.. we are all connected ! <br /><br />We should cherish our life and what we have because we&#039;re experiencing something incredible !&nbsp; :)

				Haven&#039;t read the whole thread, but....<br /><br />While on/meditating on large doses of mushrooms, I&#039;ve often slipped away into the reality typically encountered during DMT use. (not nearly as clear/vivid as when using DMT though).<br /><br />I wonder if my consciousness is actually traveling into the DMT reality, or the mushrooms just make it easier to remember that reality, or if those two ideas are one in the same.<br /><br />Maybe not a universal mind, but still a different universe inhabited by the DMT people, reached through mushroom use and meditation.

In your future psychonautic travels, perhaps it might help for you to remind yourself that everything you experience is the product of your brain interpreting the constant data stream of existence. Your brain (or possibly CNS) is constantly working to make sense of the data firehose of the cosmos, interpreting it as &quot;files and folders&quot; that are recognizable and usable. I know that&#039;s esoteric as hell, but recognizing this can help us achieve a level of skepticism appropriate for gleaning true meaning from our experiences.

In 1952, on the island of Koshima, scientists were providing monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand. The monkey liked the taste of the raw sweet potatoes, but they found the dirt unpleasant.<br /><br />An 18-month-old female named Imo found she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes in a nearby stream. She taught this trick to her mother. Her playmates also learned this new way and they taught their mothers too.<br /><br />This cultural innovation was gradually picked up by various monkeys before the eyes of the scientists. Between 1952 and 1958 all the young monkeys learned to wash the sandy sweet potatoes to make them more palatable. Only the adults who imitated their children learned this social improvement. Other adults kept eating the dirty sweet potatoes.<br /><br />Then something startling took place. In the autumn of 1958, a certain number of Koshima monkeys were washing sweet potatoes -- the exact number is not known. Let us suppose that when the sun rose one morning there were 99 monkeys on Koshima Island who had learned to wash their sweet potatoes. Let&#039;s further suppose that later that morning, the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes.<br /><br />THEN IT HAPPENED! By that evening almost everyone in the tribe was washing sweet potatoes before eating them. The added energy of this hundredth monkey somehow created an ideological breakthrough!<br /><br />But notice: A most surprising thing observed by these scientists was that the habit of washing sweet potatoes then jumped over the sea...Colonies of monkeys on other islands and the mainland troop of monkeys at Takasakiyama began washing their sweet potatoes. Thus, when a certain critical number achieves an awareness, this new awareness may be communicated from mind to mind.&quot;<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />&nbsp;Now I totally believe we are ALL &#039;capable&#039; of &#039;sharing our thoughts&#039; in an unspoken way (aka &#039;telepathy&#039; etc) which I hhave experienced many many times, at first with a few particular people and later, at times, almost at will.&nbsp; I would HAVE TO &#039;check&#039; my thinking in some situations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Almost everone HAS experienced this stuff HOWEVER most dismiss it as &quot;co-incidence!&quot;&nbsp; which it aint!&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />This stuff fascinated me from way back, so when I heard the story about groups of humans experiencing the same thing, well shit!!! <br />Finally I had a great &#039;example&#039; of something I had KNOWN about most of my life!<br /><br />I have experienced many many examples of this and made a conscious decision to ALWAYS re-assess any &quot;coincidental&quot; situations, and in doing this I noticed a number of similarities whenever these &#039;co-incidences&#039; occured.&nbsp; You will to IF you make an effort to.<br /><br />And here&#039;s some &#039;independent proof&#039; of this occuring IRL!!.... <br />Back in the 1990&#039;s there were three INDEPENDENT research groups who were all working on these super cooled gasses called &quot;Bose_Einstein Condensates&quot; aka BEC&#039;s<br />&nbsp;<br />(**clearnet warning**)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate <br /><br />To actually create these hypothetical substances in the lab was&nbsp; Nobel Prizewinning material!<br /><br />well, 3 INDEPENDENT research groups actually handed their &#039;papers&#039; in SO close in time to each other (IIRC it was within 24hrs!) that they ALL&nbsp; WON&nbsp; THE&nbsp; PRIZE&nbsp; TOGETHER!!!<br /><br />&nbsp;(**clearnet warning**)&nbsp; http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2001/oct/09/nobel-prize-for-bose-condensates<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />This was the first of a number of these events in science and&nbsp; other disciplines etc<br /><br /><br />I hope someone finds this as interesting as I do<br /><br />regards m m m motek :o :)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=149076.msg1146055#msg1146055">Quote from: Tobias on May 20, 2013, 04:11 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I feel like I&#039;ve been trying to get my head round this kind of experience for 20 years and it&#039;s difficult. The word &#039;God&#039; is so laced with prejudice, due to it&#039;s perversion through organised religion, but still, I would call it God. What I mean by &#039;God&#039; is Truth, The ultimate reality that the universe and everything in it including all of us is one interconnected conscious living being. Of course, this experience and this interpretation is very common. and has been written about by many others. This kind of experience is the original insight behind metaphors of God and Gods in all the different religions, even Christianity. The original story of Jesus was meant to illustrate the message that man (Jesus) and the universe (God) are one. The popular interpretation of this story is the result of 2000 years of manipulation and control by those whose power is threatened by it&#039;s original meaning, which is now, largely forgotten.<br /><br />Understandably, people have a hard time coming to terms with the idea that the percepion of their place in the universe, as a self-contained individual human being, separate from other human beings and the rest of the physical universe is an illusion. But really, every person is a creation of, and is sustained by the universe around them, physically, mentally, socially, in every way, so we are not separate from the universe. Everything is connected to everything else, through time and space and nothing exists in isolation. We are all one. For that eternal and infinite being, time and space don&#039;t even exist.<br /><br />Psychedelics dissolve our individual ego, built up our whole lives from our sense perceptions of time and space, so we see ourselves as we really are and see that we are one with the universe. By way of analogy at a microcosmic scale, I always think of our place in the universe like the individual cell in the human body. Is the individual cell conscious of it&#039;s own existence? and if so, would it see itself as a separate entity from all the other cells around it, competing for resources of oxygen and food it needs to survive for it&#039;s brief lifespan of a few years, or would it understand that it is a temporary but necessary component of the greater complete human being? releasing carbon dioxide back into the blood, which is breathed out by the human being and then used by the tree, with energy from the sun to create food via photosynthesis. So we are with the universe, just part of the one interconnected being.<br /><br />This is not just a physical connection, but our minds, emotions, dreams, aspirations, memories, personalities and everything that goes to make up our sense of &#039;me&#039; is the result of connections with other parts of our true self, the whole universe, outside the individual body of the human being. To go back to the op&#039;s question, as our individual minds are connected to the rest of the universe, the universe has universal mind. The universe therefore, is not just an inanimate collection of rocks floating around stars, but has consciousness. Current science observes that the state of existence of subatomic particles is actually determined by the consciousness which observes them, so we go full circle and can concieve that in the beginning, as we usually percieve it, consciousness was first and brought into being the physical universe. Sounds familiar?<br /><br />A new idea I&#039;m working with is that the scientists who concieved of the big bang actually created it and the universe just by thinking about it. Sounds impossible seeing as the big bang was billions of years ago and scientists only thought of it in the 20th century. However, Life, as far as we know, has only come into being as a unique event on the Earth. Life forms, such as ourselves, may be the centre of the universal consciousness responsible for creating the universe, simply by dreaming it into existence. If time and space do not exist for the universal mind then there is no reason why we could not cause something in our &#039;past&#039;. Actually it would seem that time was running backwards from our usual perspective. Could that be true, or have I just taken too many drugs?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />loved it.
