				CLEAR NET****&nbsp; http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/01/bradley-manning-wikileaks-statement-full-text<br /><br />Quote&nbsp; &quot;Unlike other times using the submission form above, I did not activate the TOR anonymizer.&quot;<br /><br />Did I read that correct? He&#039;s saying he didn&#039;t use Tor, he uploaded straight to WLOs website?

				Was probably a big file and he was in a hurry? I pray for him all the time. I cried when I saw &quot;Collateral Murder&quot; especially know that the people in the van had kids and were trying to rescue badly wounded or dead friends.They let killers keep killing andprosecute the witness to the crime...

				I support Manning completely but I admit I&#039;m not up on how he did things. Does this imply that he was always using tor and this one time he slipped up/forgot? Wow. Lesson learned.<br /><br />goblin

				IIRC - manning was busted after foolishly admitting to giving classified documents to wikileaks in &#039;chats&#039; with some hacker who turned him in.&nbsp; That&#039;s the official story anyway.

				Bradley Manning was busted for talking to a black-turned-white-turned-mustard-hat &quot;hacker&quot; that gained his trust, led him on, and turned him in.
