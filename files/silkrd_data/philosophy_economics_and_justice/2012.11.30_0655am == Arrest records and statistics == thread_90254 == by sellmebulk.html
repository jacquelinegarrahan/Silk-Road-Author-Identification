				Ok so everyone is concerned about getting busted by a LEA. Its good to be cautious and protective. What I want to know is how many cases are there of people being prosecuted from what they have done on SR? Not just in the states but the level of government involvement in other countries as well.<br /><br />I have looked in depth for this data and have not found much. Some promises to shut down SR. A vendor who got nailed by local police in possession. <br /><br />I have heard that SR is not in mainstream media to prevent an epidemic; this I believe. But court records are public so has anyone searched and found specific indictments? <br />

				Oh yeah people have been arrested from using SR. Though this usually comes from human error and not technical error.

				How does one get arrested for using SR?<br /><br />Perhaps its possible if your computer has been infected with malware, or if you order something from a seller that isn&#039;t legit.<br /><br />Also, people may have been arrested for possession or use of substances ordered though SR<br /><br />On the other hand, is there anyone that has been convicted for a crime solely by ordering some substance on SR, and nothing else? I&#039;d be interesting to see examples of that, although i don&#039;t fear such situations since i&#039;m not in the US.

				i saw a story a couple months ago about a couple of teens who had packages from overseas shipped to there parents house where they lived in the USA<br />the parents got worried and called the police saying random packages where showing up and they were addressed to there kids...<br /><br />ended up the parents got there own kids in trouble and the scared little kids told on themselves .. im not sure on every detail but thats the basis of the story.. <br />most of it is people getting told on by the person they live with .. gf, parents.. shit like that.. <br />then they tell on themselves .. <br /><br />i really think that if you had no one telling on u and they didnt find ur computer or link u to the bitcoins.. the case would be dropped..<br />it simply is not enough to say prove your guilty just because a package was sent to your house even if it is in your name.. no judge would rule against you if that was the only evidence <br /><br />THEY HAVE TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT U KNEW ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKAGE AND THAT YOU IN FACT ORDERED IT<br /><br />the problem lies in people.. the people who use this site... not knowing how the law works.. and they end up taking a plea bargin or telling on themselves by talking to the cops.. <br />if you order drugs on here u have to be ready to keep you mouth shut if you get busted get a lawyer.. and also maybe doing a couple months in jail if worse comes to worse and waiting it out till they drop the charges or maybe give you a sentence that u are happy with like maybe pleading guilty and taking time served with probation for a year and the charge coming off your record when ur probation is over.. (i would never take that deal but hey.. to each his own) that is if your scared of loosing in trial..

				Thats funny lorax; cannot believe parents dimed out their own kids.<br /><br />People are almost always getting in trouble because&nbsp; no one can keep their mouths shut. I have watched several people personally who did it to themselves. <br /><br />If people have been arrested for using SR than who, for what, where, when? I wasent looking for an &quot;Oh yeah dude&quot; response but rather some specifics. <br /><br />Thanks lorax.<br />

				With Silk Road police are facing a situation like the underground tunnels underneath the border between Mexico and America. Nobody had a clue how tons on cocaine were entering America. <br />It took them few decades to catch the guys if I recall correctly. They knew tons of drugs are entering but they didn&#039;t know how.<br /><br />They are aware of the situation but they can&#039;t really stop it unless they put DPR away and take the servers which is one chance in 6,973,738,433.<br /><br />Good luck motherfuckers!<br /><br />

				It will be extremely difficult to get any sort of statistics on arrest and criminal records. But, the first thing you can try is search news sources database for the past 3 years for the mention of term &quot;Silkroad&quot;, and I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find a few local newspapers reporting on arrests tied to Silkroad. However, a lot of police departments are ignorant about online drug trade, and so are a lot of journalists - so even if arrest was Silkroad-related, it is likely not reported as such.<br /><br />Over the course of a year I remember seeing a few threads of buyers who reported police having knocked on the door, some even had search performed in their apartment. However, I also recall a few &quot;vendor bust&quot; news - such as trojan from Canada. They are extremely rare, though.<br /><br />Finally, I&#039;d like to stress that any Silkroad-related arrest is 99.9% likely to result from lead coming from outside of Silkroad - such as suspicious neighbors busting a vendor, suspicious mailman, packages being intercepted by customs, etc. Silkroad platform itself is pretty damn secure, and if you put some common sense into ordering + shipping, then you should be very very safe as a buyer here. Of course, risk goes up with larger orders and international orders.

				Well, shipping packages to your parents address seems rather stupid to do without informing your parents something will be arriving for you shortly. I suppose calling the police is something not to expect, but just telling them you expect -something- to be delivered from abroad would be a good idea.<br /><br />
