				I&#039;ve never personally seen a ghost or a UFO. But with all the people that say they have seen them, I can&#039;t believe they are ALL telling a story. What do you think, do you have an experience?

				If I went 2,000 years back in time and set off fireworks in front of a group of people, they all would have &quot;seen&quot; me perform some supernatural miracle. In reality, they simply wouldn&#039;t have understood what they saw so they&#039;d make some shit up to make themselves feel better. <br /><br />People who claim to see UFOs and ghosts are the same way. They don&#039;t understand what they saw, so their childish intellects make up a story that gives them a sense of security. <br /><br />If you have the urge to throw a hissy fit along the lines of &quot;but I saw blah blah blah and you can&#039;t explain that and I swear I know what I saw and you&#039;re stupid because it came from a different dimension/reality and therefore leaves no evidence&quot; after reading this then I have news for you; your anecdote doesn&#039;t mean shit. Go get a degree in natural science and demonstrably PROVE that UFOs and ghosts and spirits and angels and elves are real. <br /><br />I understand that we have a lot to learn about the universe, but I also understand that people are fucking stupid. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Remember that.

				A lot of people who claim to have seen ghosts and aliens happen to see them while their in bed, you know... suddenly awoken in the night. They&#039;re still in a deep sleep state and can have hypnogogic hallucinations. It&#039;s happened to me a number of times. One time I was really close to felling asleep, I opened my eyes and there was someone at the foot of my bed. He walked around my bed, towards me with a knife. It didn&#039;t quite seem real and I couldn&#039;t work out how I didn&#039;t hear him come on, as I hadn&#039;t yet completely fallen asleep. So I threw a shirt at him and he disappeared. It was scary as shit. <br /><br />Another time, similar situation, opened my eyes and saw an almost transparent imagine of my room mate sitting on a chair next to me. It seemed like he was watching over me, but I knew my friend was alive and when I went to touch him, my hand went through him and he disappeared. Easily mistakable for a ghost if you don&#039;t understand hypnotic hallucinations... especially if you see someone you know is deceased. <br /><br />Overall, I believe in spirits and energies being present but I don&#039;&#039;t believe in the sensationalized expression of&nbsp; ghosts in certain societies. <br />

				I believe in ghosts I sweat a few times in my life I have felt a presence in my comfort zone and have even seen ghosts so yea I&#039;m def a believer in that there are some type of beings,spirits,ghosts,demons etc in our daily lives.&nbsp; Our world is huge and the universe even bigger there are just way to many unquestioned things in our lives.

				I felt a creepy crawly sort of presence once on a grade school field trip. I&#039;m not going to name the place because it would give my general area. At the time I didn&#039;t think &quot;ghost&quot;, just a feeling that made me uncomfortable, nervous and nauseous. <br /><br />Years later I hear this place is seriously &quot;haunted&quot; by teams of pseudo-legit ghost hunting teams. <br /><br />In short I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s possible.

				Sleep paralysis is a key contender for most alien abduction, ghosts in the night, etc stories - google it. <br /><br />I&#039;ve had this, and now I know what it is - i&#039;m cool with it. Scary as fuck when it happens though.

				i always catch people out when they tell me they saw a ghost by asking them to describe it. i start with male/female, young/old stuff like that. then i get to what was it wearing. as soon as they answer i point out that clothes aren&#039;t part of your body so if you did have a spirit and it left your body, then it would be naked. there&#039;s just no way a ghost would be wearing clothes.<br /><br />like a previous poster said, just coz you can&#039;t explain what or why you saw something, doesn&#039;t mean its supernatural.i&#039;ve seen plenty supenatural things, usually when i&#039;m on acid or similar, so i know full well how the mind can play tricks on you.
