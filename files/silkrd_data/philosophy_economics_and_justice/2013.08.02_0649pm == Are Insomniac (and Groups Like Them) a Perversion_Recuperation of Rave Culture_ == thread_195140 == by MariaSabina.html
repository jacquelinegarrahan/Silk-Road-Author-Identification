				I think Insomniac Events used to be an awesome group.&nbsp; Not anymore.&nbsp; Briefly, here&#039;s why.<br /><br />1)&nbsp; They think they are out to provide an experience.&nbsp; This promotes passive consumption and eliminates the DIY ethic of a rave.<br />2)&nbsp; They conduct TSA-style searches as a condition of entrance to their events.<br />3)&nbsp; They are cooperating with narcotics officers who are working inside and outside of the parties to enforce drug laws.<br />4)&nbsp; They have or have had rules which are ridiculous, or at least very questionable.&nbsp; Here are just a few.&nbsp; No sitting on the dance floor, which they enforced through &quot;Get Up and Dance Crews&quot; -- what happened to cuddle puddles?&nbsp; No wearing of masks, so no Anonymous, Guy Fawkes, DPR, bandit, gas-mask, etc.-type costuming -- what happened to being able to dress how you want?<br />5)&nbsp; Their ticket prices are ridiculously expensive.<br />6)&nbsp; They mostly book big-name, famous DJs and producers, leaving few if any slots open for local and/or upcoming cats.<br />7)&nbsp; They heavily promote consumption of alcohol.<br />8)&nbsp; The are trying to turn into a nation-wide (or maybe even world-wide) company, pushing out local promotion &quot;competition&quot;.<br /><br />A lot of promoters are running things in a similar way.&nbsp; Why are people spending so much money going to these type of events when they could put that money together and throw their own parties that would function as temporary autonomous zones?

				Do you really think that Insomniac could even pull off such an event without participating with the police?...Just read the Rave Act.As much as everyone loves an underground free-for-all, in order for the party to continue certain rules need to be followed. Insurance/permit would require it.Even Ibiza went through a crack down....I have been to a few EDC parties and the events are a lot of fun. Like it or not EDM has gone mainstream.
