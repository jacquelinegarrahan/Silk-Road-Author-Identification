				Highly recommended. <br /><br />I read it. Dropped some acid after.<br />my trip was exactly like the book. The instructions are very very handy. I was able to destroy the bad vibes in an instant with the power of realization. Illusion. A giant triangle of illumination appeared. and swept away the bad vibes and daemons in an instant. <br />Like a charm, or some magic.&nbsp; <br />Without the teachings of the book i would have spent an eternity in hell. But I was able to flip out of it. <br />Without the teachings of the book last night would have been the most horrible night of my life. <br />And i was able to turn it into the most amazing experience. Alone. In complete darkness. Without music. Only my mind. <br /><br />&quot;A Buddha is one who is awake to the truth, one who has left behind emotions such as anger and desire and has deep wisdom and inner peace. In short, it is someone who has reached enlightenment.&quot;<br /><br />If you are experimenting with psychedelics<br />(does not matter if you are&nbsp; Sitter or Tripper.)<br />&nbsp;You need to&nbsp; read it!

				An experienced tripper can indeed direct his trip, and change the &quot;subject&quot; when it&#039;s getting too dark. Ayahuasca taught me that, your beliefs and thoughts direct the trip, and they have as much power in real life. Your life is what you think it is. <br /><br />On the topic of the book, I was thinking of reading the version commented by Leary &amp; Alpert (freely available on the web). On a related note, I found and ordered Ram Dass&#039; &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, can&#039;t wait to have it. It seems like the best spirituality book ever written.

				You know, I want to like McKenna&#039;s writing, but I just don&#039;t.<br /><br />Stopped in to say that what the TBotD did for you, the new-ish Tibetan Book of Living and Dying did for me. Flipped open a random page which turned out to be about mantras, learned that mantra means protection for the mind, and not long after found myself on one hell of a crazy trip thinking I was losing it completely. Remembered the passage, picked up the book, and it saved my ass. Essential companion to tripping and soul/life-searching, for me. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

				Necromancy is a great hobby.<br /><br />There are a lot of books on the topic written recently and from history.

				DOC and Rob Zombie... I am the devil.&nbsp; 8)<br /><br />Praying is not about being &quot;spiritual&quot;. It&#039;s about a meditation during which you focus on what you want, whether it&#039;s in life, in relationships, or some other personal thought. Praying is about seeking an answer to stress that inexorably exists in everyone&#039;s life... All too human.

Flipped open a random page which turned out to be about mantras, learned that mantra means protection for the mind, and not long after found myself on one hell of a crazy trip thinking I was losing it completely. Remembered the passage, picked up the book, and it saved my ass. Essential companion to tripping and soul/life-searching, for me. I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>oh yeah, that&#039;s a great read as well. on a related note... a few years ago i tripped on mescaline for the first time. it also happened to be my first trip since my mom had passed away. so i wandered into her room and started peaking. completely overwhelmed by her energy. i was rolling around on her bed crying when her copy of the tibetan book of living and dying fell on my head! i turned on the lights, opened it up, and saw that she had folded over pages on preparing for death...<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />! One of those moments where the universe seems to be raising an eyebrow in your direction. Thanks for sharing that.
