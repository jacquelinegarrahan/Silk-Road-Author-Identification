				I have been thinking about the fact that humans poop plantfood while the plants grow humanfood from that poop..<br /><br />So what would you do if there was a store that enabled you to take a dump in a very clean and nicelookin fresh toilet and then we look up how much the pile of poop weigh, then youre let into a store with free vegetables and fruits and you can pick the same weight of food as your poop weigh.. For free. Or should I say for poop.<br /><br />Its gotta be high quality poop tho and only from healthyeating people otherwise the plants and fruits would die since if its substances in the poop then they would be stuck in the fruits and plants, but if you only get food from this stoe Im visualising then you would eat only organic and no substances so your poop would be alrigt for plants consumption.<br /><br />It is possible to grow hydrophonic organic fruits and veggies using poop is what I estimate, and it could probably be done in different rooms also so the fruits and veggies grow in one room and the root and poop in one room.<br /><br />I know it would be sustainable at least and it just hit me that old vegetables and the peeled outer layer from fruits could also be weighed as poop so if you did not eat all the fuits and veggies until they got to old to eat, then come down and we trade the old fruits for some new ones since our plantfriends, nature, the sun and machines work together to tranform shit and rotten vegetables to fresh vegetables.<br /><br />They actually do steal the human poop and use it to grow so they know about the value of human poop.. The poopers dont care tho and thats weird since we all could use some free organic fruit and veggies once in a while, no mather what country you in, and a sustainable way to get your food is also kinda nice if it was avalible, and the starving people would also befenfit from having a store like this so they can come and shit and get some food for free.<br /><br />So whats your thought about this?<br /><br />Is this something we could promote in countries where people cant get a job to be able to buy food?<br /><br />Come take a dump and we give you some food or cash since our plantfriends, they love your poop you beautiful starving person thats why they grow&nbsp; &nbsp;food 4 you.<br /><br />Whats the demand to get food? should it not be taking a dump that would pay for our food?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				How high are you right now :P ?<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />In case you are serious and not tripping balls:<br /><br />Human feces carry diseases that are easily transmitted through groundwater and runoff.<br />No fecal matter from any carnivore (dogs and cats) or omnivore (pigs and humans) should be used for fertilizer. Disease transmission is exceptionally high. <br />

				Hahahahahaa and I aint gonna argue with someone who uses opinions from wikipedia believing they are truths..<br /><br />Im not either gonna agrue with someone who thinks 6th grade biology is knowledge and South Park is a fun show.<br /><br />Humanity is not designed as omnivores.. According to the evidences.<br /><br />I aint going to argue with someone who cant see evidences.<br /><br />I dont like believers, beLIEvers often fall for LIES, some are religious believers, some are atheist believers, and wow your corebelifs will get crushed very soon and you will be so lost when it happens. And you will eat other humans when the fun is gone since thats how you will devolve to become a neandertahl. You have no idea that you dont even need food and water to survive.. If you knew what and who you are.<br /><br />&nbsp;Im not going to argue with someone who is braggin about what drugs he have taken and what drugs he will be takin since youre probably 13 years old and you should continue watchin SouthPark instead of reading what I write since this is for grownups who can hadle the truth.<br /><br />Since you CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH!!

				Roger, what you want to do is make a smaller cycle like this:<br /><br />plants -&gt; food -&gt; poop -&gt; plants (and so on)<br /><br />The only problem is, our body takes out a lot of the nutrients to grow muscle/hair/nails/skin/fat so there will be a few things missing in the poop to actually be able to grow a new plant out of it. Luckily our planet earth is a relatively closed system which gets energy from an outside source (the sun) so I dont think we need to do the thing you propose.

				Im just makin a point infront of the misleaded slaves on this planet..<br /><br />The plants and fruits were put here for humanity to eat unlimited of free food.<br /><br />Then the aliens who&nbsp; enslaved humanity came and put fences around the fruits and trees and told humans that they will have to be a slave to be able to get fruits, or starve.<br /><br />They know they will burn for doing that. hahahaha<br /><br />The question is how many of you they are takin with them and burn since you cant handle the truth even if its infront of your face.

The only really vital nutrient that plants need are nitrates, which are only produced in plants by nitrogen-fixing legumes (which is why farmers used to practice crop-rotation) or at least by microbes in their roots, that do feed on the poop... But, as you say, very few nitrates make it through the human digestive tract intact. Horse/cow poop is much better in that respect...<br /><br />

				There was 2 landmasses in the past, Atlantis created by the alien invaders and Lemuria created by humanity..<br /><br />The aliens first created darkpeople, but they was clever like the aliens but also spiritual and they did not wanna be slaves and they left Atlantis to live on Lemuria with nature again instead of being slaves to the aliens.<br /><br />So the aliens created whitecolored people that was less spiritual and dumbed down enough to be slaves to the aliens.<br /><br />Then they gave money to the whites and power so they could use the darkcolored people as slaves since they were less valuble for the slaveowners.<br /><br />And here we are and nothing has changed, youre still dumbed down enough to ignore the destruction of your homeplanet and modern slavery, you think slavemaster care for you since you get slaveprivileges, and knowing how the economy works aint so important to you.<br /><br />Now mother Nature and dauther Earth will burn you , slavery and the slavemasters for what you have done to the planet and humanity.. And its sad that so many slaves stay with master in theese last days since they will go down to when higher powers come to &quot;sort this dilemma out&quot;.<br /><br />Detach from the system or go down with the system is the message from them old original lemurians that is still alive and well today.<br /><br />Only nature will prevail, not slavery.<br /><br />So continue eating animals you fkn dummy but your natural food is the fruits and veggies, you will pay for your ignorance. =(<br />
