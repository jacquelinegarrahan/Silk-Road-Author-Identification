				What kind of information can you folks give me on this, I&#039;m very interested.<br /><br />Secondly, I just saw somewhere that our Milky Way Galaxy is on a collision course with the Andromeda Galaxy, what are your thoughts?&nbsp; I know its billions of years away and I may not ever see it with human eyes, but I would like to get some thoughts on our new hybrid galaxy, Milkymeda!

There are tons of interesting organics in space to do this, although I think most of them are simple alcohols... some nitrogen compounds, too.<br /><br />It is also used to fill the intellectual gap which has not yet been filled by theory and observation: the Universe seems to behave as though it is more dense than we can see.

				Dark matter was an invented concept created to fill gaps in the Big Bang Theory which cosmologists so loved.<br /><br />After dark matter was created as a concept, astronomers later found gravitational anomalies which dark matter might explain. A lot of physicists act like dark matter is a real thing. But at this point, no one really knows.

(Aside: gatorade is fucking poison!)<br /><br />I am immensely curious about astronomy. I like the daydream of colliding galaxies. There&#039;s some good sci-fi about how many alien races exist in our own Milky Way... I think there is some of that in the Ender&#039;s series (not just the buggers)... or that might be something else... Drake or something. No... it was Ender&#039;s Game series, maybe the third book.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#039;m more concerned over antimatter. When are we going to get a gamma ray burst from an antimatter asteroid zipping through the Universe! Beautifully scary shit.

For example 29% of all matter seems to be missing and the gravity produced by the super massive black hole should not be holding the galaxy together the way it is.<br /><br />Me personally, I am sure we are wrong about a lot of things in the universe. From the earth we can see out 46 Billion light years in every direction. That is the size of the visible universe. We know we are not at the center of the universe so we can infer that the universe is larger than we can see. <br /><br />We also believe that the universe is 13.8 Billion years old. A little simple math and the universe is expanding at 3 times the speed of light but that only gets us to the size of the visible universe from the big bang. BTW, the universe can move/expand faster than the speed of light due to the expansion of space-time not being the movement of a single particle.<br /><br />To make a long story shorter, dark matter could be our underestimation of the size of the universe and our lack of understanding of the effects galactic objects have on the curvature of space time.<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Antimatter creates the mirror image of matter. When we develop antimatter antennas, we will see that the space between galaxies is actually replete with antimatter.

Don&#039;t stand with such certainty that the equation is absolute and complete. It fits our current understanding, but like Newton&#039;s deterministic universe, quantum probability threw a monkey wrench into everything.<br /><br />Yes, we produce antimatter, and in moments it is destroyed. That does not defeat the proposal of an electromagnetic spectrum that exists in more than one dimension--the range of frequencies that matter produces.

				Dark matter is not all that hotsy-totsy, what really winds the universe&#039;s clock is dark energy! It composes 74% of the universe in mass equivalent (e=mc2 [how do you write squared?]), compared to 22% for dark matter and 4% for ordinary matter.<br /><br />goblin

				Not only that, but dark energy is what is propelling the universe into an accelerated expansion, as a kind of repellent (anti-gravitational?) energy, a la Einstein&#039;s gravitational constant, what Einstein called his &quot;biggest blunder&quot;, now almost certainly a vindication for the old master.<br /><br />goblin
