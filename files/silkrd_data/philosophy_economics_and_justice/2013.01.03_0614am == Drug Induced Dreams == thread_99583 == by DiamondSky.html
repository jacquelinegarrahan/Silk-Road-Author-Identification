				All right, so here&#039;s the deal, sometimes people on drugs like to ramble. In my experience, sometimes, people on drugs, have the weirdest fucking dreams ever too.<br /><br />I thought to myself, wouldn&#039;t it be dandy to have a place where rambling drug addicts could rant about their lucid dreams?<br /><br />So here it is! The Drug Induced Dream thread. <br /><br />A few rules:<br /><br />DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU NEED TO MINDLESSLY WASTE SOME TIME!<br /><br />Feel free to rip on anyone, especially myself, for any of the insane shit that runs through our head.<br /><br />Make sure to point out grammar errors if that sort of stuff makes you happy just appreciate that dreams are a passing fancy and often need to be documented fast.<br /><br />If you want to, feel free to share any interesting dreams you&#039;ve had.<br /><br />If you can recall what inspired the dream try to make note of it.<br /><br />No need to make shit up unless you really want to, more curious to take a look at where we go to when we are in this head space than to find out the extent of human imagination.<br /><br />&quot;Goodies, Ghosts and Gore&quot;<br /><br />About 1g of MDMA a day or two before the dream<br /><br />So I go to bed and end up renting a room in a GIANT house with a bunch of friends. My sister lives there for some reason, my mom too, but so do a bunch of other people (I&#039;m in my 40&#039;s if that helps put things in perspective). The room I&#039;ve rented is the living room, and I really want to eat cookies and watch TV. The problem is I like eating my cookies alone and there are three TV&#039;s in the room. <br /><br />I&#039;m torn for a while between which of the three TV&#039;s to watch and which combination of cookies to eat. One TV, my sister&#039;s, is a giant super wide screen with about 6 power buttons. The screen is all fractled out, like ten narrow screens were stitched together to provide a wrap around effect. I try to turn it on but know my sister is going to be pissed if I end up watching her TV.<br /><br />I move on to the other TV but it&#039;s a square deal and too far away even though its big. I finally settle on my own TV, a old tube thing stashed close to my couch bed deal. <br /><br />But I have no fucking cookies to eat.<br /><br />For some reason. I know the only thing that is going to make me happy are the cookies my mom used to get me when I was a kid to put in my Christmas stocking, the little animal cracker white frosted with colored sprinkle affairs. At first all I could find were fudge frosted animal cookies. I was very depressed but I tried to cope with it. I looked around for a while and eventually found a mostly empty bag of the right ones, but they were open and I knew they&#039;d be stale, besides there were only a few left.<br /><br />I&#039;m really obsessive about my cookies. I figured I could make do. But somewhere along my journey I came across a previously unknown Christmas treat, these were Santa shaped chocolate frosted cookies with beautifully detailed laser iced details that brought life to each of the cookies. I hadn&#039;t even tried them but I knew they were perfect.<br /><br />The issue I ran into was that the laser etching on some of the cookies was imperfect. On some the eyes were missing and on others the glass of hot coco he was holding hadn&#039;t been filled in. While I knew the missing detail would not affect the flavor, I went through the process of ordering these new cookies from worst to best, satisfying my OCD need to always make the best bite the last.<br /><br />At some point during this process, I noticed that I had moved bedrooms. I was now in a room more similar to the one I had when I was thirteen and my mom had blocked off a section of the living room with a few bookcases and called it &quot;my room&quot;. In the real world it was right next to the kitchen but in this dream it had a soda dispenser and ice machine right in the room so all of the many roommates would come in to use it all the time, forcing me to hide my cookie assortment lest they notice my eating peculiarities. <br /><br />At one point in the dream I took a short nap waiting for everyone to leave but when I woke up I was still in my room only there was someone sitting in a chair whose feet I could see but nothing else. For a minute he sat there before getting up and approaching the bed as my father. <br /><br />Now my father of course died a few years ago and in the dream I knew that but I also knew I couldn&#039;t admit it to him or I would have to surrender to the fact that he couldn&#039;t be there. So instead of talking about life the universe and everything we just made small talk because that was all that was permitted under the rules of this odd exchange. We joked and teased. My father and I were never close but we were always similar enough to get along. <br /><br />At one point we went outside to smoke and I started pressing him a bit more about where he was, how he was and he just started to change into other people. I knew he was fading away from this reality and I tried to hold on, imaging that he was still there but he was gone.<br /><br />I got a little depressed by the exchange and decided to go back to my cookies.<br /><br />Moments after returning to bed one of my roommates, a friend of a friend I barely knew, came in to ask me about the possibility that I might have damaged a small piece of fabric I had never seen before. As we were talking we went back to his master suite, a series of rooms where he, his wife and their young child lived. He was renting out the rest of the house to us so his family could have this nice part of the house to themselves rent free but he was finding the inconvenience of having people around not worth it any more.<br /><br />The small piece of fabric I had supposedly damaged was going to be used along with a dozen others as a decoration on a curtain rod they were erecting to allow for additional privacy. I had no recollection of having had damaged it, suggested they just turn it around so no one could see the small mark on that side and offered to pay to replace the whole thing. My roommate just didn&#039;t think I got it. I only kept talking to him about it because the conversation had moved to the bathroom and his naked wife was in there blow-drying her hair. I like looking at naked girls even in my dreams I guess.<br /><br />Eventually I was getting frustrated with the whole thing and went off to another part of the house to try and take a nap again. Soon though my old buddy Steve came over and wanted to hang out. We went out to the garage where his old Mustang was parked and this guy I didn&#039;t know but was friends with started playing with sticks like we were going to throw spears or fence with them. I saw he had broken the dull round edge of one off though to a fine point before he came charging towards me and so I held mine up and he ran right into his neck with it before falling to the ground.<br /><br />I was worried he was about to die. We put him in the car. I sat in the back seat. Held my hand over his neck and insisted Steve drive us all to the hospital. My nameless friend was choking and hacking. I was terrified. I had never killed anyone before. Steve was really high and didn&#039;t know where the hospital was. I really wanted some cookies which I didn&#039;t bring with me.<br /><br />Eventually I made Steve call 911. I didn&#039;t want this guy to die just because we were all too stoned to figure out where to take him. As the phone was ringing Steve handed it to me. I put it up to my ear as I lifted my hand to inspect the wound and describe the injury. There was a small red dot on my nameless friends neck. He was fine. I hung up the phone and woke up with the lingering thought that Steve and I really needed to get less high when we hung out.<br />

				Marijuana seems to suppress dreaming, but I have remembered a few marijuana-induced dreams, and they were completely unintelligible. I can&#039;t describe them very well, but in one dream I saw nothing but blackness, and my body felt like it was in several places at once within the blackness, and I felt like I was being sucked into a vacuum. I heard voices talking to my various bodies, which I couldn&#039;t see. The voices seemed to be my own voice, but I couldn&#039;t understand anything they were saying. Maybe that&#039;s why marijuana suppresses dreams, because the dreams don&#039;t make any sense.

				Virtually everyone dreams when they sleep, though some do not remember dreams ever.<br /><br />If your friend truly think she does not dream at all, have a sleep study to determine if that actually is the case - that will probably indicate she does dream, but just does not remember the dreams.<br /><br />

				Whenever I take ambien (typically to help me fall asleep after doing meth), I will get weird dreams that exhaust me. I&#039;ll usually wake up a couple times in the middle of the night, knowing that I was dreaming about something out there, but then I&#039;ll forget anything except the feeling of the dream. It&#039;s strange because I am normally very good at recalling dreams and jotting them down but with ambien it&#039;s just...*woomph* hit the bed hard, physically, and then my mind starts running old movie reels--good quality reels but they have no staying power whenever I come to.<br /><br />I like this thread though. I hope it takes off and I&#039;ll try to contribute some if I can remember some (and I&#039;m on something at the time -- which is usually a safe bet). <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Snoopish

				so, i know alcohol doesn&#039;t work with my friend, as she drinks regularly, and not really sure about opiates, but i&#039;d rather not try and get her taking opiates unless i can get some opium we can smoke. i&#039;m not sure if she has smoked DMT before, but i think i&#039;m going to try and get some to smoke with her, as i have a feeling she is ready for it and it may help her unlock her dreams.<br /><br />&nbsp;on another note, i&#039;m going to share a dream that i had on December 24th. i had slept pretty much all day and had 3 main dreams; two of which were my subconscious talking to me, but the third one blew my mind. just to clarify, i did not do any drugs before having this dream.<br />I was at a Beatles concert. all of them were still alive, in their 40s, with long hippie hair. the stage was massively large, at least 200 feet high, a hundred feet wide, with crazy laser visuals and full on moving earth as a part of it. i somehow ended up on stage and was singing a song with them. as the song ends, paul mccartney takes out a sitar and proceeds to play hey jude (it sounded fucking amazing!!!). i turned to john lennon, and asked him what it was like the first time his son heard the song (the song was written for his son while john was getting divorced because of yoko onno). he turned to me, with his back facing the crowd, and said to me, with tears running down his face &quot; in the end, everyone just dies&quot;<br />the rest of the dream doesn&#039;t really matter much, but included super heroes n people i knew asking how i ended up on stage, but it was that part of the dream that really stuck with me, john lennon saying to me, while crying, in the end, everyone just dies . . .

				@anon--dude, drugs or no drugs, that&#039;s a powerful hit right there. I can only begin to imagine how much of an emotional hit that could have been. I think we all have had dreams where things happen dispassionately between you and the dreamworld and how, in other dreams, you are so emotionally invested that you wake up and weep or feel panic or fear clutching your chest or you wake up and feel relief that those things you just went through weren&#039;t real after all...even though the emotional pain was so real just a moment ago.<br /><br />Cheers, brother. I may have to share some of my dreams that have hit me particularly powerful. It sounds like yours was one of those, for sure, drugs are no drugs.<br /><br /><br />Snoopish.

				@Anon--I like your view. That&#039;s kind of how I&#039;d see it. I mean, unless you just want to be nihilistic about it (good on you for not going that route). Sucks about your girl with the no-dreaming. I mean, I remember reading that everyone dreams to some extent during REM, it&#039;s more a matter of if you remember any of it happening, but it&#039;s still interesting to think about, whether simply forgetting or being an anomaly where you simply don&#039;t have them, sleeping so long and just enjoying nothingness until you woke up. I feel I&#039;ve had that happen a few times when I was rather tired. I went to take a nap, so tired I was gone instantly, woke up 6 hours later after my alarm clock betrayed me and I felt disoriented. It was like I could not remember what had brought me to my bed for a long minute. Lost concept of time and space. I feel even if I don&#039;t remember my dreams I usually have a general idea of how long I&#039;ve been asleep most nights. <br /><br />Anyways, I could ramble and ruminate on this kind of stuff at length. <br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Snoopish

				Personally I just can&#039;t wait till they find a drug that lets you consistently experience lucid dreams. I know drugs are super fun when awake but I think it would be pretty awesome if they even perfected a drug that let you close your eyes and control your dreams. I&#039;d say a small portion of my dreams are already pretty lucid but there&#039;s always a fragility about them, like when I was talking to my dead dad in my dream I knew I couldn&#039;t talk about him being dead or I would loose the experience. Would just be awesome if that experience could be unfettered.

I feel like there must be something out there that helps a dreamer towards that direction. I&#039;ve been in a few head shops with herbs that claimed to enhance dreams and such. I looked up some of the herbs online and some herbs, according to websites of likely low veracity, have the potential to &quot;enhance&quot; dreams. Whether or not that equates to increasing the lucidity of dreams is not something I&#039;ve had time to explore. I&#039;d be interested if you find something about this or if anyone else knows a drug or herb that helps in this regard. <br /><br />I find the more detail or immersion that is noticeable in the dream, the more likely I am to wake up feeling...affected somehow but typically for the better. Almost like the dream provided a catharsis of some sort.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Snoopish

				I had my first ever lucid dream after MDMA followed by 2c-b followed by Etizolam (to knock me out after NYE excess..)<br /><br />I was walking up a stone stairway that seemed to be leading nowhere but upwards, it felt like I was climbing up to the sky somehow. My phone started vibrating in my front pocket so I picked it up then noticed it was the phone I had about 10 years ago and suddenly realised I was dreaming. Usually at that point the dream would end but this time it didn&#039;t, I started running up the stairs but they began to disappear, I knew my time was now limited in this state so I jumped off the stairs and started flying at will.<br /><br />As I flew I could feel the dream trying to catch up with me so I started changing the scenery to somehow evade my own unconscious, I created fields at first then a vast sea, in front of me were my creations but behind was a living blackness and it was catching up with me. I ended up in a small Medieval village but the blackness engulfed me and I woke up...<br /><br />

				One time I consumed a rather large amount of opiates for me, and fell into a dream state.&nbsp; :) It was vivid and beautiful. It started off with me looking into a wheat field, with the sun shinning bright orange, giving off blinding rays. One of the rays passed my eyes, blinding me for a second, once it dissipated, this person I liked for over two years was standing there. They grabbed my hand and we started running through the field together. They had the brightest smile on their face, with green mountains behind them, they looked even brighter.&nbsp; &nbsp;:-\ Then I woke up. It was a cool dream though.<br /><br />

				I think I fried my brain pretty good recently (or it&#039;s just a side effect of the Ambien I&#039;ve been taking to crash) but I&#039;ve been getting some pretty good near lucid dreams lately.<br /><br />I have this odd sort of theory about dreams as they relate to consciousness. I think for the most part dreams are just sort of a side effect of the brains NEED to move short term memories to long term ones. When I was a kid I had a very graphical representation of my memory, oddly graphical. Any memory I referenced could be easily visualized as a spiderweb of collected reference points. As an example, a plate of french fries brought to the table would trigger a connection to plates, food, restaurants, tables, ketchup, etc. This particular plate of french fries became a new reference point in this collage of what french fries were for me. The whole thing was like a multi-relational database where each point could be driven back to all of the previous points that established it. So my short term memory was a place holder with a unique identifier of sorts for that experience but by the time it got converted to a long term memory only it&#039;s uniqueness would survive as new information (i.e. at a Denys on New Years Eve with my buddy)&nbsp; and all the rest of the information would be those initial records. <br /><br />So my theory is that dreams are the minds conscience representation of that subconscious process occurring which is why the dreams are often relevant to active recent thought processes but represented through a visual assemblage of old information now being tied into it. In the example above, at some point my brain needs to connect the memory of french fries and all that means to me with the uniqueness of that particular night. That memory&#039;s dream fragment in its conscience visual representation would likely look pretty odd. If we accept the fact that ALL information we store is visual it does become clear that at some point a process like this should take place and dreams seem like a convenient place for that to occur.<br /><br />To put it another way with a different computer metaphor, the active RAM (short term memory) needs to eventually be written to the hard drive (long term memory). The rules for long term memory, if my example above is accurate, is that we only store one unique reference for any given concept. So when this conversion process takes place everything new and unique about those particular french fries is written into long term memory and everything that is consistent with previous french fries is simply joined to that record. After that process is done my memory will allow me to reference New Years and find french fries or french fries as they relate to Deny&#039;s.<br /><br />Anyway, I realize this mostly sounds like drug induced rabble (it likely is!), but just curious if any of you have ever looked at vividly recalled dreams under the guise of this sort of associative factor? Can you actively trace the memories being recorded to the aspects of the dream and the connecting points of their long term storage?<br /><br />In my original dream posting I can see several instances of this. The thing that I find most relevant is the harkening back to those Animal Cracker Cookies which are a powerful and ANCIENT tie into Christmas for me. Those cookies mean Christmas to me and so it makes sense that my holiday memories would need to have that association which thus needs to manifest in a dream.

				I once read on Erowid in the lucid dreaming section about how Vitamin B6 induces dreams.<br />I bought 100mg B6 pills (Pyridoxine HCl) make sure theyre on their own, and not in a complex with the other b vitamins. <br /><br />The body requires B6 to make Serotonin, its good to take before and after MDMA use along with other stuff.<br />but for the purpose of dreaming I took upto 5 pills.<br />It really worked, the first night I had amazing dreams and woke up remembering almost all of it.<br />I even got up to go to have a piss and was still half asleep,- there was a big fuckin&#039; moose asleep on my bathroom floor. <br />I didn&#039;t take any notice, thought it was perfectly normal at the time as I was in a dreamlike state, just wondered where it came from.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been interested in supplements that cause dreaming ever since, theres been a few but I cant really recall atm.<br />Poppy pod tea gave me some mad dreams when I drifted off, like morphing CEVs of dried poppy pods n stuff and more intense stuff i&#039;ve forgotten.<br />Oxycodone has given me mad dreams throughout the night. and the night after taking Acid I had sleep paralysis coupled with anxiety (someone had to wake me up as I was crying out in my sleep, - aw&nbsp; 8))<br />People result long lasting positive dream-enhancing effects from African dream root. not dream herb, the other one which is absolutely crap.<br />there are two types. DMT-nexus is probably a good place to search for info on this, as people experiment with alsorts of things, microdoses of shrooms, acid, mimosa (on its own) daily and are reporting very interesting effects and personality changes.<br /><br />Anyone else tried any other supplements or substances that increases dreams? there are many of them around.<br />It&#039;d be great if you could create a combination supplement especially for lucid dreaming and recall.

				Lucid dreaming is not ssomething at can be reliably caused by any drug. It is mostly a matter of training, which can be succesful if you put in some effort.<br /><br />General recall of dreams (lucid or not) is influenced by drugs. Large doses of benzo&#039;s and/or alcohol will make you forget dreams. This in itself is not a problem though, as long as you enter REM sleep and dream you&#039;ll probably okay even if you rarely remember a dream. Personally i&#039;ve noticed i remember dreams best when i have them at odd moments, such as dozing off in a bus, train or car when fatigued but not under the influence of substances, Sometimes these dreams are lucid, sometimes not.

Both are legal, though galantamine is fairly expensive I think.

				Surely it would be very nice to have a substance that causes your dreams to be lucid, and cause you to remember them too. <br /><br />As far as i know no substance exists that does this reliably however - and i&#039;m sure it would be a big hit if it were to be developed.<br /><br />Lacking such a substance for now, you&#039;ll have to resort to training if you want to explore your dreams (lucid or not) further. Improving dream recollection is certainly possible with some effort rather than substance use. I&#039;m not sure to what degree training that would improve (or deteriorate) your quality of life however.

				With galantamine, some form of training is still required to have lucid dreams whenever you want to. The substance probably increases the likelyhood of success, but also has side effects. It&#039;s use is currently only approved in patients suffering from alzheimers, and the side effects can cause your heart rate to slow down to dangerous (and perhaps fatal) levels. <br /><br />Obviously everyone is free to try whatever substance they wish, but i would recommend serious caution in this case - taking galantamine as a healthy person carries significant health risks, potentially fatal if you are susceptible. You should wonder if having lucid dreams is worth living your life, especially since it is also possible to have them without using this substance.

				after searching &quot;galantamine +dreams&quot; in google and reading about 5 links, i&#039;m sold.<br />i&#039;m also going to buy some form of choline. i tried phosphatidyl choline once, made from soy extracts. it improved my daytime vividness and allowed me to imagine vast landscapes and grid-like formations with my eyes closed. i&#039;ve been told of an even better form of choline.<br />i have choline bitartate but ive never really used it much.<br /><br />suprised to see melatonin mentioned on some of the links because it gives alot of people nightmares.<br />B6 is mentioned alot for improving vividness(worked for me), and it seems B5 is added to some galantamine supplements.<br /><br />i just hope i&#039;m not one of those that get sleep paralysis because its terrifying. not because you can&#039;t move but because it feels like you&#039;re awake and alot of the time theres an evil stranger comming towards you. almost freddy krugar-like.

				Ben that is a very good point, thanks for mentioning. <br />To tell you the truth, lucid dreaming as a skill is I think much more satisfying&nbsp; acquire without having to risk using drugs that could be a little nasty. Things like acetylcholine are fairly innocuous and easy to get, B6 as PizzaBrain mentioned too can help. Thoroughly research Galantamine before you give it a try. <br /><br />If anyone has any questions I&#039;d be happy to answer via PM or in here or whatever - I lucid dream regularly (spontaneous and induced), also out of body/astral meditation type stuff which I feel are related. Peace .

I&#039;d say dream journaling is one of the most important and fundamental aspects of building up dreaming skills. It&#039;s generally the first thing people are taught when they want to build up anything to do with dreaming (vividness, lucidity etc.), because it significantly increases your chance of recalling dreams. Write down whatever you remember,in present tense first person. You&#039;ll find that after some time (usually not very long :) ) that you remember more dreams, sometimes multiple per night, and that they become more vivid.

				Lucid dreams can be fun for sure. I don&#039;t do anything to cause them, but have them once in a while - i suppose most people do. <br /><br />I usually detect that i&#039;m dreaming because something seems impossible, like jumping from 10 meters high without injury or such. Somtimes i can catch the dream and make it lucid, sometimes i wake up. I suppose this happens a number of times where i do not remember it at all when i wake up, but i wouldn&#039;t be willing to take any risky drugs to increase the rate of recollection.

				It&#039;s very unlikely that you do not dream anymore. Chances are you do several times each night, but simply do not recall them in the morning. <br /><br />True inability to dream has been documented to cause very severe psychological symptoms within weeks, and luckily is a very rare phenomenon.

				After a night of heavy ketamine use I had a dream that me and 3 friends were walking along a dirt road, stranded or something. And some people picked us up, and offered us some water. We all drank some and lost control of our bodies. In the dream I was still conscious but unable to move. The people that pick us up then skinned us.. Fucked up I know right... But all I could hear was *tick tick tick* of a box cutter blade coming out. I woke up screaming in a cold sweat, and I realized that a notebook had fallen behind my desk and it made a *tick tick tick* sound as it bounced off the metal vent every time the heating kick on.<br /><br />It was probably the scariest dream I&#039;ve ever had and crappily enough the most vivd and lucid I&#039;ve ever had hands down.

Miso paste is also a great fermented product as the aspergillus flavus fungi turns the soy bean locked-up protein into free amino acids and they synthesise B12 from it.
