				I was poking around YouTube and I saw videos that were talking about something big is going to happen around October. In a nut shell, its about the Department of Homeland Security making preparations by September 27th 2013 mainly in FEMA sector 3. There is also something about the members of the armed forces, are not allowed to take leave between late September-November 5th. Got me thinking, are we going to war with Syria then, a planned collapse of the dollar, false flag, Israel bombing Iran? Am I being paranoid? What do you think? Here&#039;s the link:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocx_j-KUVNA<br />

				Stock market crash, peak oil will make itself felt for the first time, gold will surge uncontrollably, economy will start to fall apart, people will finally start to rebel = military crackdown on populace.<br /><br />Or maybe I just dreamed of Alex Jones...

				This is not an election year so not actually the October Surprise we are used to hearing about in the media.&nbsp; The fall of the dollar has been planned since the Fed start printing money.&nbsp; But no politician wants the house to fall on them so they keep printing more and more money and spending more and more money.&nbsp; No politician is going to change this.&nbsp; Neither republican nor democrat will do a damned thing about cutting spending and at this point we can not afford to cut spending.&nbsp; Sounds horrible if your a tree hugger but to make our national economy sustainable we need to cut taxes and DRILL BABY DRILL.&nbsp; But Yea with 17 trillion in debt and and another 125 trillion in unfunded liabilities over the next 80 years or so plus inflation how anyone could think this is sustainable is beyond me.&nbsp; The benefactors are the people who get government money before anyone knows it been printed.<br /><br />BTW I voted Dem last ticket.&nbsp; OBAMA = BLACK BUSH
