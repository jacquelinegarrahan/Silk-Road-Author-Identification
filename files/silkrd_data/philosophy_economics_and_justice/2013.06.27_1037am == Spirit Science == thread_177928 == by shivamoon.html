				So during december 2012 i basically flipped out on drugs. And there was lots of talk of dimensions and doomsday an astral realms and lots of other bullshit also. And i had a huge episode, took alot of time to recover and was off the drugs for quite a while actually. Anyway, i feel like i grew alot from the entire experience, and it has made me much more clear headed and focused, wary even. I also did yoga for a while, and i do believe in our chakra&#039;s and kundalini,, etc.<br /><br />Recently i found this series called spirit science on youtube. And most of the stuff i heard from friends, random sources on the net during my episode was alot of crap. But some of the stuff here presents it in a new light. And honestly, its quite a positive one. I dont really know what to make of it, so im not saying watch it and love it, rather im asking u watch it and tell me what you feel about it. Here a link, and i would suggest watch it in order, take as long as you need theres no hurry, watch it like a movie. If u skip episodes it definately gets wierd, haha.<br /><br /><br />Warning Clearnet <div class="codeheader">Code: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return smfSelectText(this);" class="codeoperation">[Select]</a></div><code class="bbc_code">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmN2RL4VJsE</code>

				had a very similar kind of reawakening/kick in the ass, around the very same time. went through a huge period of destruction, then realisation. it was indeed a big eye opener. i found yoga too, meditation through that and also somewhere along the line, the spirit science series too!<br />most definitely worth a watch, good background material!<br />could not recommend yoga more highly though, especially if you lead a stressful life like im sure many of us here do!

				Just watched the entire series and I don&#039;t even know where to start!&nbsp; I, like the OP and cher had basically the same experiences and around the same time.&nbsp; My biggest awakening happened without drugs, it was more of a near death experience that opened my eyes up to a completely different world.&nbsp; The spirit science series seemed to confirm most of the thoughts and feelings I have been having.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what to think about the whole Martian thing, but after what I have been through recently, I believe anything is possible.<br /><br />+1 OP<br /><br />I&#039;m more interested now in researching all of this.

				i think there is a movie version with all the episodes put together in order so its easier to follow, dont know if i agree with all of it but its&nbsp; for sure interesting. i usually end up watching stuff like that when i coming down from tripping acid n it makes more sense then lol. good watch if your bored and open minded to that type of stuff.

				I like what I hear, it sounds like your aknowledgin that so much of philosophy and the intelectual is bullshit but that there is some profound truth in spirituality that you found along that same journey. I&#039;m in that rabbit hole my brother of celestial light and as you may have seen (you might know me from films such as : lol) I&#039;ve been contemplating ending my presence here. of course that may not be possible as my ripples continue but might I at least stop making ripples? and is it for the best?&nbsp; even still givin that you approached the subject in that &#039;just so&#039; manner I think id like to check it out.

				sound like the video is speaking about hermeticism without detailing the principles.&nbsp; good luck to anyone traveling this path, it&#039;s a great one to be on.&nbsp; the law of attraction didn&#039;t work until i began imaging and doing as i thought. i flipped out before too -cherish those experiences, it took years before i found understanding, felt like being stuck in another dimension for some space in time,&nbsp; experiencing another lifetime. <br /><br />

I think i have been researching this stuff for pretty long. Almost 2-3 years. But i used to have very rigid idea&#039;s about my spiritual belief&#039;s and on god,etc. Only recently have i started actually implementing these things and thoughts of love in my life, and im honestly seeings changes. So im interested in researching all of this, but im more interested in just implementing it and going with the flow. As someone wise said, the path to spiritual awakening is plagued with irony. Many wierd things happen as soon as you start to believe, it&#039;s difficult to explain, but its like god&#039;s life force is helping u realize that the whole world is just a stage, ur not in control, you just have to go with the flow

				I think conceptually, it&#039;s all a means to an end.<br /><br />Psychoactive drugs and spiritual practices, I have found, bring about akin states of awareness, feeling of oneness and sometimes intuitive understandings.<br /><br />Addictions aside, I personally feel that it&#039;s not about choosing the path of drugs of the path of spirituality, but to rather find the balance between them in order to reap the benefits of both, or at least in a way that serves in the individual&#039;s growth.
