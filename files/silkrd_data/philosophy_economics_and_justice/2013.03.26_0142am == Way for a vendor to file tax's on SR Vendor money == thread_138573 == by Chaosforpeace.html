				How is transferring BTC from one SR account to another &#039;washing&#039;? Utter nonsense.<br /><br />Send them to an exchange, sell for a currency of your choice and withdraw to an anonymous bank account. Withdraw cash and spend it.<br /><br />It really isn&#039;t complicated.

				Right. There are no such things as &quot;anonymous&quot; bank accounts.<br /><br />Does the money appear in your pockets from magic? Do you not pick up cash from somewhere? Where do you live that there aren&#039;t cameras? iPhones? Computers?

				If you are in the USA check out localbitcoins.com&nbsp; &nbsp;. If you are in a semi-big city you should have no trouble selling them tax-free to someone<br /><br />Or buy gold or silver on one of the sites that accept bitcoins. Go sell that gold to a pawnshop.<br /><br />I could go on..<br /><br /><br />EDIT__<br /><br />Wait, i read this wrong. You want to pay taxes on your coins? Like you are trying to go out of your way to do it? Good for you...I guess

Not only do ATMs record that data,&nbsp; but they usually photograph the face of the person withdrawing the cash at that time. There is a hidden camera in the back of most ATMs, you can&#039;t see it.&nbsp; ATMs are connected by modem or similar to the bank&#039;s computer network, they are not at all like the money version of soda dispensing machines, all the heavy lifting re: encrypted communications, database stuff, is done back at HQ.<br /><br />2. Numbered accounts, useful though they are, have far more limitations regarding anonymity than the bitcoin network. It doesn&#039;t matter if you have a numbered account, the intermediary still knows factoids such as how much cash you withdrew, where it was at etc. You&#039;re essentially dependent on a private banker not giving you up in return for a hefty fee. I&#039;m sure this was all the rage in the 70s and 80s, but now we have bitcoin! Swiss bank accounts for the masses! The issue now is we need some manner of abstraction to make bitcoin as better store of value since the exchange rate is as volatile as fuck.<br /><br />3. Not paying tax is an advantage. Unless you have a lot of money, and I do mean &quot;alot&quot;, which you need to launder in order to interact with the traditional economy. Otherwise you should probably convert the excess over your living expenses into literal cash deposits of various currencies squirreled away at different places and/or gold bars to offset inflation. But paying taxes without an ulterior motive is not something I comprehend. I hope you&#039;re not suffering from Stockholm syndrome! :)<br /><br />4. I think you could do this. But the result would be that there will be the Mark of Cain on you for even admitting officially that you gain monies from the bitcoin economy period. SR vendors should ideally, if questioned by people connected to officialdom either claim they know nothing about bitcoin, or claim they have investigated, geeked it out and it&#039;s the dumbest idea since Superbowl tofu dogs. Tell curious people how bitcoin doesn&#039;t measure up to the Platonic ideal or Aristotelian conception of money or something equally dense and they won&#039;t be able to get you to STFU fast enough.<br />

				.....<br />I don&#039;t even know what to say to this thread. If you are trying to pay taxes on your bitcoins, just put them in Mt.Gox, and wire them to your account, and then simply pay taxes. If anyone asks, you purchased bitcoins when they were 1$/peice and are now cashing out.<br /><br />If you&#039;re trying to launder money, do the following:<br /><br />Register an anonymous share bearer corporation in Guatemala.<br />Get a bank account on that corporation with world-wide debit<br />Be ready to pay ATM withdrawl fees OUT YOUR ASS<br />Put all money in guatemalian corporation<br />Guatemala laws state that any offshore derived income to your corporation is taxed at a flat rate of 250$<br />Pay guatemala government 250$/year<br />Never visit guatemala<br />Enjoy money.<br /><br />Simple.<br />Good luck.<br />(How are you still alive?)<br /><br />

You do not need to go through all that rigamaroll just to pay taxes on illegal income. the IRS does not care that you are conducting an illegal business, just as long as you pay your taxes. prostitutes pay taxes, bookies pay taxes. even the fake hitmen on the deepnet pay taxes. look it up. there are some specific tax benefits that an illegal business losses out on compared to a legal business enterprise. But as long as you pay your taxes according to IRS rules, the IRS won&#039;t care that you are a vendor on SR. Your plan entails lying about your true income and expenses. Any lawyer will tell you, never lie to LE. This includes the IRS. Your better off staying silent, than lying. <br /><br />Now, will the DEA look at your tax return as an admission of guilt? There are varying opinions on that. Again you can look that up or speak with a 5th amendment lawyer. But I doubt the DEA even has an intern looking through tax filings trying to find people declaring income as a SR vendor. I doubt anyone at the DEA even knows how to read a proper tax filing. But I guarantee you, the IRS has teams of agents looking for people NOT paying their taxes on legal and illegal income. You need to know what are likely threats to your business. Yes the DEA is a very scary vector of attack. But the IRS vector of attack is much more likely. <br /><br />And before anyone flames me for advising someone to admit to being a drug dealer, you can file taxes on illegal business activities without admitting what type of illegal business activity you are actually involved in. This will protect you from non-IRS LE because they must bring specific charges against criminals. LE must suspect you of committing a specific crime and not just suspect you of generally being a criminal.&nbsp;

				If you want to pay taxes on your drug income because you believe it is your moral obligation to society or whatever, props to you for sticking to your ideals in a highly compromised world. If you want to pay taxes on your drug money to avoid trouble with the law, don&#039;t do it. The worst thing you could do is mention bitcoin on your taxes, because every tax prosecutor thinks BTC is just something people use to launder money and/or trade for illicit drugs.

I claim that I purchased thousands of coins when they were only worth 1$ each. And I pay tax&#039;s on said coins that I claimed I bought legally with cash through bitinstant.<br />Would this work?? How would I possibly be caught?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Do not implement your plan. It will fail. You do not need to go through all that rigamaroll just to pay taxes on illegal income. the IRS does not care that you are conducting an illegal business, just as long as you pay your taxes. prostitutes pay taxes, bookies pay taxes. even the fake hitmen on the deepnet pay taxes. look it up. there are some specific tax benefits that an illegal business losses out on compared to a legal business enterprise. But as long as you pay your taxes according to IRS rules, the IRS won&#039;t care that you are a vendor on SR. Your plan entails lying about your true income and expenses. Any lawyer will tell you, never lie to LE. This includes the IRS. Your better off staying silent, than lying. <br /><br />Now, will the DEA look at your tax return as an admission of guilt? There are varying opinions on that. Again you can look that up or speak with a 5th amendment lawyer. But I doubt the DEA even has an intern looking through tax filings trying to find people declaring income as a SR vendor. I doubt anyone at the DEA even knows how to read a proper tax filing. But I guarantee you, the IRS has teams of agents looking for people NOT paying their taxes on legal and illegal income. You need to know what are likely threats to your business. Yes the DEA is a very scary vector of attack. But the IRS vector of attack is much more likely. <br /><br />And before anyone flames me for advising someone to admit to being a drug dealer, you can file taxes on illegal business activities without admitting what type of illegal business activity you are actually involved in. This will protect you from non-IRS LE because they must bring specific charges against criminals. LE must suspect you of committing a specific crime and not just suspect you of generally being a criminal. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Think of the thousands of state legal cannabis dispensaries paying both state and federal taxes...

				Why would I pay tax&#039;s you ask. Well when someone notices my lamborghini they might just ask how I bought it.
