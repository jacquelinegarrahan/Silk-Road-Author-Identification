				The Great Money Trick<br />&nbsp;<br />(From Robert Tressel&#039;s The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists)<br />&nbsp;<br />“Money is the real cause of poverty,” said Owen.<br />“Prove it,” repeated Philpot.<br />“Money is the cause of poverty because it is the device by which those who are too lazy to work are enabled to rob the workers of the fruits of their labour.”<br />“Prove it,” said Philpot.<br />Owen slowly folded up the piece of newspaper he had been reading and put it in his pocket.<br />“All right,” he replied. “I’ll show you how the Great Money Trick is worked.”<br />Owen opened his dinner basket and took from it two slices of bread, but as these were not sufficient, he requested that anyone who had some bread left should give it to him. They gave him several pieces, which he placed in a heap on a clean piece of paper, and, having borrowed the pocket knives of Easton, Harlow and Philpot, he addressed them, as follows:<br />“These pieces of bread represent the raw materials which exist naturally in and on the earth for the use of mankind; they were not made by any human being, but were created for the benefit and sustenance of all, the same as were the air and the light of the sun.”<br />“Now,” continued Owen, “I am a capitalist; or rather I represent the landlord and capitalist class. That is to say, all these raw materials belong to me. It does not matter for our present argument how I obtained possession of them, the only thing that matters now is the admitted fact that all the raw materials which are necessary for the production of the necessaries of life are now the property of the landlord and capitalist class. I am that class; all these raw materials belong to me.”<br />“Now you three represent the working class. You have nothing, and, for my part, although I have these raw materials, they are of no use to me. What I need is the things that can be made out of these raw materials by work; but I am too lazy to work for me. But first I must explain that I possess something else beside the raw materials. These three knives represent all the machinery of production; the factories, tools, railways, and so forth, without which the necessaries of life cannot be produced in abundance. And these three coins” - taking three half pennies from his pocket - “represent my money, capital.” “But before we go any further,” said Owen, interrupting himself, “it is important to remember that I am not supposed to be merely a capitalist. I represent the whole capitalist class. You are not supposed to be just three workers, you represent the whole working class.”<br />Owen proceeded to cut up one of the slices of bread into a number of little square blocks.<br />“These represent the things which are produced by labour, aided by machinery, from the raw materials. We will suppose that three of these blocks represent a week’s work. We will suppose that a week’s work is worth one pound.”<br />Owen now addressed himself to the working class as represented by Philpot, Harlow and Easton.<br />“You say that you are all in need of employment, and as I am the kind-hearted capitalist class I am going to invest all my money in various industries, so as to give you plenty of work. I shall pay each of you one pound per week, and a week’s work is that you must each produce three of these square blocks. For doing this work you will each receive your wages; the money will be your own, to do as you like with, and the things you produce will of course be mine to do as I like with. You will each take one of these machines and as soon as you have done a week’s work, you shall have your money.”<br />The working classes accordingly set to work, and the capitalist class sat down and watched them. As soon as they had finished, they passed the nine little blocks to Owen, who placed them on a piece of paper by his side and paid the workers their wages.<br />“These blocks represent the necessaries of life. You can’t live without some of these things, but as they belong to me, you will have to buy them from me: my price for these blocks is, one pound each.”<br />As the working classes were in need of the necessaries of life and as they could not eat, drink or wear the useless money, they were compelled to agree to the capitalist’s terms. They each bought back, and at once consumed, one-third of the produce of their labour. The capitalist class also devoured two of the square blocks, and so the net result of the week’s work was that the kind capitalist had consumed two pounds worth of things produced by the labour of others, and reckoning the squares at their market value of one pound each, he had more than doubled his capital, for he still possessed the three pounds in money and in addition four pounds worth of goods. As for the working classes, Philpot, Harlow and Easton, having each consumed the pound’s worth of necessaries they had bought with their wages, they were again in precisely the same condition as when they had started work - they had nothing.<br />This process was repeated several times; for each week’s work the producers were paid their wages. They kept on working and spending all their earnings. The kind-hearted capitalist consumed twice as much as any one of them and his pool of wealth continually increased. In a little while, reckoning the little squares at their market value of one pound each, he was worth about one hundred pounds, and the working classes were still in the same condition as when they began, and were still tearing into their work as if their lives depended on it.<br />After a while the rest of the crowd began to laugh, and their merriment increased when the kind-hearted capitalist, just after having sold a pound’s worth of necessaries to each of his workers, suddenly took their tools, the machinery of production, the knives, away from them, and informed them that owing to over-production all his store-houses were glutted with the necessaries of life, he had decided to close down the works.<br />“Well, and wot the bloody ‘ell are we to do now?” demanded Philpot.<br />“That’s not my business,” replied the kind-hearted capitalist. “I’ve paid your wages, and provided you with plenty of work for a long time past. I have no more work for you to do at the present. Come round again in a few months time and I’ll see what I can do.”<br />“But what about the necessaries of life?” demanded Philpot. “we must have something to eat.”<br />“Of course you must,” replied the capitalist, affably; “and I shall be very pleased to sell you some.”<br />“But we ain’t got no bloody money!”&nbsp; said Philpot<br />“Well, you can’t expect me to give you my goods for nothing! You didn’t work for nothing, you know. I paid you for your work and you should have saved something: you should have been thrifty like me. Look how I have got on by being thrifty!”<br />The unemployed looked blankly at each other, but the rest of the crowd only laughed; and then the three unemployed began to abuse the kind-hearted capitalist, demanding that he should give them some of the necessaries of life that he had piled up in his warehouses, or to be allowed to work and produce some more for their own needs; and even threatened to take some of the things by force if he did not comply with their demands. But the kind-hearted capitalist told them not to be insolent, and spoke to them about honesty, and said if they were not careful he would have their faces battered in for them by the police, or if necessary he would call out the military and have them shot down like dogs, the same as he had done before at Featherstone and Belfast.<br /><br /><br />(The author was a house painter in England before the Great War, unfortunately he died of TB before seeing his book published)<br />

				Yes it is just a trick, isn&#039;t it? I think about this all the time. <br /><br />You ever notice how money is so hard to understand? Its all very counterintuitive. And people who are uneducated about money always seem to make the wrong decisions with it (pay day loans, for example). <br /><br />Well its not like that by accident or pure coincidence. It was deliberately set up to be like that by the people in power. They deliberately want it to be hard to understand so most people wont understand it. Then those in power can keep all the money. <br /><br />Babylon!<br /><br />We should all just go back to the barter system ;D

				I don&#039;t have the time right now to read it all, but it looks like an interesting read and I will read it later.<br /><br />But since it&#039;s about money, I always tell people to go watch the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; movie on youtube. It&#039;s quite a few years old so you maybe already have seen it, but it&#039;s a quite interesting watch if you haven&#039;t seen it yet :)

				Yes, we Pagans and laborers are forever stuck in a cycle of working just so we can barely get by, while the fatcats we work for are steady padding their pockets.&nbsp; This is life my friends.&nbsp; The only real way I see to break the cycle is to save up some money from your laboring and then start your own business and be your own boss.

				Great post, thanks! Money only has power because of its demands. If everybody in this world tomorrow just agree to throw away their money or refuse to accept money for payment and do barter instead, money will be worthless. And people will be doing each other favors. We might not be able to enjoy our basic luxuries (ready-made clothes, fast food, etc) anymore, but we&#039;ll have freedom.

One person cannot manufacture computers in his garage and then trade them for 9 loaves of bread. One person can&#039;t build a car, or refine oil.<br /><br />Going to a barter system would mean reverting to the bronze age, or something like that.<br /><br />I don&#039;t think the concept of money is inherently evil, but you could argue that capitalism and the financial systems are. All money is, at its core, is something that represents value. So instead of trading that computer for 9 loaves of bread, you trade the computer for something that has the same value as the 9 loaves of bread, therefore letting you purchase them.<br /><br />Maybe its going back to trading with gold, something that has a more fixed and tangible value than money.<br /><br />But still, today&#039;s times are too complicated for the barter system. If you want that, go live in a commune somewhere or with a tribe in Africa. <br /><br />Also, good luck trying to buy drugs on the internet by offering to ship your dealer a hand carved pipe.
