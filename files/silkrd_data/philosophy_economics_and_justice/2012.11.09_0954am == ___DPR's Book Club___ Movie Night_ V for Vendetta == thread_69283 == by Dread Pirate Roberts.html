				I hope everyone enjoyed reading and discussing the first part of Lew Rockwell&#039;s The Left, the Right and the State.&nbsp; I&#039;m glad we were able to squeeze it in before the US presidential election and hopefully it gave some of you an alternative perspective before you went to the polls.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to shift gears a bit and have a movie night before we start in on the next reading.&nbsp; A week from today, Friday the 16th, at 8 pm EST, we&#039;ll hit play on&nbsp; James McTeigue&#039;s &quot;V for Vendetta.&quot;<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A shadowy freedom fighter known only as &quot;V&quot; uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society.

So are these messages wronglyu dated or has the problem been going on for 89 days and we&#039;re only noticing it now. Mind you, after 6 days on the first message, DPR messags on the thread that&#039;s angry about mrouid&nbsp; being kicked out&quot; He find time to worry about the state of mr Ouid, while he&#039;s a day away of putting the maintenance&#039; sign on the door. I know mr ouid is not going to sell much regardless... http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67895.msg573369#msg573369 (http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=67895.msg573369#msg573369)&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m really happy I&#039;m not any bigger than i m right now, because i could have been and i could be in a nice mess, peoples livelihoods dpend on this situation, that&#039;s another way to look at it.<br /><br />Anyway, to shut down for maintenaince like that without any notification,if that isn&#039;t bad for your image, what is? i can&#039;t imagine they would go about it like that. Basically in the foirst post its mentioned that they saw this coming, the pending capacity problems. Now this is not facebook or twietter=, hire a couple of smart people tha will come up with som&nbsp; kind of distributed system who the hell knows, but to let it just go offline until you fix it is out of this world.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen this message too, was wondering where it went...<br /><br />wanna hear a nice conspiracy theory?<br /><br />DPR is in jail, SR will never come back and everyone who downloads that movie will get a visit by crazy people in funny costumes with guns. Why? Cus &quot;they&quot; got your IP, cus one can not use torrent-clients through TOR.&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />But the movie is great.<br /><br />I know another great movie, with a nice speech.<br />http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4214593<br /><br />Let&#039;s watch it on Friday 22, March 2013. That&#039;s five days before full moon. What has the moon to do with the movie? Nothing. But Israel likes to attack on full moon +/-5 days. As they did in Sudan on October 24 exactly five days before full moon. And as I see it, it will be the right time.<br />I stop now. Because I fell kind a off-topic. Sorry. But the movie is great.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; :-X

				I have some very pressing security concerns with linking to a torrent file. When you use bittorrent software, your IP address is exposed to all peers using that same Torrent.<br /><br />That provides a very real security risk; LE wouldn&#039;t even need a warrant to get a list of IP addresses. They can simply download that Torrent and scrape the IP address from all the peers.<br /><br />It&#039;s a good movie but I suggest you buy a dvd and pay cash. It&#039;s an old movie so it will be just a few bucks. <br /><br />Don&#039;t touch that torrent file!!!

				Ok so finding this has straight up blown my mind because for some reason out of the blue I decided to watch V for Vendetta tonight and then when I get on this forum I find this thread. Its an amazing movie and I&#039;m glad to find a community of like minded people. I am really happy to find this community full of people who are very similar to me (there are the ignorant idiots but they are generally known an such and disliked by the rest of us) anyway awesome movie and I look forward to SR coming back up and I&#039;d like to say that I have never lost faith in you DPR.

The eventual result is a relatively small subset of users&nbsp; <br /><br />By itself, it may not be incriminating, but in combination with other data it is possible to narrow down the possibilities, sometimes quite dramatically.

				Pine may be a lot of things, but stupid is absolutely not one of them. She has more smarts than most of us on here combined and if she says something is a security risk than you better believe it IS a security risk. While it may not be a risk worth losing sleep over, she is correct that you may want to find another link to download the movie from. At least if your the kind of person who takes your anonymity very seriously and wants to cover 100% of your tracks.

				Pine isn&#039;t saying anything about DPR, she is stating the obvious.<br />Take the torrent file IPs, and correlate the IPs with the IPs of those running TOR.&nbsp; Then take a look at how often that user uses TOR.&nbsp; If they use it all the time, they might be doing something illegal, or they might be a tinfoil hat type.&nbsp; Look at the ones who use TOR occasionally, but regularly, then watch those IPs in the future for more incrimiating evidence.<br />Also, the government can track and prosecute you just for downloading the movie, without even caring about Silk Road, then they have your system as evidence and can find out other things by doing a forensic examination of your system.<br /><br />You might enjoy living under a microscope blindly and feel secure that you think you won&#039;t be found, but you&#039;re fooling yourself if you scoff at legit warnings.&nbsp; DPR probably didn&#039;t think too much when he posted that, being focused on getting the road back up and running, and I&#039;m sure he and others with any brain cells would say, get it wherever.&nbsp; Bargain DVD bin, internet streaming sites, alternative torrents.&nbsp; There are many ways to watch this without resorting to the posted torrent.&nbsp; Use them.<br /><br />Solution, just because something is a risk, and something else is also a risk, does not mean that any of those items is safer than any other.&nbsp; WTF kind of logic is that?&nbsp; SR is a risk, but we have established protocols and techniques to mitigate security risks as much as possible, provided you read the forums and educate yourself.&nbsp; Torrents are a much greater risk than TOR traffic.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t have any actual facts to the contrary or anything beneficial to add, besides offering up information on how little you value your security, don&#039;t harsh on folks warnings about risks.&nbsp; Pine has, and continues to watch out for our newbies, where others say STFU, RTFM.

				lol, I already have the movie on my external hard drive but I&#039;m going to go ahead and download it again from the torrent DPR linked, to any LE that reads this, I&#039;m in Europe, I will be commencing the download at about 22:00 GMT, come and get me. <br /><br />Yeah I like to live dangerously..<br /><br />(Seriously though, you guys aren&#039;t being overly paranoid, you&#039;re being outright stupid)<br /><br />No LE agency in the world is going to do what ProudCannabian suggested, I know that and DPR knows that.

				Just seen this thread for the first time now. Bizarrely, I downloaded V for Vendetta from a piratebay torrent recently. I just had to go upstairs to my other PC to check. Turns out I downloaded it the day after DPR posted, from a different torrent, but still, that&#039;s pretty freaky.<br /><br />Also I then bought the book, which I&#039;ve started and so far it&#039;s looking way more involved and complicated a story than you get in the film.

				I&#039;ve watched it many times. VERY SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />A dark unintended comedic part: Gay but closeted Talk-Show host keeps a Koran - even tho this act alone could get him killed - In REALITY Gays are hung (as in killed and murdered) if they&#039;re found out in countries where the Koranic government rules like Iran and Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; So this scene is a little bit like a Jew who says in 1930s Germany, &quot;I would rather die than give up my copy of Mein Kumf!&quot; ;D<br /><br />Same character explains to Portman that he&#039;s not Muslim, he says, but he finds the poetry moving and the drawings inspirational. I wonder if he means the admonition to kill and subdue all non-believers with the sword, or the drawings showing the Big Mo cutting off 600-900 Jewish heads in the Kariza massacre?&nbsp; <br /><br />Hollywood bimbos making great movies, except I see the V world as portrayed totally UPSIDE-down from a present-day POLITICAL reality: It is the Progressive/Socialist agenda that has the unending thirst for government control and power, all the rules (another 6000 regulations were put in by Obama), all the government influenced/controlled media that twists, covers and runs interference for him as if they&#039;re on his payroll; the alliance between Google and the WH means that govt agencies will have access to every email you ever sent, every download and your websurf-history. 8) They&#039;re after control of the internet, your personal weapons and the &quot;thought-police&quot; - what you think and what you dare - and dont dare - say. 8) Every woman and every man who takes a penis in his mouth has more rights than you do, and if you think these social programs have REALLY and TRULY HELPED the African-American ethnic group, then I guess I shot heroin with blacks and Puerto Ricans in a different ghetto than you did.

				HANDS DOWN MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />I&#039;ve watched it at least 10 times and it ALWAYS moves me so much, fills my heart and soul with overwhelming purpose and inspiration. <br /><br />One of the few times, maybe the only time, when a movie so anti-government was so successful! That alone we must appreciate and be grateful for. In the history of the world, it has not been very common to see the state allow such popular criticism to reach the masses. Even today, I am sure the powers that be have plenty of pull in Hollywood, but this is a message they could not suppress even in the slightest bit. <br /><br />The dystopia that the movie portrays is a very real possibility which is not too far away in our own real future if we don&#039;t prevent it. Governments are growing towards this more and more each year. Unfortunately though, we don&#039;t have a charismatic action-hero revolutionary, who happens to be a master of martial arts, fencing, and explosives to lead us against tyranny.&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes is in the beginning when after V&#039;s crazy introduction speech, Evey asks him, &quot;Are you like a.... crazy person?&quot; and V replies &quot;I&#039;m quite sure they will say so.&quot; That hits so close to home about what it&#039;s like to be a libertarian/an-cap like me. I cannot tell you how many people assume I am mentally disturbed or some degree of crazy, just because I am aware of our enslavement to the state and because I&#039;m not easily brainwashed. Even now I know many of you reading this are already thinking to yourselves that I must be crazy.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />What we all need to hear, is the message V gives on the emergency channel to the whole country. He gets everyone&#039;s attention and explains to them that they, the citizens, are the real ones to blame for allowing the government to take their freedoms. For allowing tyranny to come to power to give them a false sense of security. That is exactly what is happening in the world right now! They brainwash you to trust them to protect you from &quot;terrorists&quot;, and all you have to do in exchange is agree to give them absolute power. As V says in the speech, &quot;But again, truth be told, if you&#039;re looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror. &quot;<br /><br />Another part of this movie I really loved was the messages on the toilet paper from Valerie. The relationship she had with V, even though V never got to say anything back to her, is so moving. That was nothing but pure love for another human being, without any reason or even any knowledge of the person she was writing to. And how V was inspired to go on the entire vendetta, all because of her. The roses he gave to the victims and the shrine in his home, signs of how much he loved her and how all this revenge was to avenge the evil that was done to such a beautiful soul. This always reminds me of how important it is to love our fellow man in every sense of the word. How if we really are to evolve to a voluntary society, we have to have love in our hearts for each other, and eradicate senseless and unjustified hate. <br /><br />To wrap up my little rambling 2 cents about this great movie, I will leave you with what may be my favorite quote from the whole movie, and a personal motto that I have stolen from V and have been trying to incorporate into my own life every day:<br /><br />Evey Hammond: [reads] Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici.<br />V: [translates] By the power of truth, I, while living, have conquered the universe.<br />Evey Hammond: Personal motto?<br />V: From &quot;Faust&quot;.<br />Evey Hammond: That&#039;s about trying to cheat the devil, isn&#039;t it?<br />V: It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				Well said Inigo, and I wud like to comment on how &quot;love&quot; might be defined in a culture like ours. The Fascist/Socialists define it with a welfare check, but is that what you would want for YOUR 15 year-old daughter? Oh I forgot, it&#039;s not gonna be Scarlett Johansen&#039;s daughter gettin pregnant for a weldfare check, only those N-words in th eghetto, right? The raping of the African American with the creation of the ghetto is the result of the Left-wing &quot;love&quot; while the Dems - both black &amp; white pols - climb to power on the broken, incarcirated, drug-addicted backs of the blacks who got tempted to give up on life and get pregnant for the welfare. Political statutory rape of an entire ethnic group, and that group - and the people who say they care for them - goes into denial and licks the hand of their rapists on election day - becoming less like equal citizens and more like dogs whimpering at the door for more. In the &#039;Book-that-we-cannot-mention,&#039; there is a character called Esau, who sells the blessing to Jacob. It&#039;s like the Dems tempt young black girls (legally they&#039;re children) to give up their blessing-of-opportunity in the US for the bowl-of-porridge offered Esau.

				I remember when everybody who didn&#039;t support the Patriot act was siding with the terrorists. The conservative side was completely silent (with honorable exceptions) when Bush shredded the constitution.<br /><br />Now Obama is doing similar things, you hear the right screaming that he is turning the country into the Soviet Union, while all those dissenting voices from the left are suddenly quiet.<br /><br />It seems to me that liberty, privacy and constitutional rights are instruments of both sides when it furthers their agenda, while in reality both don&#039;t really care about it.

				A difference Cool G, is that Bush never abused it (unless you call waterboarding &quot;torture&quot;). I don&#039;t believe his acts after 911 are commensurate with &#039;shredding&#039; the Constitution. This was a new thing, non-uniformed, non-nationalist enemy, and Bush showed restraint and also prevented alot of attacks. Obama has gone WAY further, executive privelege all over the place, they use the IRS, local sheriffs and economic pressure to stalk and mess with active high profile right-wingers, I believe they murdered Andrew Breitbart and that comedian who got under his skin, not to mention Waco, and by a kind of &#039;reverse-murder,&#039; allowed the Bengazi Americans last week to be sacrificed to his Islamo pals; troops in Afganistan to be abandoned and not reinforced and in general urinated in the face of England and Israel, our best allies. This Bush did not do.

				I thought Steven Rae, who plays Finch, did an excellent job. His gradual rising doubt over the rightness of his position is well choreographed. <br />Even with the mask on, you can sense V&#039;s growing emotional conflict with Portman&#039;s character. Portman has that genius that just takes over every scene, and John Hurt was so good you can&#039;t wait for him to be killed.<br />The scene when V kills the female doctor is so well done I think Ive teared up over it a few times.

I agree. Are you a crazy person? Well what is really a crazy person? Just because I don&#039;t think like most other people?<br />This reminded me of a speech that Terence Mckenna did and titled on youtube &quot;Schizophrenic or Shamanic?&quot; (Clearnet link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEglHjd_gUQ). Just saying how society puts these people who are &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; and tells them that they need help or need some &quot;prescriptions&quot;. When in reality they are just in touch with nature more than others. Whether Terence is right or not, I think that the philosophy behind &quot;you think different, so you must be crazy&quot; is wrong. Humans are weird in general lol.<br />I even more so agree with you on your next point of how WE are really the ones allowing others to &quot;control&quot; us.&nbsp; People are always looking for higher-ups or others more powerful than them to straighten things out and bring peace, justice, and liberty to them. But people have to realize that they are the higher-ups and are as powerful as they want to be. Nothing is stopping you from living a life that you want. We are each built with the same two legs. Same two arms. Etc. Even if your dream is put to a halt and worst case sanario you turn up dead trying. You still helped and changed your world you live in. Because others will pick up right where you left off. It really is YOU / US that makes the change.<br />Thanks for those great thoughts.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I really wish I could of watched it with you all but I read the post too late. Thought it was maybe next Friday but I was wrong lol. Wasn&#039;t around to join in. But I have watched the movie at least once or twice before.<br />I&#039;ll gladly get some conversation started though.&nbsp; <br />How about some relations to the use of the postal system in the movie and how we use it on SR? One of the coolest most innovative parts that I found throughout the movie was when V uses the postal system to ship out THOUSANDS of masks. Clearnet link to clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyVCCD9OrbQ<br />We could certainly say that a system like that is utilized on SR (obviously).<br />What if WE could use the postal system in a way that would spread a message like V did with the masks? What would you choose to send out? Simple flyers with words? A representational revolutionary artwork (like the mask)? Maybe some of you would even send a weapon.<br />I don&#039;t even know what I would choose actually. I would feel the need to spread an action rather than just information. I would like to send a message for everyone to meet and simply gather. Once that is done I think the power of people simply meeting and discussing problems can turn into solutions, actions. <br />Just figure I try to make a question we could all discuss amongst each other.<br /><br />Another one of my favorite clips from this movie is when V is surrounded and fights till the death. &quot;WHY WONT YOU DIE!!!!&quot; &quot;IDEAS ARE BULLETPROOF!&quot;<br />Clearnet video clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGGPufySwZ4<br />Great quote used by many.

I cannot tell you how many people assume I am mentally disturbed or some degree of crazy, just because I am aware of our enslavement to the state and because I&#039;m not easily brainwashed. Even now I know many of you reading this are already thinking to yourselves that I must be crazy.&nbsp; ::)<br /><br />What we all need to hear, is the message V gives on the emergency channel to the whole country. He gets everyone&#039;s attention and explains to them that they, the citizens, are the real ones to blame for allowing the government to take their freedoms. For allowing tyranny to come to power to give them a false sense of security. That is exactly what is happening in the world right now! They brainwash you to trust them to protect you from &quot;terrorists&quot;, and all you have to do in exchange is agree to give them absolute power. As V says in the speech, &quot;But again, truth be told, if you&#039;re looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror. &quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> - inigo<br /><br />Wow great points! I agree. Are you a crazy person? Well what is really a crazy person? Just because I don&#039;t think like most other people?<br />This reminded me of a speech that Terence Mckenna did and titled on youtube &quot;Schizophrenic or Shamanic?&quot; (Clearnet link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEglHjd_gUQ). Just saying how society puts these people who are &quot;out of the ordinary&quot; and tells them that they need help or need some &quot;prescriptions&quot;. When in reality they are just in touch with nature more than others. Whether Terence is right or not, I think that the philosophy behind &quot;you think different, so you must be crazy&quot; is wrong. Humans are weird in general lol.<br />I even more so agree with you on your next point of how WE are really the ones allowing others to &quot;control&quot; us.&nbsp; People are always looking for higher-ups or others more powerful than them to straighten things out and bring peace, justice, and liberty to them. But people have to realize that they are the higher-ups and are as powerful as they want to be. Nothing is stopping you from living a life that you want. We are each built with the same two legs. Same two arms. Etc. Even if your dream is put to a halt and worst case sanario you turn up dead trying. You still helped and changed your world you live in. Because others will pick up right where you left off. It really is YOU / US that makes the change.<br />Thanks for those great thoughts.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I really wish I could of watched it with you all but I read the post too late. Thought it was maybe next Friday but I was wrong lol. Wasn&#039;t around to join in. But I have watched the movie at least once or twice before.<br />I&#039;ll gladly get some conversation started though.&nbsp; <br />How about some relations to the use of the postal system in the movie and how we use it on SR? One of the coolest most innovative parts that I found throughout the movie was when V uses the postal system to ship out THOUSANDS of masks. Clearnet link to clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyVCCD9OrbQ<br />We could certainly say that a system like that is utilized on SR (obviously).<br />What if WE could use the postal system in a way that would spread a message like V did with the masks? What would you choose to send out? Simple flyers with words? A representational revolutionary artwork (like the mask)? Maybe some of you would even send a weapon.<br />I don&#039;t even know what I would choose actually. I would feel the need to spread an action rather than just information. I would like to send a message for everyone to meet and simply gather. Once that is done I think the power of people simply meeting and discussing problems can turn into solutions, actions. <br />Just figure I try to make a question we could all discuss amongst each other.<br /><br />Another one of my favorite clips from this movie is when V is surrounded and fights till the death. &quot;WHY WONT YOU DIE!!!!&quot; &quot;IDEAS ARE BULLETPROOF!&quot;<br />Clearnet video clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGGPufySwZ4<br />Great quote used by many.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I never thought about that in that context, I really like where your going with the idea though! How cool would that be if we could use the postal system like that?! I&#039;d probably send everyone a copy of Thomas Paine&#039;s &quot;Common Sense&quot; pamphlet. But the possibilities are endless and there are so many awesome things you could do with that. If a revolution really comes, that would be such a cool stunt to pull off. Even if it were just to everybody in the Washington DC metropolitan area to encourage them all to come out for an all out overthrowing of the federal govt. Sigh, I can dream can&#039;t I?&nbsp; :)

Not only him/her but all of us as well since we are participants of SR. SR is a phenomenal way/idea to give people freedom of choice. Freedom to do what they want with their own bodies, not have to deal with gangs or dangerous people, and you get some of the cleanest, purest products out there here on SR. It&#039;s a dream to us almost. Amazing.<br />I could see &quot;ideas&quot; just like DPRs turn into other major events and outcomes.

				Heroin lover, Im talking about the depiction of homosexuality and Islam in the movie as being the &quot;victim.&quot; You cant watch the movie and deny that, can you? I find it remarkable that the people so portrayed in the movie are in reality quite aggressive: there&#039;s hardly a conflict in the world that&#039;s not Islamic: Bosnia, Fiji, Chechneya, Mideast, Europe, England, 911 and Ft Hood here, I could list forever. The gays are also extremely hostile and aggressive in their beligerant attitude. They can&#039;t stand the light of truth: That for many so-called &quot;gays,&quot; what you have is a male seeking to reflect his dynamism of difficulty; i.e., an urge to be emasculated, controlled, degraded, made submissive or to be the male doing that sexually to another male.&nbsp; This is no male looking for a monogamous relationship. This is an obsessive queer/fairy/limp-wrist who is only free from anxiety when he&#039;s got a penis in his mouth. Sex is like heroin in that case. It&#039;s a temporary &quot;fix&quot; to a problem he doesn&#039;t wish to admit needs fixing.

When u talk of islamic conflicts, how much do u know about them? including Palestine, bosnia, burma, india to name what i know. muslims r being outwardly persecuted wether u get that news on cnn or bbc (government broadcasted channels) is a different story... remember as the movie shows; media is the mass controller of people and a way to communicate whatever message they want on a broad scale<br /><br />then u got 911 the taliban slant on that was to increase awarneess of bosnia n tribulations there. western slant was this ex cia tactician is a boggy man n countries needed to be bombed, families killled&nbsp; n taken over. did they really? did they do anything apart from steal from the countries and then impose democracy?<br /><br />n w the gay ppl talk at the end of the day in all honesty, i dont like seeing gay guys do thier stuff. is that because society (in my day n area) told me over n over its wrong or an innate thing in me that says isnt right. i dunno... but i do know im a dirt dog myself in my own depraved ways. who am i to say oh look at this person they are doing something wrong... u prolly support freedom of speech but then at the same time want to deny these ppl of being able to do what they want behind close doors. what u say about them being fairies and limp wrist. what about (want for a better word) the man in the relationship... like i say i dont like watching what they do but im guessing they dont all come equipped w double ended dildos.... CJ w all due respect u seem quite narrow minded in ur views. i realised when i was like 14 to group ppl together n judge them before u know them is weak as fuck. u should expand a lil, read outside of the hate pdfs u prolly have been reading.<br /><br />on a final note we all know who controls the media and hollywood n as far as i no they&#039;re not big fans of muslims or gays....<br /><br />pease n stay bliss ppl!

From what I know of the story I don&#039;t think he did anything to anyone under the age of 13 so technically he is an ephebephile (attracted to mid-to-late adolescents 14-19 yrs) or a hebephile (attracted to pubescent 11-14 yr olds) instead.<br />I know this seems like splitting hairs but the point is he is mis-labelled as a paedophile as its a more loaded word. People can hate a paedophile but they&#039;d have to stop, think and ask some uncomfortable questions if he was labelled an ephebephile. <br />Most healthy men will find adolescent girls (14-19) attractive. Its evolution, we&#039;ve evolved to be attracted to signs of fertility which show at that age. Some countries even have an age of consent as low as 14 or 12.

From what I know of the story I don&#039;t think he did anything to anyone under the age of 13 so technically he is an ephebephile (attracted to mid-to-late adolescents 14-19 yrs) or a hebephile (attracted to pubescent 11-14 yr olds) instead.<br />I know this seems like splitting hairs but the point is he is mis-labelled as a paedophile as its a more loaded word. People can hate a paedophile but they&#039;d have to stop, think and ask some uncomfortable questions if he was labelled an ephebephile. <br />Most healthy men will find adolescent girls (14-19) attractive. Its evolution, we&#039;ve evolved to be attracted to signs of fertility which show at that age. Some countries even have an age of consent as low as 14 or 12.

I find it remarkable that the people so portrayed in the movie are in reality quite aggressive: there&#039;s hardly a conflict in the world that&#039;s not Islamic: Bosnia, Fiji, Chechneya, Mideast, Europe, England, 911 and Ft Hood here, I could list forever. The gays are also extremely hostile and aggressive in their beligerant attitude. They can&#039;t stand the light of truth: That for many so-called &quot;gays,&quot; what you have is a male seeking to reflect his dynamism of difficulty; i.e., an urge to be emasculated, controlled, degraded, made submissive or to be the male doing that sexually to another male.&nbsp; This is no male looking for a monogamous relationship. This is an obsessive queer/fairy/limp-wrist who is only free from anxiety when he&#039;s got a penis in his mouth. Sex is like heroin in that case. It&#039;s a temporary &quot;fix&quot; to a problem he doesn&#039;t wish to admit needs fixing.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br /><br />Been a while since i saw that movie but I think in essence this movie is about censorship and that the common person just accepts what the government tells them and go along with it. When u talk of islamic conflicts, how much do u know about them? including Palestine, bosnia, burma, india to name what i know. muslims r being outwardly persecuted wether u get that news on cnn or bbc (government broadcasted channels) is a different story... remember as the movie shows; media is the mass controller of people and a way to communicate whatever message they want on a broad scale<br /><br />then u got 911 the taliban slant on that was to increase awarneess of bosnia n tribulations there. western slant was this ex cia tactician is a boggy man n countries needed to be bombed, families killled&nbsp; n taken over. did they really? did they do anything apart from steal from the countries and then impose democracy?<br /><br />n w the gay ppl talk at the end of the day in all honesty, i dont like seeing gay guys do thier stuff. is that because society (in my day n area) told me over n over its wrong or an innate thing in me that says isnt right. i dunno... but i do know im a dirt dog myself in my own depraved ways. who am i to say oh look at this person they are doing something wrong... u prolly support freedom of speech but then at the same time want to deny these ppl of being able to do what they want behind close doors. what u say about them being fairies and limp wrist. what about (want for a better word) the man in the relationship... like i say i dont like watching what they do but im guessing they dont all come equipped w double ended dildos.... CJ w all due respect u seem quite narrow minded in ur views. i realised when i was like 14 to group ppl together n judge them before u know them is weak as fuck. u should expand a lil, read outside of the hate pdfs u prolly have been reading.<br /><br />on a final note we all know who controls the media and hollywood n as far as i no they&#039;re not big fans of muslims or gays....<br /><br />pease n stay bliss ppl!<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Dear ck, it fits that you jump in here without seeing the movie, which you &quot;think&quot; is about censorship. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I suggest you get the DVD :Islam, What the West Should Know,&quot; and perhaps I could suggest this as a DVD for this forum. I have lived in the Mideast for 4 years, and have studied the utter barbaric imperialism of Islam at length. If u think 911 had anuything to do with Israel, Bosnia, etc., Puhleeeeze, your lack of understanding of Islam is legion. The idea that Hollywood is against Gays and Muslims, what films can you point to? You are completely upside down. Every Muslim is portrayed as a victim, every gay is really courageous, sensitive, intelligent and forgiving. Whats not to like, right?<br /><br />As far as homosexuals, it has NOTHING to do with BEING BORN THAT WAY. Traumatic events in the child&#039;s experience embeds a twisting of the roles of masculine/feminine, and my objection to that behavior HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DO &quot;behind closed doors.&quot; It has everything to do with ADOPTION (which for them is like renting a kid), and dominated the minds - and other parts - of our children in school.<br /><br />As far as heroin not being a &quot;fix,&quot; I was addicted to heroin, I shot coke and gave head to strangers through the rush, and you sound like you really havent learned all that much in this life. I don&#039;t deny you your heroin. I think you should be able to buy it legally. To say that its the same as chewing gum, however, simply a choice, well, i respect your RIGHT to choose it, but to deny you&#039;re getting &#039;hooked&#039; and that this will be a mo-fo to get out of is not being realistic.

What kind of revolution do people want?<br /><br />Happy revolution!&nbsp; ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />You&#039;ve raised important points. What if a revolution divides instead of uniting? It reminds me of this russian KGB agent Uri Bezmenov (he&#039;s on youtube) who talks about how 70% of what these secret services do for their governments is aimed at swaying public opinion both nationally and overseas (in order to overthrow governments), a potent form of psychological warfare modelled off of Sun Tzu&#039;s &quot;art of war&quot; tactics of winning over the enemy without direct violence, but through relentless and persistent ideological subversion. The tactic of ideological subversion relies heavily on dividing a nation into a chaotic state of warring sub-revolutions, destroying the cohesion of an entire nation and thus their most powerful weapon of all which is unity. This is why I believe if there is to be a true uprising, it must be completely spiritual, people have to realise that the root of conflict is the evil that is at odds with its co-creating good within the individual man, that the image of the evil man is made in our own image as Carl Jung (the psychiatrist not the poster above me&nbsp; ;D) preached. <br /><br />I must be the odd one out here but.. I for one thought V for Vendetta was OKAY as a generic action movie, but the SUBTEXT man, its all about the subtext.. and I think that&#039;s where Alan Moore is the true scribe of my anarchy-craving heart. If you haven&#039;t read the comic book you definitely owe it to yourself, I don&#039;t even consider the movie when I think of the book, it&#039;s its own definitive experience. <br /><br />Relating back to your post Heroinlover, and to V for Vendetta in general, here is a very nice quote from a dialogue between V and Eve near the end of the book:<br /><br />V: There&#039;s but one floor to go, if you could carry one of these small parcels, I&#039;d be grateful... But take care.<br />Evey: Sure. What&#039;s in them?<br />V: Gelignite.<br />Evey: Gelignite? Oh jesus... V, I&#039;m not helping with any killing, what are you planning to do with it?<br />V: Dispose of it. After all, as you point out, you won&#039;t be needing it. Anarchy wears two faces, both creator and destroyer. Thus destroyers topple empires: make a canvas of clean rubble where creators can then build a better world. Rubble, once achieved, makes further ruins&#039; means irrelevant. Away with our explosives, then! Away with our destroyers! They have no place within our better world. But let us raise a toast to all our bombers, all our bastards, most unlovely and most unforgivable. Let&#039;s drink their health ...then meet with them no more. <br /><br />So, as V points out, I believe that half revolution relies of violence, but after this point, if we do not want society to tumble into something MUCH WORSE, there needs to be some sort of spiritual/artistic/ideological whatever you want to call it seeds planted to unite us in the common feelings and experiences of what it means to be a human being.

				&quot;There isn&#039;t time for fear, for me or anyone.&nbsp; We&#039;ve things to do...&quot;<br /><br />Enjoyed the movie and enjoyed the book even more.<br /><br />One thing one member of the ILF has always wondered, though, is what exactly everyone is going to do at the end after Downing St. is blown to bits and the people are standing around looking hard in their Anonymous masks, lol.&nbsp; So, to piggyback off the points that HeroinLover and DarkPastry have already made: it would seem that, if we are going to create a new society (or perhaps an ancient one, if hunter-gatherer societies were as cool as primitivists tend to paint them), then we need to starting *doing* so now.&nbsp; If the State were to be magically smashed tomorrow, but we haven&#039;t learned anything collectively, we might be doomed to simply re-create it.<br /><br />That&#039;s why things like the Road, workers&#039; co-ops, and, hell, even the Occupy movement, matter so much.&nbsp; They give people a chance to re-imagine their daily lives without the State, without masters, but with their own autonomy and dignity.<br /><br />So Moore&#039;s story is ultimately like Romeo &amp; Juliet: a great love story, but one that doesn&#039;t tell us what to do after we&#039;ve fallen in love: how to maintain the love and fall in love again!

A lot of this now is about damage limitation for those involved, finding scapegoats and avoiding the connections to parliament and government being exposed as well.<br /><br />This story shows a lot of themes covered in V for Vendetta.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve been having this discussion with my girlfriend&nbsp; for weeks now, had no idea there was such a thing as an &#039;ephebephile&#039;, but i had hoped there was a distinction.<br /><br />Another friend of mine came very close to being put on a register for having sex with a 15 yr old girl he met in a nightclub (in the UK btw, 16 is the age of consent) and nearly had his life ruined by being labeled a pedophile after her dad found out and called the police.<br /><br />I think Jimmy Saville was a disturbed, weird and disgusting person, and i have done since i saw the program Louis Theroux did with him, but to label a man who has sex with 15, 14, even perhaps 13 year old girls, the same as one who abuses (and i feel sick even writing this) a 3 or 4 year old is, in my opinion, wrong.<br /><br />I&#039;m just glad i found a word for the distinction, because my friend is a good guy, and to think he would have been labelled the same as some of these fucking freaks that abuse young children is...well....sickening.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.

				I think what jimmy saville did was disgusting.<br />On the flip side of the coin though, did you see that 15 year old girl that teacher ran away to France with?<br />How the fuck can you tell a girls age these days, most of those at that end of the age scale look like they are going out to a fucking night club when they are walking to school.<br />I&#039;m not defending pedophilia, hell no, but you cannot blame a guy for showing a certain interest!
