				Do you worry about what your money is possibly funding?<br /><br />The cocaine trade is notorious for funding dodgy cartels who really fuck over the people actually growing the plant (mind you, the war on drugs fucks them just as much, as they farmers can&#039;t grow anything else)<br /><br />The heroin trade is just as bad.<br /><br />I personally do have a guilty conscience when buy some items off the road but you can never know for sure where your money is going.&nbsp;

				The way I see it is that regardless where you get it from, it all comes from somewhere. More often than you&#039;d think, with certain products, the source can be the same whether you buy from SR or on the street. If you want to partake, you&#039;ve got to accept you may be funding some pretty shady characters and we all accept that to some degree whenever we make a purchase. The only way to be sure of origin and place your mind at ease is to grow/make your own product. Suffice to say, that&#039;s not always an option for some people and so you&#039;ve got to accept the reality of the situation. Sadly, &quot;If you want to make an omelette, you&#039;ve got to be willing to break some eggs&quot;.

				Yeah, I&#039;ve noticed that most bricks of coke on SR all have the same stamp so probably come from the same place.<br /><br />I agree that most money will go to shady characters, but there are shady and then there are downright coldblooded motherfuckers!<br /><br />But I suppose it&#039;s the same as buying diamonds, I&#039;m willing to say that the vast majority of them are still coming from a fucked up African country with a lot of amputee children!

				its not your fault, individuals have a natural right to use drugs imo - its the governments to blame for driving the profits onto a black market and into the hands of now criminals rather than using it to fund aspects of society, like education and medicine, in order to reduce taxes - instead of wasting billions of dollars trying to fight a war that can never be won

				No I don&#039;t worry what my money is funding while buying drugs any more than I worry about the money placed in a collection plate funding child molestation by churches. People do bad things with legitimate money, so why worry about what happens with any of the money spent? I would imagine that when you buy gas, it is possible that a portion of that money goes toward funding terrorist activities against your own country, but we need gas if we want to drive, so we buy it. We don&#039;t HAVE to drive cars, but we choose to just the same as we choose to use drugs.

				The really bad people receiving funding by the drug trade are a product of prohibition, not the users.

				i dont worry about it cus the little man will never win,the moneys end up all going to the same place..when you think really hard about it,you buy weed which funds &quot;criminals&quot; to buy/produce other drugs to make more profit and so on.now we have these big cartels from south america need to export the goods how do they do it?bribes of course no ones gonna try and smuggle hundreds of kilos without having people on the payroll to make sure these kilos go where their going and as the saying goes if the numbers big enough any1 can be bought so at the end of the day...drugs will never be legalized since so many government officals make alot more tax free money threw illegal drugs than they ever will from taxing it.thats my .2btc take from it what yous will,but the only criminals we are funding are the ones who are lying to us everyday and &quot;promising&quot; to win the war on drugs blah blah blah.

				If it doesn&#039;t concern you that your tax dollars are funding drone strikes in Pakistan...<br /><br />In an ideal world production would be decentralized regardless of climate or location, thus reducing the opportunities for monopolization. Synthetics for example (MDMA etc) are difficult to monopolize.<br /><br />We&#039;re getting there. SR is part of that. If you support SR by buying through it, you&#039;re bringing the day closer that vertically integrated horizontally distributed corporations will manage production instead of States and Cartels. Significant amounts of production will still happen in poorer countries, as it should, but there will be less violence since distribution and the financial network are anonymous, which will foster more cooperative and competitive behavior among market participants. Key elements will be building the postal network in the 3rd world and the use of autonomous vehicles.<br /><br />This is not a way forward. This is only way there is. There is no other way. Eventually even LEO will come to that conclusion.

				Yes it does bother me. I don&#039;t like that the money spent on cocaine funds the war that is going on in South America. It also bugs me to no end that the electronics we buy today are made by economic slaves in China. I try to avoid it, but it&#039;s hard because you can&#039;t live without a phone or computer (I&#039;d be missing out on the revolution), and you encounter a lot of smoke and mirrors when you try to find out where a product came from.<br /><br />The harm caused by the drug trade can be stopped easily. However unfortunately many westerners don&#039;t support legalization and are blindly indifferent to the harm it causes in third world countries.

				I struggled with this question in recent years, which was one of the reasons (not the only one) that I quit certain substances. People can justify it any which way, but at the end of the day (only in my opinion) you are always linked, whether physically or energetically etc, to the decisions you make.<br /><br />Likewise, I take a similar stance with other things in my life. I try not to purchase items made by slave labour (which is actually really difficult being that there are between 24 - 40 million slaves in the world right now), I buy organic local products, I trade for things instead of using money, I ride my bike as much as possible and I try to have a good idea about my suppliers, and if I give away any substance&#039;s to friends I make sure they are doing ok and they don&#039;t mess themselves or other people up.<br /><br />But this path isn&#039;t for everyone, and we all have our own feeling on the issues :)

And the tax would have to be insane to match the drug dealers markup for assumed risk.<br />Large companies are far less efficient than smaller ones, they are a really unnatural occurance. The only reason they exist is because the government manipulates the market through regulation to favour large companies. In Hong Kong, which is the free-est country economically speaking, small business is king.<br />There&#039;s PLENTY of land, the majority of the world is empty. If it&#039;s sitting there doing nothing and you can find a good use for it, you should use it.
