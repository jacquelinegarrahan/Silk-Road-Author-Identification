				Last night was very interesting. The whole evening through the night I had been packing bowls in my new bubbler, while reading Eckhart Tolle&#039;s &quot;The Power of Now&quot; and watching some South Park in between bowls/reading. I didn&#039;t stop reading until I really started to doze off... and as I felt myself dozing off, I felt great pleasure and joy. It certainly felt real, like a moment of satori. I woke myself up, and within minutes I was back to myself, slightly refreshed, but still tired. It&#039;s funny, because moments before I dozed off, I was practicing some of the methods of feeling present and connected to your inner body, and the feeling is similar... it&#039;s just that when sleep comes into play, it makes it more intense, more there.<br /><br />Finally, the dream came. I&#039;m not sure if you can even call it that. There was only blackness, and I felt communication between a person named Jake, which might be related to one of my close friends. I was communicating with this entity about the knowledge of enlightenment, and how the egoistic mind works. It wasn&#039;t a person, and neither was I. It just there. The words weren&#039;t just words, they were being felt. I could almost see the words, but at the same time, I couldn&#039;t. I couldn&#039;t hear anything either. It was just pure communication.<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t want to make it anything more than it is: a dream. So I&#039;m wondering, is it in anyway related to not falling into REM sleep due to being so booted outta my mind? 8) I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s even true, not being able to fall into REM sleep due to being high, but I hear rumors about that a lot. Later that night, my dreams started to change, still kind of related to enlightenment, but mixed with a few mind lurking thoughts. Or is it more than that, but not more than a dream? Just a unique experience? In my opinion, yes, it was a dream, but it was still an experience that felt profound... and what&#039;s so different from profound experiences in this reality we live in?

				I had a dream experience involving that book too....<br /><br />One night, I was dreaming that I was very tired in a bed in my room. The room was wobbly and people were calling my name, but I was just too sleepy and started to fall asleep in my dream! Right as I did, my whole body was awakened by an electric shock feeling that seemed like it came through the window and the first thought that ran through my head was, &quot;This is what if feels like to die!&quot; I woke up in bed and walked around for a little while shaken by the experience. Later, I picked up E.T.&#039;s book and read about a similar experience that he had. <br /><br />I write down my dreams when I can remember to. I have dreamed about events yet to pass and strange imaginary lands. Sub-c0nsciousness is the playful boundary between awake awareness and deep sleep no awareness of just &quot;being,&quot; I guess.<br /><br />Cheers to the dreamers.
