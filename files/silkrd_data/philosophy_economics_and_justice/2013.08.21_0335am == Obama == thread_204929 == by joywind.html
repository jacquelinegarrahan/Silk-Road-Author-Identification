				Whether he&#039;s what the OP says or not, I don&#039;t care about.<br /><br />I do care, that he is not an American Citizen, which has been proven, by people who&#039;ve been threatened by Obama&#039;s KGB like goon squad. <br /><br />Obama&#039;s brother has already been linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. For those of you who don&#039;t know, the Muslim Brotherhood, is like the 2013 version of the Nazi&#039;s- Only difference being is the Muslims have been more successful, and have corrupted most world leaders and media outlets to go along with &quot;the program&quot;. How they&#039;ve done it, is a mystery. Though when you think that most of the people NOW in power, be it Govt or Media, which is actually one in the same. Are the types to not have families, where they care about their children&#039;s future, and probably came from broken dysfunctional communist hippie homes. Much like Obama himself. <br /><br />It&#039;s also obvious he hates whites. I&#039;d use the term racist, but the average idiot who voted for Obama, thinks &#039;racist&#039; only applies to whites who hate blacks. - Thanks to Obama&#039;s minions in the mainstream media. <br /><br />Remember the Tray Von Martin case? - That whole fiasco would not even have made National News, if a white kid were shot by a black man. Then you had the good old 60&#039;s stale radical leftovers like Al Sharpton,&nbsp; Jesse Jackson, and yes, Obama. - Anyone from the US remember that week when you couldn&#039;t avoid hearing about the riots Al Sharpton was inciting-using MSNBC one of the biggest anti-American Networks?<br /><br />Well, it failed. Thank God the majority of younger black Americans saw through this old race baiting game these crooks have been perpetrating since the 60&#039;s. - Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and Obama, should all be charged with attempting to incite a riot. With Obama, that would be on page 10 of the rap sheet I could write up for you.<br />&nbsp;<br />Even Obama was written into the script. No doubt written by one of the wonderful communists in Hollywood, whose grandparents came here to escape the horrors of Communism, yet ironically, the communist attitude didn&#039;t leave all of them. <br /><br />So Obama&#039;s buddies in Hollywood, put out a movie that weekend and it Bombed, big time. - It was called &quot;Scare Whitey&quot;<br />The fact that the largest crowd to turn out was less than 200, even though they chose key cities, by demographics to get the most ignorant inner city types, riled up, and made sure it was timed for the middle of a heat wave, because you know, those riots get much better with the heat<br /><br />Now we have multiple stories of violence against whites committed by blacks, who they even have proof of them doing it specifically for the race of the victim. But the rats in the media are silent. The White House? -&quot;We&#039;re unfamiliar with the incident&quot;<br /><br />Well here&#039;s the story for those of you who only watch the Obama controlled news. <br />Oklahoma Shooter Bragged About Knocking Out “Peckerwoods”<br /><br />The pussy press and police pushed a ridiculous motive as &quot;Boredom&quot; - and no one questioned it! Thank God we still have a few news sources not afraid to call a spade a spade. - pun fucking intended!<br /><br />&quot;90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM.&quot; Edwards tweeted in April.<br />Here&#039;s the article. Check out these &quot;bored teens&quot; They resemble something squishy I had to scrape off my shoe the other day, but they look smellier. In fact, I&#039;ve been around similar human mistakes. They fucking smell like piss usually. <br /><br />http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/before_desire_randomly_gunned_down_cobTERl2NS4xY4RImbjfHL<br /><br />OR! - How about the poor 89 yr old WHITE man, who survived being wounded in Okinawa, defending basically all of us. <br />Beaten to death by two BIG BLACK GUYS. - Who the pussy media refer to as &quot;two teens&quot;. Thank God for video surveillance. They look to me, like if I were passing through a bad neighborhood, I&#039;d probably see similar looking &quot;teens&quot;, and I&#039;d be sure to hit the &#039;power lock&#039; button. Also be ready to blow the red light if they approach the car. Trust me- the ticket&#039;s worth it. <br /><br />Us American whites really have bent over backwards to be nice to blacks, but they don&#039;t really seem to care.&nbsp; They see kindness as weakness. <br /><br />Obama and the rest of his Black Chicago gang, most of whom couldn&#039;t pass a backround check, to get into the Secret Service, or FBI. Are obviously anti-white. <br /><br />Yet now, they command these forces. <br /><br />Oh here&#039;s the story about the poor little old man beaten by these gorillas. <br /><br />http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/elderly-man-dies-after-being-attacked-outside-ice-arena/-/101214/21574858/-/9flm7iz/-/index.html <br /><br />I could go on, but you get the idea.<br /><br />When are we going to wake up?<br /><br />How do you Aussies feel about the fact that there&#039;s been no comment from Obama, nor his illiterate attorney general Eric Holder?<br /><br />Well since nothing has been said, I will say something, as I&#039;m part of the opposition to this illegitimate government now in power. <br /><br />Due to the fact that the United States has been taken over by illegitimate corrupt forces, I would like to extend my sorrow, to the Australian People, regarding one of your fine young countrymen, Christopher Lane, who&#039;s life was taken away, in a senseless act of racial violence against whites, I assure you, as a member of the government who will restore order in these once great United States,&nbsp; that the perpetrators will be dealt with swiftly, and justly. <br /><br />Our prayers go out to Christopher Lane&#039;s family and friends, and to all Australians, who&#039;ve always been our allies. <br /><br /><br />THAT IS WHAT A REAL AMERICAN PRESIDENT WOULD SAY AND DO !! <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry. There are still many of us who belong to organizations, that aren&#039;t going to sit still for this much longer. <br />They&#039;re pushing these stories to try and provoke us out into the open. Fortunately, many of our elders, are actually former FBI-CIA-NSA, SEALS etc. <br />So there is still very much hope. Though it would be a lot better if the majority of Americans who all seem to be drugged up, stupid, or both, would finally realize what&#039;s going on. Unfortunately, they will perish, and we can&#039;t help them.<br /><br />The USA once respected around the world, will be back, I promise you. There will be a lot of bloodshed, that&#039;s the way these things have to happen unfortunately. A new revolution is happening. You&#039;re either with the real Americans, of all colors, and backrounds, or you&#039;re with the phonies who for too long, have claimed to be a friend of the minority, and underprivileged. Yet if you research the data. The minorities, especially blacks, are doing MUCH worse under Obama, than the early 1970&#039;s! <br /><br />God Bless America - We&#039;re going to bring her back!

It&#039;s funny that no one mentions the fact that he was raised by his white mother from Kansas, if anything he would hate black people since his dad walked out on them. However, I do agree with you that there is a double standard in the media when it comes to race. <br /><br />What period are you referring to when the USA was respected around the world? Was it when Bush invaded Iraq under the lie that there were weapons of mass destruction to be found there? Was it when Nixon declared a global war on drugs or during the Iran-Contra scandal in the Reagan years?<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, Obama is FAR from perfect, but it makes me sick to hear so much misinformation.

				Yea I voted for Obama because as Americans we are not given a choice.&nbsp; I believe in the Marxian statement that every few years the repressed get together with the chance to vote and choose their oppressors.&nbsp; Or something like that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Obama is the whitest guy I know and he does border on socialist.&nbsp; We are not a purely capitalist country and we are not a purely socialist country.&nbsp; We have a mixed economy.&nbsp; So Obama is mixed... In more than one way.&nbsp; I have socialist tendencies myself and would like to see America institute a National Health Service and not a law that pads the pockets of both the insurance companies and the federal government.&nbsp; <br /><br />WHAT HAPPENED TO A GOVERNMENT PROTECTING ITS PEOPLE?&nbsp; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CONSTITUTION?&nbsp; IT IS NOT AN ORGANIC DOCUMENT AND DOES NOT CHANGE WITH THE FUCKING TIMES.&nbsp; IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT PASS AND RATIFY AN ADMENDMENT AS PER THE FUCKING LAW.&nbsp; HASNT BEEN DONE IN ABOUT 20 YEARS.<br /><br />Oh yeah and you do not have to be born in the USA to become president.&nbsp; Although I believe that should be a requirement, the only requirement is that you are a naturalized citizen.<br /><br />

				I came to this thread just to say this. Obama is not a man of his word and therefore I cant respect him. Hasnt kept his word about one damn thing that I can think of besides healthcare. I could care less that hes black or muslim, motherfucker is killing people with drone strikes and raiding medical dispensaries ?? Hope and Change is what he promised but he certainly could not deliver. <br /><br />The biggest hypocrisy is how we will honor MLK over and over again for his courage and wisdom and then turn around and bomb the shit out of Syria because they bombed their people. Then again the FBI sent death threats to MLK in the sixties so that should pretty much tell you the state of things in this nation. <br />Rich white privileged folks are running this nation into the ground. They havent learned shit from their own history and everything is a fucking racket, a business. From the police state and the war on drugs to the so called war on terror which has made us all sacrifice our damn liberties for so called safety. You are more likely to get shot by a cop than by a terrorist. Fuck these govt goons, they are the problem.<br />&nbsp;But I refuse to act like them, violently, hastily. Non violence can be extremely powerful if used in the right way.

				There&#039;s a lot wrong with the guy, being a war criminal and a childkiller and whatnot, but he has a tough job, and he&#039;s not the sole mind and body of the united states. A lot of the horrible shit that&#039;s happened was outside of his control, because our government is made up of many organizations each with their own way of thinking. Whatever you may think or believe of the man, you have to admit he plays the game well. He hasn&#039;t been assassinated or seriously injured, he didn&#039;t choke on a pretzel or get caught having his dick sucked by an intern. He won&#039;t be able to do everything he wants to do thanks to the GOP, but goddamn, the man made an impact! I just hope he gets us out of war before his term is up. I&#039;m sick of my taxes paying for war when they should be spent restructuring the homeland so we can survive this fucked up planet we&#039;re slowly creating.

Or are our bombs so smart to just kill the evil guys? - Hmmm. <br /><br />This is all about a gas line that crosses the border into Russia. <br /><br />Obama as usual is supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. A terrorist organization.<br /><br />Enjoy the end of days

For those of you who don&#039;t know, the Muslim Brotherhood, is like the 2013 version of the Nazi&#039;s- Only difference being is the Muslims have been more successful, and have corrupted most world leaders and media outlets to go along with &quot;the program&quot;. How they&#039;ve done it, is a mystery. Though when you think that most of the people NOW in power, be it Govt or Media, which is actually one in the same. Are the types to not have families, where they care about their children&#039;s future, and probably came from broken dysfunctional communist hippie homes. Much like Obama himself. <br /><br />It&#039;s also obvious he hates whites. I&#039;d use the term racist, but the average idiot who voted for Obama, thinks &#039;racist&#039; only applies to whites who hate blacks. - Thanks to Obama&#039;s minions in the mainstream media. <br /><br />Remember the Tray Von Martin case? - That whole fiasco would not even have made National News, if a white kid were shot by a black man. Then you had the good old 60&#039;s stale radical leftovers like Al Sharpton,&nbsp; Jesse Jackson, and yes, Obama. - Anyone from the US remember that week when you couldn&#039;t avoid hearing about the riots Al Sharpton was inciting-using MSNBC one of the biggest anti-American Networks?<br /><br />Well, it failed. Thank God the majority of younger black Americans saw through this old race baiting game these crooks have been perpetrating since the 60&#039;s. - Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and Obama, should all be charged with attempting to incite a riot. With Obama, that would be on page 10 of the rap sheet I could write up for you.<br />&nbsp;<br />Even Obama was written into the script. No doubt written by one of the wonderful communists in Hollywood, whose grandparents came here to escape the horrors of Communism, yet ironically, the communist attitude didn&#039;t leave all of them. <br /><br />So Obama&#039;s buddies in Hollywood, put out a movie that weekend and it Bombed, big time. - It was called &quot;Scare Whitey&quot;<br />The fact that the largest crowd to turn out was less than 200, even though they chose key cities, by demographics to get the most ignorant inner city types, riled up, and made sure it was timed for the middle of a heat wave, because you know, those riots get much better with the heat<br /><br />Now we have multiple stories of violence against whites committed by blacks, who they even have proof of them doing it specifically for the race of the victim. But the rats in the media are silent. The White House? -&quot;We&#039;re unfamiliar with the incident&quot;<br /><br />Well here&#039;s the story for those of you who only watch the Obama controlled news. <br />Oklahoma Shooter Bragged About Knocking Out “Peckerwoods”<br /><br />The pussy press and police pushed a ridiculous motive as &quot;Boredom&quot; - and no one questioned it! Thank God we still have a few news sources not afraid to call a spade a spade. - pun fucking intended!<br /><br />&quot;90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM.&quot; Edwards tweeted in April.<br />Here&#039;s the article. Check out these &quot;bored teens&quot; They resemble something squishy I had to scrape off my shoe the other day, but they look smellier. In fact, I&#039;ve been around similar human mistakes. They fucking smell like piss usually. <br /><br />http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/before_desire_randomly_gunned_down_cobTERl2NS4xY4RImbjfHL<br /><br />OR! - How about the poor 89 yr old WHITE man, who survived being wounded in Okinawa, defending basically all of us. <br />Beaten to death by two BIG BLACK GUYS. - Who the pussy media refer to as &quot;two teens&quot;. Thank God for video surveillance. They look to me, like if I were passing through a bad neighborhood, I&#039;d probably see similar looking &quot;teens&quot;, and I&#039;d be sure to hit the &#039;power lock&#039; button. Also be ready to blow the red light if they approach the car. Trust me- the ticket&#039;s worth it. <br /><br />Us American whites really have bent over backwards to be nice to blacks, but they don&#039;t really seem to care.&nbsp; They see kindness as weakness. <br /><br />Obama and the rest of his Black Chicago gang, most of whom couldn&#039;t pass a backround check, to get into the Secret Service, or FBI. Are obviously anti-white. <br /><br />Yet now, they command these forces. <br /><br />Oh here&#039;s the story about the poor little old man beaten by these gorillas. <br /><br />http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/elderly-man-dies-after-being-attacked-outside-ice-arena/-/101214/21574858/-/9flm7iz/-/index.html <br /><br />I could go on, but you get the idea.<br /><br />When are we going to wake up?<br /><br />How do you Aussies feel about the fact that there&#039;s been no comment from Obama, nor his illiterate attorney general Eric Holder?<br /><br />Well since nothing has been said, I will say something, as I&#039;m part of the opposition to this illegitimate government now in power. <br /><br />Due to the fact that the United States has been taken over by illegitimate corrupt forces, I would like to extend my sorrow, to the Australian People, regarding one of your fine young countrymen, Christopher Lane, who&#039;s life was taken away, in a senseless act of racial violence against whites, I assure you, as a member of the government who will restore order in these once great United States,&nbsp; that the perpetrators will be dealt with swiftly, and justly. <br /><br />Our prayers go out to Christopher Lane&#039;s family and friends, and to all Australians, who&#039;ve always been our allies. <br /><br /><br />THAT IS WHAT A REAL AMERICAN PRESIDENT WOULD SAY AND DO !! <br /><br />Don&#039;t worry. There are still many of us who belong to organizations, that aren&#039;t going to sit still for this much longer. <br />They&#039;re pushing these stories to try and provoke us out into the open. Fortunately, many of our elders, are actually former FBI-CIA-NSA, SEALS etc. <br />So there is still very much hope. Though it would be a lot better if the majority of Americans who all seem to be drugged up, stupid, or both, would finally realize what&#039;s going on. Unfortunately, they will perish, and we can&#039;t help them.<br /><br />The USA once respected around the world, will be back, I promise you. There will be a lot of bloodshed, that&#039;s the way these things have to happen unfortunately. A new revolution is happening. You&#039;re either with the real Americans, of all colors, and backrounds, or you&#039;re with the phonies who for too long, have claimed to be a friend of the minority, and underprivileged. Yet if you research the data. The minorities, especially blacks, are doing MUCH worse under Obama, than the early 1970&#039;s! <br /><br />God Bless America - We&#039;re going to bring her back!<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> Outstanding post 5/5 !! Chip I adore your passion, what a great voice you would be in struggle of ours. What about when Trump offered him a cool million to produce his birth certificate.<br />He certainly had the goons put pressure on Don, and he&#039;s a tough guy himself. You can see his grey hair, christ he has aged, he knows he&#039;s a whisker away from Joining JFK and MLK, of course they could put it down to a disgruntled Right winger, why not? who knows with the crazy people really pulling the strings.
