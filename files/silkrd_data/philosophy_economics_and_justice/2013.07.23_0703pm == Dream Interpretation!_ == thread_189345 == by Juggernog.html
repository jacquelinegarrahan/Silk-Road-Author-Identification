				Title: <strong>Dream Interpretation!?</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				Let me start off with; I RARELY wake up from a dream, let alone even remember dreaming.<br />I am told that we all dream every night, just don&#039;t even recall it even before we awake.<br />I am in my late 20&#039;s and can only recall 5-6 extremely VIVID dreams in that time.<br /><br />So it has been 3 hours since I woke up, and this dream is STILL rushing through my mind.<br /><br />Does anyone else feel like the really vivid dreams have some meaning to them?<br />The dreams I do remember have always been so intense and full of information, that I would have to re-play it in my head as soon as I open my eyes to &quot;analyze&quot;<br /><br />I have to say though, last nights dream was the most information filled dream I have EVER had.<br />under the influence of NO drugs whatsoever. NONE not even my usual benzos.<br /><br />So much happened, but yet all the scenes played together which made it seem even more REAL.<br /><br />I&#039;m so stuck on this and what could it all possibly mean. I&#039;ve been clearnet searching for some possible interpretations of some of the highlighted parts of the dream. (I do have it available to post if anyone is interested (my dream)))&nbsp; It is still confusing though.

				Quite a few years ago I had a series of the most bizarre dreams I have ever had; it&#039;s unfortunate that many or the majority of them (although I hope not all) were the direct result of SSRIs I was taking then. I mean bizarre in the sense of pure unaldulterated out of this world imagery.<br /><br />But the most important dreams (the most influential, life-changing and life-affirming) dreams I have had were not the result of any mind-altering substances. I include here a true case of lucid dream, the only one so far that I have had. It was truly wonderful.<br /><br />I had another that I would classify as semi-lucid, because I just don&#039;t know if I was really conscious of it being a dream at the time.<br /><br />&quot;We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.&quot; W.

				for me there are 2 ways to look at the dream: old school superstitious way, just whatever the dream is it has some preset meaning, described in some dream dictionary.<br /><br />another way is sort of scientific, how your brain deals with the issues,&nbsp; some dreams will correspond with some issues as symbols, Freud was big on that.<br /><br />try to figure out how the dream makes you feel, what any of this means to you personally etc., reminds you of something, maybe an opposite thing has a meaning, use the intuition.<br /><br />the more you pay attention to it, the better you&#039;ll get in figuring out the dreams, it&#039;s a good thing, there&#039;s often a message to ourselves
