				The fact that its a crime to use drugs is the biggest bullshit ever. Especially in a country like the U.S., that champions freedom. How can you call it a &quot;free country&quot; when personal freedom is nonexistent? <br /><br />The crime of using drugs is a victimless one. No one gets hurt, except in a small minority of cases, the user themselves. How is this different from hurting yourself by, lets say, eating too many Big Macs? In a true free society, people should be allowed to choose freely, even if they are making poor decisions.<br /><br />Of course, alcohol, which is actually more dangerous than a lot if illegal <br />drugs, is perfectly legal and is encouraged in our society. I was pulled over by a cop one time at a drunk driver checkpoint. He asked me if I had been drinking, and when I replied &quot;I dont drink&quot;, he asked &quot;Why not? What&#039;s wrong with you?&quot;. <br /><br />As the great Peter Tosh once said, Legalize it, and I will advertize it!

				The war on drugs has been proved not to be successful. Now it&#039;s time to change the strategy, and to focus on drug education instead on prohibition.<br />This way will be a lot less of crimes, corruption and the drugs will be better.
