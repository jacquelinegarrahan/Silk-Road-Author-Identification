				R.U. Sirius (from the bygone era of cyberdelia) has written a thoughtful article entitled &quot;Cypherpunk rising: WikiLeaks, encryption, and the coming surveillance dystopia&quot;; it is available here: http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/7/4036040/cypherpunks-julian-assange-wikileaks-encryption-surveillance-dystopia.<br /><br />Sirius covers a wide breadth of cyberpunk/crypto-anarchist history: the enthusiasm that fueled the 90&#039;s, the easily-predictable government attempts at suppression (e.g., Clipper), and current theorizing from Julian Assange among others.<br /><br />One thought I found especially disquieting, &quot;Assuming that some degree of privacy is still possible, most people don’t seem to think it’s worth the effort. The cypherpunks and their ilk fought to keep things like the PGP encryption program legal — and we don’t use them. We know Facebook and Google leak our personal online habits like a sieve and we don’t make much effort to cover our tracks.&quot;<br /><br />This widespread indifference toward using cryptography is one of the first hurdles to overcome. There is no need to proselytize about one&#039;s pet political philosophy; rather, we should simply advocate the adoption of cryptographic software. All cypherpunks now should be ideological only insofar as cryptography is.&nbsp; &quot;Have you heard about Tor browser?&quot; is a question that can breed more users, thereby ushering in more people that have a growing familiarity with encryption, a greater desire for anonymity, a sense of their rapidly-vanishing privacy. <br /><br />Make cryptography fashionable. That&#039;s our mission, first and foremost. <br /><br />

Is it laziness? Do people not care enough? Are the drug-like pleasures of facebook so strong that people don&#039;t care about liberty as long as they can play farmville...?<br /><br />I think I digress/rant.<br /><br />Cheers for the link +1

				Cypher Punk rising...<br /><br />For one, any title that includes punk in it makes me think of a douche bag. Douche bag. Kim Kardashian or Kanye West might describe a style as &quot;punk&quot;, and that&#039;s where I leave it.<br /><br />Anyway, this thread is as boring as they come. Yes, privacy has always been an issue. Early tribes of humans didn&#039;t have many secrets; if it had been otherwise, then the tribes would have all starved to death. Modern times have loaned privacy from tribes in exchange for societies. Privacy, whether cryptographic or closed doors, has always been at risk. If you are a home owner, then living in a nice neighborhood will grant you more privacy, more security. Living in the hood, there is less discretion--less privacy.<br /><br />Ever since Alexander Graham Bell, the game changed, but not by much. Ma Bell, AOL, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast, Century Link, Vonage, etc. These are eunuchs that serve the interests CEOs and elected officials, a far cry from democracy. When people sign communications contracts with public companies, enabling strangers to manage, store, and control private information, then there was no dystopia, because sheople accept the use of tech-services over which they have no control. They don&#039;t want to trouble themselves with how any of it works, so the shell out their weekly earnings to pay for poison and toxic services that have no substantial social or economic return....<br /><br />WikiLeaks, encryption, and privacy are matters that only intelligent people are equipped to deal with. They who accept the responsibility must take action to secure their own personal privacy. There will never be a solution to global surveillance unless everyone steps up and demands privacy--by taking action on their own behalf.<br /><br />Good Luck.

This is how I felt after 9/11 and the passage of the Patriot Act. <br /><br />Growing up a bit and joining this community has changed my mind. I consider deleting my Facebook often and I think about mainly using Tor for all of my web browsing. Even though the government does not have a reason to watch me, does not mean I should not worry.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t be too surprised if mostly all digital communication is collected by the gov&#039;t. I read an article regarding the investigation into the recent bombings in Boston. It alleged that the FBI was able to listen to conversations between the first bomber and his wife that occurred prior to the occasion. They were trying to see what the wife really did or did not know.&nbsp; <br /><br />The FBI wasn&#039;t watching this guy prior to the incident though. So they probably didn&#039;t have an active wiretap. This means they must have been able to pull the conversations out of some sort of database. That really worries me. If this is true, than we really have come to a point where we have no privacy. <br /><br />Here is a link to another article that talks about the recorded phone conversations.

At least you blend in better that way.<br />

It&#039;s like bisexuals or homosexuals calling themselves Freedom Faggots, or something like that. That&#039;s how I interpret punk-titles.... either childish or annoying or childishly annoying. Sorry for any negativity about the movement.<br /><br />I should specify that my response strictly adheres to the following title: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Working Title</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Wikileaks, Encryption, and Surveillance<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Surveillance has no dystopic reality. Here&#039;s why. <br /><br />If people are concerned about privacy in the the rapidly developing digital (quantum) world, then there is a niche market for IT professionals to develop new companies and management of intellectual property--which includes personal information. As people get more educated with regard to digital privacy, then the navigation through the uncharted waters of innovation (ergo wikileaks, encryption, social media/tech, and 100% data capture of all written, spoken, and encrypted communications) will soon be very public and very manageable. Those who take the responsibility to protect themselves while coexisting in a politically hostile environment will be privileged to access information or conduct business with unnecessary breaches of privacy.<br /><br />Corporate lifestyles, just like military operations, enable secure means to doing business. I have previously made negative statements about corporations, but this was mostly flippant and emotional stress relief--a scream in a forest. In a more neutral tone, the great change in this Tor-ific revolution is that individuals now have access to knowledge and technology to pursue the same access to privacy and piece of mind as a sophisticated corporate infrastructure or military intelligence unit. <br /><br />There is nothing mysterious or original about users of TOR. Each generation and culture has changed from preceding generations, but more significant: so has technology. Crooks, crime lords, war lords, politicians, corporations, hobbyists, educators, policy makers, and media continue to do the same thing they&#039;ve always done. Technology has made it easier to connect the world. However, aside from the technological-intellectual (r)evolution, nothing has fundamentally changed.<br /><br />Facebook, Twitter, etc., have only enabled the ancient practice known as gossip to occur on a global scale in nanoseconds. Gossip hasn&#039;t changed.....

				&quot;If I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago and done no good to either you or to myself. ...for the truth is that no man who goes to war with you or any other multitude, honestly struggling against the commission of unrighteouosness and wrong in the State, will save his life; he who will really fight for right, if he would live even for a little while, must have a private station and not a public one.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.&quot;<br /><br />Socrates<br /><br />The more things change the more they stay the same. Or to quote one of the best show on TV EVER: &quot;All this has happened before and will happen again&quot;<br /><br />I have always been very political. My character flaw is an over abundance of empathy, which makes looking at the world and seeing all the injustice difficult. As i have aged i have realised the truth in the above wisdom, wisdom that is thousands of years old. It&#039;s why i&#039;m here. We can&#039;t fight the government, but we can help build something new, something better. SR and bitcoin is a beginning......as ancient power structures falter, as the banking/.gov parasite slowly kills the host (us) it has attached itself to, more and more people will move into underground economies. People from the east already understand this, they know they have to fear their government, people in the west live in the perpetual state of delusion that .gov is their friend. Slowly, ever so slowly that is changing though, and as more and more people start to abandon the existing power and monetary structures, we will starve the beast of what it needs: our consent.
