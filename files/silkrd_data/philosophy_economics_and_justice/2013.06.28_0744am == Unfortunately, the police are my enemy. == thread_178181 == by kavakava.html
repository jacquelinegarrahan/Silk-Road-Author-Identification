				This is an interesting point and one I can relate to. It baffles me that I am scared of the people who are meant to protect me and make me feel safe all because I wish to take chemicals.<br /><br />That said every police officer I&#039;ve spoken to has been a nice decent person simply doing there jobs. I don&#039;t hate them. I don&#039;t even hate what they stand for. I do however claim ownership over my body and mind and it pisses me off that they have to regulate that.

				Hey, you&#039;re committing crimes for which there are serious penalties. You are not on the same side.<br /><br />That being said - and here&#039;s a real tragedy - even if you gave up the Road, you can&#039;t ever know if you&#039;re on the same side as a particular cop, and having lethal force instantly available, and enough clout to cover up misconduct, you realistically can&#039;t trust them. Ever.<br /><br />What do the bad apples look like? Like all the rest, till they&#039;re putting a boot or bullet into your back, and then it&#039;s too late.

				I&#039;d have to say that the feeling of mistrust or fear of local police to be very mixed and influenced subjectively by the local, municipal, pronvicial/state and national levels. I personally don&#039;t feel I have anything to hide from cops and treat them respectfully, so long as I get respected back. Enforcement for personal use of something doesn&#039;t generally get enforced unless you are draw attention to yourself by doing something stupid.&nbsp; <br /><br />Since I&nbsp; am like anyone else day to day except for the very occasional time I might possess a small amount of illegal substances in public places, I don&#039;t feel that every encounter with the police will result in myself being searched. Often people become paranoid, and to a higher degree in places where penalties are high and/or enforcement is common and done with misconduct. Sometimes this may be the logical response, but sometimes it&#039;s truly unrealistic to to think you&#039;ll get caught unless you&#039;re constantly putting yourself at risk of these situations (based on facts and not your own perception).

				Depending on whether the cop is a complete meathead who programmed himself to lift, be a dick, trade patience for ego, and regurgitate a few rules while having fun playing &quot;who can give out the most citations&quot; or if they are genuinely good, nice, legitimate people who have just wanted to help the community.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know about other areas, but in mine it runs about 20/80.&nbsp; There are also the cops that are brainwashed to think that they are helping you out by arresting/charging you because you cannot make your own decisions.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can understand the opposition against drugs federally and morally, although this is only because a large portion of the population is too stupid to make real educated decisions.&nbsp; All things considered- fuck the feds, but some LLE are legit people.&nbsp;

				There aren&#039;t many things that I think are of worth simply in and of themselves -- without any further explanation required -- but loyalty is one of them.&nbsp; Any man or woman who is more loyal to a system -- regardless of any flaws it may have -- than to me is not one that I&#039;m willing to associate with unless forced to.&nbsp; Honestly I really don&#039;t know why anyone would ever feel any differently, unless of course they also made that system their first consideration.<br /><br />The fact that I don&#039;t do anything they&#039;d likely care about except take drugs doesn&#039;t really change anything, especially since I can&#039;t very well go around asking police &quot;hey, if I were your brother, would you fuck me over if I broke a stupid pointless law?&quot;&nbsp; The principle is what bothers me, really: I don&#039;t want someone I can&#039;t trust in my life any longer than absolutely necessary.

				I see what you mean, however I pay taxes and apart from certain activities that I currently limit to my body I abide to the law because it is still a valuable concept.<br /><br />Because I pay my taxes to pay their salaries I expect to be protected, NOT forced into submission.&nbsp; <br /><br />Where I live people LOVE having a piece of authority.&nbsp; They gloat and reassure themselves thanks to that little slice of power they have.&nbsp; It is part of their culture it seems, I am a foreigner so I can observe this trait.<br />Here you&#039;re likely to get looked down upon by anyone with even the smallest slice of this fictional power cake.&nbsp; Not always the case of course.<br /><br />You have LE officers that clearly have the intention of protecting and serving society.&nbsp; These are the ones that will treat you with the minimum amount of respect you deserve.&nbsp; They will only use their authority when required.&nbsp; They&#039;re usually the smartest of the lot.<br /><br />Then you have those that will assume you&#039;ve done something wrong whatever has happened to you.&nbsp; They&#039;re just the more suspicious ones and I fear, rather than hate, them.<br />Once I got chased after about 8 nutcases down a few streets for no reason whatsoever.&nbsp; They clearly were having a blast.&nbsp; I wasn&#039;t but it was good sport.&nbsp; Fortunately I got out of it and was able to say &quot; &#039;tis but a scratch&quot;.<br />I managed to track these idiots down with some riot police (brutally effective when you need them).&nbsp; However back at the police station I was asked several times what I did to piss them off and they wouldn&#039;t believe that I didn&#039;t even look or speak to them until one of them tried to punch me out of the blue.<br />That was extremely frustrating and was not helping anyone.<br /><br />Then you have the cowboys.&nbsp; You&#039;re a criminal if they think you look like one.&nbsp; They firmly believe the full force and consequence of the law should be applied in every situation.&nbsp; They will speak to you as though you were just another piece of shit just because your hair is a little weird.&nbsp; Their actions and words should never be contested, being polite to them doesn&#039;t help.&nbsp; Asking them to be polite or reasoning with them WILL piss them off.<br /><br />This last category is what has been dividing society.&nbsp; They even anger those who have done nothing wrong.&nbsp; They are the proof that developed countries are only so in terms of how much money is made and how many hamburgers we managed to sell each other.<br /><br />They are the ones I personally hate.&nbsp; The first category I am willing to help because they actually make their jobs harder by trying to make things better.

It just takes a little understanding to realize that LE are people too and people are prone to make mistakes. I dont defend the irresponsible behavior of LE one bit but I think you would be happier if you didnt view them as your enemy. This is not easy to do given our situation but there are other factors. There are the politicians and the failure of the people of this country to make the necessary changes we need to get the help and respect addicts deserve. But they are not necessarily your enemies though it may seem that way and some of the burden rests on all of us, we all must do more to be the change we want to see in the world.<br />&nbsp;In my opinion complacency and downright misunderstanding has led the US to take a turn for the worst.&nbsp; But the responsibility rests on all of us to do better for one another and ourselves. Getting caught up in the hate isnt going to help you at all, it will destroy you if you let it. Just my two cents.

It is not necessarily unfortunate that they are your enemy, however. To many, every living human being is each others&#039; enemy. This is a paranoid and extreme way of thinking and living, but is also a realistic and logical way of thinking. The police are willingly educated to do and think and say according to their jurisdiction&#039;s laws. If those laws change, so does their thinking and their behaviour - but only then. Look at them as enemies, yes, but very rigid ones who operate in set patterns. See them as people acting as obedient servants to your city, your country, even though they are human and are capable of rational thought. They might not want to pursue or arrest or prosecute you, but they have to; they chose their line of employment.<br /><br />Always know your limits, and always know theirs.

				I&#039;d sooner take my chances with the police than some lynch mob or your local &#039;mafia&#039; if you have one. <br /><br />In a former job, I had a bit of contact with the police (UK) and got to know a few pretty well. Quite a few used to be pretty fair with regards to drugs. As for psychedelics, I see the cops point of view as we have that many RCs out there that you can understand a cop might be actually worried for the teenager he/she just pulled over. If they let them go off with their drug of choice, the cop would be responsible for whatever happened. <br /><br />A lot of cops now are of the generations who have grown up with drugs. They went to school with kids who got high - they left and saw drugs in college, university and other training institutes. They have family who use drugs, hopefully in a responsible manner. <br /><br />You see, drug use has to be responsible, sadly, you will find many people on a cocktail of drugs on a Friday night - and some are dangerous people even sober. Add UK &#039;coke&#039; to the alcohol and shots - add whatever shit is there in the fake MDMA pills and I&#039;ll be honest, some clubs and pubs I avoid like the plague. <br /><br />I know coke ought to be a mellow high - you should be buzzing with social goodwill but UK coke tends to make some people stab you. We have &#039;E tablets&#039; that will make people want to fight! I&#039;ve seen it and have friends who are door security staff who have to deal with this shit week after week. They get battered and bruised so you can dance and have fun and not have some lowlife glassing you.<br /><br />So, not all drug use is making daisy chains in the meadows. There are assholes who spoil it for everyone. The police see the results of the drug dealers work in cutting up good drugs and turning them into anti social drugs. Fighting drugs. You can see young men bouncing around and looking for a fight all over the UK. And its not just alcohol involved. Adding stimulants to alocohol makes it worse if the user is some asshole.<br /><br />Of course, the criminalisation of drugs leads to drugs being messed around with. Cocaine should make you feel at one with the crowd. But, the people battering the hell out of each other on weekends in the UK (or any night really) are not buying the top yayo here! Nor the MDMA which, if it was pure, would NEVER promote violence ever!<br /><br />So, the police, I think most would sooner see a legalisation of some drugs, but psychedelics, I also know someone who works in mental health. In recent years they have seen more young people and they have a list of hundreds of RCs which are either causing mental health issues or triggering them. Years ago it was magic mushrooms and LSD. Valium was the cure - IV that into someone tripping their head off and you will bring them down to base camp pretty fast. Even so, LSD, too much of it, will turn you a bit off the charts.<br /><br />Now we have so many substances that although Valium is likely to bring down someome tripping, I&#039;m not sure if it works with 2CB or whatever. As for long term use - we are getting the figures as we go along. Its unchartered territory. LSD we know inside out. The other thousands of psych drugs, we are clueless really. They really are RESEARCH chemicals. The user being the experiment. <br /><br />We had the insane situation in which methadrone was nicknamed &#039;miow miow&#039; and 13 yr olds were eating it like it was sherbert. It was sold openly and this is a substance that makes weed seem like candy floss in comparison! I know for a fact that a good number of people were using methdrone daily - nobody knows what damage has been done because with the mind, there is a lot of shit we don&#039;t know. In physical terms, some of the RCs have to be causing some damage. There no highs that come without a zero price to pay or a risk factor. <br /><br />Its not just cops who are there to spot drugs or drug users. In the USA the children were taught to inform on mummy if she was smoking bud. In the UK any landlord of a pub is obliged to snitch on ANY drug use. Some pubs have door staff who have to search you! Decent staff will let personal amounts go, but if your carrying a bank bag with 50 wraps of cocaine, you will either be thrown to the cops or (better option) they take your cocaine, ask you to leave, and save it for the stay behind drink for staff and guests. Some will put it in the &#039;sin bag&#039; police give to all clubs so that patrons can leave anything illicit in there or door staff can throw confiscated substances in there. <br /><br />The worse is the drug tests for work! I am lucky, its not a big corporate firm, the boss snorts yayo by the 8-ball, we are cool to have a sly joint as long as we have no jobs that require sobriety, such as heights! But I got buddies who have to fast and use no drugs. Sucks but if the job is high wages, its maybe worth being sober for a few months. I&#039;ve done this but to be honest, would sooner take less pay and have fun like everyone else!<br /><br />Customs, they are our worse &#039;enemy&#039; for most of us here buying international for the cheaper prices, but as individuals, they are ok people. I know someone who works in customs. And for smugglers, its a game and everyone knows the rules. Smuggling on your person is stupid! Customs have seen every trick in the book and they get taught body language and over time gain a good sense of anything being off! So, post it!&nbsp; ;D MBB that shit, send it home to people you know and walk on that plane with a grin! <br /><br />And, if you are pulled by the police for smoking a joint of bud in your car. You are the asshole! That shit can be smelt about 30 cars down in traffic! The smell lingers for 24 hr. To the cop - your taking the piss - plus, smoking pot and driving is the same as drinking and driving. I know, I cannot smoke a joint of top quality UK bud and drive safely.&nbsp; <br /><br />If pulled by the police, you should remain polite, calm, and if you have any sense, you won&#039;t be sitting in a car stinking of the odour of a smoked joint! Also, don&#039;t leave bags of white powder in plain view! Cop may snort coke themselves, but they will be discreet. Many cops will simply glance in your car to see if your sloppy enough to leave evidence of drug use. To the cop - anyone who does not care about that detail is going to get a good checking over. If you don&#039;t giver a fuck about that little detail - you might be someone who is singing &#039;fuck the police&#039;&#039; and police don&#039;t like that. Don&#039;t EVER assume every cop is an asshole or jobsworth.<br /><br />Odds are, anyone could inform on you for drug use. Ex lovers, neighbours, managers of hotels (I have to watch that as every hotel has a fucking smoke alarm and big fines for smokers) and the cop is just the one who arrests you IF you leave evidence scattered around or tell too many people.<br /><br />Cops need only go on Facebook these days. Its how they catch a few people. I&#039;d keep your drug tales off Facebook and don&#039;t have a ganja leaf as your photo.<br /><br />I would say, its not cops who are the biggest enemy. They have nothing to do with the drug laws. The best thing for any drug user to do is be discreet. And being polite helps a lot. I&#039;ve walked away with my bud inspected by the cops, it was around 14 grams, they took a smell and told me that they would have nicked me IF I was smoking in the car. Another time, we got caught smoking when fishing. We called in after some scumbag was shooting at swans. Cops said it was a long time since they had seen some good Afghani black and thanked us for having a rubbish bin so all evidence of our smoking was taken away. Leaving evidence of smoking pot on some cops patch is taking the piss. Its also bad as children pick up on that and we don&#039;t want 12 yr olds smoking bud do we? <br /><br />Of course if cops had found a few kilos we would be nicked. Its not a personal thing, and no cop will let that much go unless he or she is corrupt. There are a lot less corrupt cops now. No more Rodney King beating because we all have video on our phones. The police get a decent wage, chance of promotion, plus a good pension and early retirement. Thats reasons to be honest. Its not to say all cops are but percentsge wise, its up there same as the general public population. 90% of people are honest. They would hand in your wallet/purse. The other 10% are all walks of life and most are oppertunist but some are dedicated scumbags. <br /><br />So my advice is, sure, the cops might arrest you, but if your making a living off drugs, its all in the game and you know that.<br /><br />For us users, unless we buy kilos of bud or ounces of yayo, be polite and you may even get off with a &#039;be more careful&#039; and no siezure or on the spot fine. Mouth off and you will be nicked. <br /><br />For anything purchases off SR, deny sending for anything and you will be safe as long as your not living in a home which is like some police forensic drug training centre. (shit hidden all over and in plain view)<br /><br />Some people give drugs a bad name.<br /><br />Sad but true.<br /><br />You do not want to have certain people in clubs or pubs - because they want to fight the world when on whatever they use.<br /><br />In fact, some cultures do use some drugs to gear them up for battles and wars. The Somalian militias who fought the Americans were high on khat. (they paid people/children in khat, gave them lots of ammunition and a gun to anyone over the age of 10)<br /><br />One final thought, would you sooner have the cops or burglars come through your door?<br /><br />In many areas, take away the police and the &#039;law&#039; would be arbitary. The police are only as good as the laws we have. Our laws are by no means perfect but check out the world and see how nations with no working laws get along. Usually its with AK47s and mob justice.<br /><br />I&#039;d sooner take my chances with the police!&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I smoke bud/hash for the main - no RCs, no heroin, no crack. Coke? I could live without it but its a special treat - and why not treat myself every few weeks/months?&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />Psychedelics, of course, I use those as the yearly cleansing ritual. All the shit that collects over a year - I like to let it go in one fell swoop by killing off the ego a little and letting go of all the petty useless negative shit we hold onto sometimes.<br /><br />I don&#039;t smoke in public areas, keep it hidden from children always and NEVER smoke in a car or be in a car with someone smoking unless I&#039;m not carrying any hash/bud myself. More people get nicked in a car smoking than you realise. Its EASY to pull over a car and take a sniff. If you been smoking in there - like I say - its like saying fuck the police.<br /><br />If you drive a car - make sure passengers leave that bud alone until you have a pit stop or reach the destination. <br /><br />And if you just fell in love - watch that one! Hope it is love - but if its not then he/she might inform on your drug use or whatever if it alls goes downhill with a bullet!<br /><br />&nbsp;;D

				It&#039;s completely normal to feel this way (cops as enemy), as they are getting more and more ruthless and seemingly think they are entitled to lord it over all us rgular guys, and to get away with as much punching and assorted violence as they can, up to and including murder.<br /><br />This will not stop.

				There is nothing worse than getting arrested for weed! That shit happened to me about 6 months ago. They were about to give me a fucking felony!!! All I had was weed. IT&#039;S JUST A PLANT, MAN. I WAS NOT HURTING ANYONE! GO ARREST SOMEONE WITH SOME METH (we have a bad meth problem in my area) OR A RAPIST! I didn&#039;t even have baggies, scales, or any other drugs at all. Luckily it was my first charge and it was lowered to a misdemeanor. Now I go to these bull shit classes every Wednesday and take piss tests every other week.

				I 100% agree with ya. Police do not police anymore. They only exist and get promotions through major busts. Busts are always drug related. Not policing.<br /><br />They really could be of huge use in the right areas and with the right tools. Unfortunately, that wouldn&#039;t make money.<br /><br />- IW

				Being raised in Greece made me really hateful against cops. <br /><br />The Greek cops are an abomination to the whole profession. Every time I meet them the where really offensive, uneducated and rude.<br />The problem with the Greek police is the evaluation of their work, skill and mental health. Many young people join the police force not because they like the profession, but because they either find it as a easy income or they really love having power. I had some good friends who actually joined the police and in all of them I saw life changes in their behavior. Being unsure what you want from your life and giving you a gun can really fuck up your character. There have been numerous examples of police officer that had mental problems and they still are members of this force. I will not start talking about police brutality, corruption and drug dealing. These are facts in Greece. They are the ones that are supposed to take the law by letter but they are the worse people when it comes in disobeying the law. They stop you for a simple check, you mention about your rights and you end up with a smack on your face and ordered no to talk or you get more.<br /><br />While on the other hand I have seen how gentle, kind and educated the most of the police officers are (at least in Europe that I have experience). I still have those feelings when I see a police car or officer and I get angry. <br /><br />I understand those police guys that can be rude and harsh when you are by prove an outlaw but I really HATE those who are against you when people are protesting against the political and economical system. If they protected the society and the people they should be with us protesting, but in the end they just protect the system and those bastards politicians and they freaking nonhuman system.<br /><br />To close my opinion, I can say that if my kids ever become gay, drug users, sex addicted or I don&#039;t know what I would be ok.<br />But if they ever decided to become police officers or bankers, ow that would probably hurt my feeling a lot!<br /><br />All the best people,<br />Adamiz

This is what the world has come to. People are too scared to take a risk. I am a bartender and guess what. you legally cannot have a drink if you do not have your ID on you. if youre 80 years old and youre sitting at my bar, I wont even card you. But, if youre stupid enough to say outloud that you dont have your ID, I wont serve you. A stranger isnt worth losing my job. Not now, not tomorrow, not ever. The only reason I would do shit like this is because cops are faggots and DO arrest people for retarded shit like this all the time.<br /><br />TL;DR: when in doubt, blame the police. (srs)

				When I was young with long hair in the late 70s, I would get pulled over all the time and searched. If I was honest with them, they wouldn&#039;t hold it against me and let me go. Twice I got caught living in my car and they let me go, with wishes for better luck. After getting out of the military in the 80s, I kept my hair short and stopped getting pulled over. The military taught me to begin or end my sentence with &quot;Sir&quot;. Most of the time, I would be let off with a warning. In the 90s, when ever I got pulled over, I left with a ticket, no matter how polite I was to them. I&#039;ve noticed a different mentality lately, they&#039;ve become militarized, unfeeling and uncaring. We&#039;ve become a revenue stream for a cities source of extra income.

				&nbsp; &nbsp; You know what bugs me the MOST about police, and what the WORST kind of cop is?<br /><br />&nbsp; The worst kind of cop is the one who doesn&#039;t know when he&#039;s won.&nbsp; &nbsp;This cop is so prideful, that when his &quot;spider-sense&quot; kicks in, he&#039;s sure you are holding, and he will do everything short of buggering you to find your drugs.&nbsp; They will fuck with you until every little piece of privacy, dignity, and every scrap of liberty is used up.&nbsp; Then, after they don&#039;t find anything, they steal your shit and try to get you on a traffic violation or bring back an empty candy wrapper or something to bring back as proof of a druggie.&nbsp; I honestly don&#039;t know how anyone could defend themselves in the US if drugs were planted in their vehicle, without video evidence.&nbsp; I&#039;ve been told by lawyers that it is next to impossible, which boggles my mind, if a cop can just take a bag from someone, split it, throw half in another car, two busts, no questions asked.&nbsp; &nbsp;It IS that bad, so bad that it is virtually impossible to defend a possession case when it comes to automobiles.&nbsp; It&#039;s also why I don&#039;t own a gun.&nbsp; I have tons of very savage mideval weaponry like crossbows and shit like that, but no guns.&nbsp; They can double, or triple a federal sentence based upon if you have guns or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fuck the police.

This is actually a terrible thing, and an inevitable consequence of prohibition.<br /><br />I’ve had an interest in psychedelic chemicals since I was young, and a certain thought pattern is now engraved in me. Even now as an adult, every time I see a cop, I automatically think “What have I got on me?”<br /><br />I see them as a threat, and although I’m always polite, I dislike them. This is a real tragedy because I am an (otherwise) law abiding, productive and peaceful person. <br /><br />Policing relies on community cooperation, and in my opinion, prohibition is the biggest wedge between the police and the community.

This guy probably hates cops just as bad as you and I do. I wouldnt be surprised if he&#039;s just an average guy that never does anything wrong or incriminating, and LE came in thinking he was selling shit to minors and gave him the shake down. this guy that used to sell me alcohol when I was underraged got a $10,000 ticket for his first offense of selling alcohol to a minor. It wasn&#039;t me that ratted him out but he refused to ever sell to me from that point forward. Blame the police man. Im sure that guy didnt want to card you. Why the fuck would he want to? Its always about the fear of cops. I wont even give a cop a mean look anymore just because of all the BULLSHIT i have gone through over some petty ass shit. <br /><br />A couple weeks ago I called an ex gf and left her a short, friendly voicemail asking if she wanted to grab coffee or some bullshit.&nbsp; I got a call 3 hours later by LE telling me that if I called her again they would arrest me for telephone harrassment. This is what the world has come to. People are too scared to take a risk. I am a bartender and guess what. you legally cannot have a drink if you do not have your ID on you. if youre 80 years old and youre sitting at my bar, I wont even card you. But, if youre stupid enough to say outloud that you dont have your ID, I wont serve you. A stranger isnt worth losing my job. Not now, not tomorrow, not ever. The only reason I would do shit like this is because cops are faggots and DO arrest people for retarded shit like this all the time.<br /><br />TL;DR: when in doubt, blame the police. (srs)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />No he just wanted to be a dick.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was a bartender for years,&nbsp; I know the job and I know what anyone who serves alcohol has to go thru,&nbsp; the guy was just an asshole, that&#039;s what really pissed me off.

				Good ol&#039; case of keep your friends close but your enemies closer. I&#039;m always very polite when dealing with officers whether it be a roadblock or a traffic violation. Try to strike up a personal conversation with them seems to go a long way. Like locally they just received all new cop cars the new Ford Taurus, so I just ask them how they like it that sort of shit seems to bring them to life and not act like a robot cop.<br /><br />The whole fuck the police mentality is a little ridiculous if you ask me. We are on the otherside of the law but lets face it they have jobs to do just like everyone else.<br />For instance if an employee of mine decided to show up to work drunk, I&#039;d have to punish him, either send him home or possibly fire him. He couldn&#039;t be mad because it was his poor decision that led to his demise. Same with us, we choose to either do or sell prohibited items so its the risk we take.<br />
