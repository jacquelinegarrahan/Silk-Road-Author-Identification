				I like what you have to say. However, I think a sitter is important for just about any dose. At least for the first experiment or two. <br />I think the original question is almost a trick question. IMO, there is no age like that of tobacco or alcohol. Like you said, sense of self is important. Also, just knowing you&#039;re ready. <br />I once asked my best friend if I was ready for acid. I knew what his answer was going to be. I guess I didn&#039;t want to face the truth. &quot;That&#039;s something you need to decide for yourself.&quot; I will not forget that anytime soon. <br />It could be from the amount of research one does and/or how comfortable one is with their own individuality, etc. but believing one is ready is very important. <br />On a short, somewhat off topic note I think is important, I find familiarizing myself with a drug before consumption helps immensely.

				first of all, does anybody give out acid for medical reasons anymore? second of all, I could see a point for and against that viewpoint. <br />for: the therapist knows the patient and the chemical. a surprise mind blowing (or even just enlightening) experience might help one conquer their demons or whatever. <br />against: maybe one could feel more comfortable and steer the drugs to help one where he/she needs help. or just not to freak out.

				If we&#039;re looking for a specific age... I&#039;d have to say 21.<br />Apparently the brain doesn&#039;t fully mature until the age of 21 and I feel tripping and maturity go hand in hand.

				Its a very hard question, but I think it comes with maturity when you understand WHAT the LSD will be doing, and what you yourself want to get out of it - once they realize they&#039;re going to take LSD not necessarily recreationally, but for some degree of insight.<br /><br /><br />I think pegging it at 21 may be &quot;safe,&quot; but there&#039;s easily people under that age who can handle, and are ready, to trip. Likewise, turning 21 doesn&#039;t mean acid will now be a fulfilling and enlightening journey, if you&#039;re not in the right mindset for it.

				It really depends on the person - same with drinking. My parents started allowing me to have a sip of beer at a young age. A little bottle of beer at say 10. And built me up. So when I started drinking at 13/14 I wasn&#039;t under the impression that alcohol was &#039;special&#039;. So though I have thrown up plentiful times - I have never &#039;passed out&#039;. I&#039;ve always made it back to my bed.<br /><br />Acid requires a mature mind. I first took it at the age of 19. But I could have quite happily taken it a year or 2 earlier. I would say 16 is too young.

				To be consistent with another thread on similar topic (age for drugs, in general or specific), I will say that - *for me* - the right age to try LSD would have been 15. <br /><br />I have absolutely zero authority to guess at the appropriate age for others if they have one.

				Too young is someone who does not take the responsibility for their health and safety. If someone has a friend they can trust their life in--in the possible event of panic or anxiety taking over, i.e. bad trip--and is willing to experiment, then they are old enough.<br /><br />If you want a physiological study done, then you are going to wait a very, very long time because the FDA and NSF are not willing to allow children to take LSD in a controlled study. This is the same category as the War on Sex (which I have stated elsewhere in the forums). Instead, they are part of the regime that says NO to drugs, and as a consequence, children will end up getting LSD on their own and find out for themselves how young is too young... Either we can legalize drugs and everyone can have better knowledge over the true effects of drugs--and not just compare statistics about crime/arrest/prison sentences, since many of these people have mental illnesses--not drug problems, which is a common consequence of mental illness.

Since social norms and the culture is very much the trip shaper. And drinking ages are part set based on when one is considered a grown adult determined by ability to make an income for himself and has a sense of health to know much and too much.<br />

				I was 13 too; I had no clue what &quot;tripping&quot; constituted. I had tried cannabis a few times and figured it would be a similar experience.The majority of my friends had older brothers, so access to drugs wasn&#039;t an issue.The hit was a Jerry Garcia Watercolor. Crazy fucking day; I took the hit during an 8th grade field trip. The excursion&#039;s destination was a local bowling alley, the day was more of a reward opposed to a typical educational function. I remember quite clearly the first instant I noticed the effects on my vision when attempting to bowl. The bowling pins appeared to be going into infinity.I had a pretty enjoyable experience even with the other kids attempting to bug me out jokingly. Although I did start to bug out towards the end of my trip.I personally wouldn&#039;t ever advocate for anyone under 18 to try LSD. Probably 21 is a good Idea, however, I&#039;ve never completed any research into the negative neurological effects.

				It&#039;s hard to pin-point an age since everyone&#039;s development varies, and is more dependent on both experience and the ability to learn rather than time alone (although the second often facilitates the first). So it&#039;s more a question of how thoroughly the person knows themselves and how strongly to hold their center while tripping, in order to have a pleasant and/or revelatory trip. Or in other words, it&#039;s just about how well you can keep your shit together.<br /><br />

				I started tripping at 15 and took 300+ trips by the time I was 20. I still turned out OK.<br /><br />But not everyone does. I think the danger with LSD is if you have an underlying psychological disorder, which usually starts to show symptoms in the early 20&#039;s. Taking LSD (or other psychedelics) can bring on symptoms sooner

				Good question. I first took acid at 23, would have taken it earlier had I been able to get it in my wee British one-horse-town. If I&#039;d taken it before I was, say 15 or 16 it probably would have been problematic. Even at 16, although I think it would have gone OK psychologically I don&#039;t think I would have appreciated the headspace like I did when I was more mature. The danger being that I may have tried it, laughed at the pretty colours and never really got what I ended up getting from it.<br />For me? I&#039;m gonna say 18/19 would have been the perfect age, anytime after 16 would have probably been OK, and 23 was just fine too.<br />My problem now is that I tend to hang out with older people who have kind of been there and done that...can always find a few potential psychonauts though so it&#039;s all good&nbsp; :)
