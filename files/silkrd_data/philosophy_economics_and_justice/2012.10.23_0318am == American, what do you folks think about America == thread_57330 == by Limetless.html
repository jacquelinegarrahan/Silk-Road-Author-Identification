				Having just watched the final debate it makes me wonder what Americans feel about the U.S as a whole. From an outsiders perspective personally I think a lot of stuff you have is really good and unique but there are a lot of faults as well but I have no idea what it&#039;s like to live in the U.S and be a U.S citizen. <br /><br />Please share. :)

				America is fucked. It is akin to a heroin addict that has reached rock bottom but is in full denial. Either the addict stops justifying his ways or dies.<br /><br />The debate is a sham. No real answers are given. Both parties are owned by the same special interests. Neither represent the people. The questions are known ahead of time and the answers are scripted. Neither candidate, if elected, holds any true power. The government of the United States has been highjacked since WWII. I love my country, but I hate my government.<br /><br />However, as America goes, so does Britain. This world is interconnected, so our fate inevitably destines yours. We are in this together. One must forget patriotism, forget national borders. Realize we are one species on one floating rock and work together or perish.<br /><br />It is really that simple. Instead we have two actors get on a stage and debate how they are going to fight wars instead of debating how not to fight wars. Two puppets who talk about not burdening the middle class when they are nothing but servants to Multinational corporations.<br /><br />A revolution is near. It is in the air. My fear is that it will be violent. This revolution must be peaceful. It is the only way to win. It is the only way to ensure future peace. If this revolution is won by violence, it will ultimately be run again by violence. Same oppression, different faces.<br /><br />I advise everyone not to vote. It is nothing but constructive consent to their power and decisions. I refuse to participate in a rigged system in which the People are given two candidates which are predetermined by billions of dollars from SuperPACs in campaign contributions.<br /><br />America contributed many great things to society. However it has turned into an absolute nightmare. At the moment I am not rioting in the streets as the citizens of Greece and Spain are presently doing. But that moment is not far away. For the U.S. and Britain as well.

It is interesting you brought those two up in the same post.<br />One does not realize that their entire youth was nothing more than an indoctrination camp similar to the Hitler youth.<br />We are taught simply to memorize and repeat. To be just smart enough to run the machines. To obey orders. And of course, to love your country more than planet earth.<br /><br />Every morning we recited the Pledge of Allegiance while placing our right hand over our heart and staring at the flag. We were taught the USA is number one and all other countries are inferior. The Federal Government has centralized the school curriculum through the Department of Education. As a result, the entire nation is taught nearly identical classes. No longer is their critical thought or problem solving emphasized. Only regurgitation.<br /><br />The media brainwashes one into yearning for material objects that one does not need. That one is ugly. That one needs to be a badass. That one needs a hot wife.<br />&nbsp;<br />Work is something that should be done Monday through Friday for longer than 8 hours. Two weeks vacation per year is not unheard of. People&#039;s stress levels are through the roof, as they continue to work and work but never get ahead. Many have been laid off from companies in which they have given 25 plus years.<br /><br />All the food is malnutrition. All the water is dirty. All the infrastructure is crumbling.<br /><br />As for when America became a nightmare, it would be the same time Britain became a nightmare. After WWII. <br />America completely devised their playbook from Great Britain. It was your colonization and things such as the British East India Tea Company which led the way for our new era of conquering nations through Economic Hitmen.<br /><br />Today, there are no leaders of nations. There is only a web of Banking, Military Industrial Complex and Multinational Corporations running the world. Including America and Britain.

				Two weeks holiday? Whaaaat? We get way more than that here. I asked about education because I believe that your education is the fundamental in your life and determines who you are going to be. <br /><br />The pledge thing I seen on the telly a couple of times and I find it a little disturbing but is it optional? Would you say, be punished if you were to abstain from it? <br /><br />Materialism is universal so I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s fundamental to the U.S but it appears the U.S as well as the U.K are worse than most. <br /><br />The water? You serious? The U.S ain&#039;t the third world surely? I been to your shores a few times and never seen this on a huge level.

				The biggest benefit of a college education these days is to have a better chance of working OUTSIDE of the USA.&nbsp; If you get an education today, chances are that you won&#039;t have a job when you get out of school.&nbsp; We have been brainwashed into believing a lie and that is why we are where we are currently.&nbsp; I believe we will experience a financial collapse and/or WWIII within the next 4 years.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve and QE3 practically guarantees it.&nbsp; The failing Petro dollar guarantees it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Notice you didn&#039;t hear ANYTHING about those during the debates?&nbsp; Nothing else matters if you don&#039;t take care of that problem....NOTHING.&nbsp; &nbsp;Obama is going to win again....I predicted it before Romney STOLE the Republican Nomination.&nbsp; We have two actor puppets that were chosen to run against each other so that we all fall for the illusion that we actually HAVE a choice....a voice.....a real vote.&nbsp; The truth is that it&#039;s all fixed and planned and the destination is NOT going to be a pleasant one....

				I love this country! But only the same as I love this world. Fuck poli-tics. It will never actually change anything. Only continue the back n forth match so status quo can continue to thrive, never changing really. It&#039;s designed to do just that. <br /><br />I watched the debates only for amusement. I will not vote. Hopefully the generations growing up will see the bullshit that all politics and government really are and perpetuate. It&#039;s been great for a time. But not for our future. We are governing ourselves here and we&#039;re a bunch of coke head heroin druggie drug dealers eh?! <br /><br />I hope at some point we will stop thinking so much about fake borders that don&#039;t really exist. And stop believing ANYTHING and EVERYTHING&nbsp; encompassing mainstream media. <br /><br />We are and have always been.... lied to by government. The United States is a corporation. A fiction. A business. It&#039;s not actually a country. It&#039;s not &quot;one nation&quot; under god. It&#039;s many nations. The education system is pure shit. I was disgusted in high school. It&#039;s entire design is to pump out mindless drones to live out their lives paying off ridiculous school loans that didn&#039;t really teach much of true value. I&#039;m so blown away at what our society is and how sick it really is. I think people need major therapy and trauma aid starting with the leaders and workers in government. I think the system needs to stop being about competition and consumption. Infinite growth paradigm. We are a stupid society most of the time. I can&#039;t wait till we move beyond the short sighted wheel spinning, doing very little to actually &quot;solve&quot; problems or move society forward. We have much more potential.

				I largely agree with what those above have said. This is a bad government and the source of most of the problems. Corporations, e.g. Microsoft, are also victims, who have to pay &quot;protection&quot; to do business. The schools are indoctrination centers. But the answer is in front of us. The internet, Bitcoin, online and offline black markets. If you love your children, home school them. There is help online, much if it for free. (e.g. Kahn Academy). Violence is coming, if you don&#039;t already have a gun get one or more while you still can, legally. Learn to use it and practice. The currency will become worthless. Buy and hold gold and silver. There&#039;s even a bank (Free Lakota Bank) which will pay generous interest on silver time deposits.&nbsp; If you have the space, buy and stockpile non-perishable foodstuffs. Even if inflation is &quot;only&quot; 10% a year, that&#039;s better interest than you can get at a bank, and you can eat it.

				The masses do what the masses do. It seems the majority of people in general, not just america, are somewhat or mostly asleep. Complacent. 9 to 5ers. Trust their doctor, and still believe the whole... &quot;If we just get OUR guy in their... they will really change things&quot;<br /><br />I&#039;m blown away that the elections are still going on like normal, but I do believe there is a larger amount of opting out folk then ever before. The media always plays it up. When the entire country and world were protesting about the US going into iraq, the media portrayed the massive festivals as much lower turnouts. <br /><br />I thought having a very intelligent president would make a difference as well. I knew it was all bullshit but I still had that shred of hope. I believe nothing on tv. I believe nothing the government tells me. NOTHING. <br /><br />I think most in America are still on the status quo train. Still believe it&#039;s the only way things can be. <br /><br />But the younger generations all seem to know about chemtrails, zeitgeist, fed reserve bullshit. molly is spreading the nation along with dub. I really thing there is a shift coming a long with the predictions of such. I do have hope and faith for humanity still. And I think we can all contribute significantly to the change. It&#039;s partly why I sell drugs ;)

				I&#039;ve always thought of America as a place of two extremes. Some of the best shit in the world is there or comes from there. On the other hand, a wealth of problems (not limited to just economic/financial ones) seem to come out of there too.

				That&#039;s basically how I see it and I think most non-Americans do. It does some great stuff but at the same time needs to reign itself in and address it&#039;s internal issues. I&#039;m really interested in what American life is like though, and the concept of &quot;what it means to be American&quot;.

As far as dirty water is concerned, a 2009 New York Times article stated: <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Millions in U.S. Drink Dirty Water, Records Show<br />By CHARLES DUHIGG<br />Published: December 7, 2009<br /><br />http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/business/energy-environment/08water.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0<br /><br />More than 20 percent of the nation&#039;s water treatment systems have violated key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act over the last five years, according to a New York Times analysis of federal data.<br /><br />hat law requires communities to deliver safe tap water to local residents. But since 2004, the water provided to more than 49 million people has contained illegal concentrations of chemicals like arsenic or radioactive substances like uranium, as well as dangerous bacteria often found in sewage.<br /><br />Regulators were informed of each of those violations as they occurred. But regulatory records show that fewer than 6 percent of the water systems that broke the law were ever fined or punished by state or federal officials, including those at the Environmental Protection Agency, which has ultimate responsibility for enforcing standards.<br /><br />Studies indicate that drinking water contaminants are linked to millions of instances of illness within the United States each year.<br /><br />In some instances, drinking water violations were one-time events, and probably posed little risk. But for hundreds of other systems, illegal contamination persisted for years, records show.<br /><br />On Tuesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works committee will question a high-ranking E.P.A. official about the agency&#039;s enforcement of drinking-water safety laws. The E.P.A. is expected to announce a new policy for how it polices the nation&#039;s 54,700 water systems.<br /><br />&quot;This administration has made it clear that clean water is a top priority,&quot; said an E.P.A. spokeswoman, Adora Andy, in response to questions regarding the agency&#039;s drinking water enforcement. The E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, this year announced a wide-ranging overhaul of enforcement of the Clean Water Act, which regulates pollution into waterways.<br /><br />&quot;The previous eight years provide a perfect example of what happens when political leadership fails to act to protect our health and the environment,&quot; Ms. Andy added.<br /><br />Water pollution has become a growing concern for some lawmakers as government oversight of polluters has waned. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, in 2007 asked the E.P.A. for data on Americans&#039; exposure to some contaminants in drinking water.<br /><br />The New York Times has compiled and analyzed millions of records from water systems and regulators around the nation, as part of a series of articles about worsening pollution in American waters, and regulators&#039; response.<br /><br />An analysis of E.P.A. data shows that Safe Drinking Water Act violations have occurred in parts of every state. In the prosperous town of Ramsey, N.J., for instance, drinking water tests since 2004 have detected illegal concentrations of arsenic, a carcinogen, and the dry cleaning solvent tetrachloroethylene, which has also been linked to cancer.<br /><br />In New York state, 205 water systems have broken the law by delivering tap water that contained illegal amounts of bacteria since 2004.<br /><br />However, almost none of those systems were ever punished. Ramsey was not fined for its water violations, for example, though a Ramsey official said that filtration systems have been installed since then. In New York, only three water systems were penalized for bacteria violations, according to federal data.<br /><br />The problem, say current and former government officials, is that enforcing the Safe Drinking Water Act has not been a federal priority.<br /><br />&quot;There is significant reluctance within the E.P.A. and Justice Department to bring actions against municipalities, because there&#039;s a view that they are often cash-strapped, and fines would ultimately be paid by local taxpayers,&quot; said David Uhlmann, who headed the environmental crimes division at the Justice Department until 2007.<br /><br />&quot;But some systems won&#039;t come into compliance unless they are forced to,&quot; added Mr. Uhlmann, who now teaches at the University of Michigan law school. &quot;And sometimes a court order is the only way to get local governments to spend what is needed.&quot;<br /><br />A half-dozen current and former E.P.A. officials said in interviews that they tried to prod the agency to enforce the drinking-water law, but found little support.<br /><br />&quot;I proposed drinking water cases, but they got shut down so fast that I&#039;ve pretty much stopped even looking at the violations,&quot; said one longtime E.P.A. enforcement official who, like others, requested anonymity for fear of reprisals. &quot;The top people want big headlines and million-dollar settlements. That&#039;s not drinking-water cases.&quot;<br /><br />The majority of drinking water violations since 2004 have occurred at water systems serving fewer than 20,000 residents, where resources and managerial expertise are often in short supply.<br /><br />It is unclear precisely how many American illnesses are linked to contaminated drinking water. Many of the most dangerous contaminants regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act have been tied to diseases like cancer that can take years to develop. <br /><br />But scientific research indicates that as many as 19 million Americans may become ill each year due to just the parasites, viruses and bacteria in drinking water. Certain types of cancer — such as breast and prostate cancer — have risen over the past 30 years, and research indicates they are likely tied to pollutants like those found in drinking water.<br /><br />The violations counted by the Times analysis include only situations where residents were exposed to dangerous contaminants, and exclude violations that involved paperwork or other minor problems.<br /><br />In response to inquiries submitted by Senator Boxer, the E.P.A. has reported that more than three million Americans have been exposed since 2005 to drinking water with illegal concentrations of arsenic and radioactive elements, both of which have been linked to cancer at small doses.<br /><br />In some areas, the amount of radium detected in drinking water was 2,000 percent higher than the legal limit, according to E.P.A. data.<br /><br />But federal regulators fined or punished fewer than 8 percent of water systems that violated the arsenic and radioactive standards. The E.P.A., in a statement, said that in a majority of situations, state regulators used informal methods — like providing technical assistance — to help systems that had violated the rules.<br /><br />But many systems remained out of compliance, even after aid was offered, according to E.P.A. data. And for over a quarter of systems that violated the arsenic or radioactivity standards, there is no record that they were ever contacted by a regulator, even after they sent in paperwork revealing their violations.<br /><br />Those figures are particularly worrisome, say researchers, because the Safe Drinking Water Act&#039;s limits on arsenic are so weak to begin with. A system could deliver tap water that puts residents at a 1-in-600 risk of developing bladder cancer from arsenic, and still comply with the law.<br /><br />Despite the expected announcement of reforms, some mid-level E.P.A. regulators say they are skeptical that any change will occur.<br /><br />&quot;The same people who told us to ignore Safe Drinking Water Act violations are still running the divisions,&quot; said one mid-level E.P.A. official. &quot;There&#039;s no accountability, and so nothing&#039;s going to change.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>

				I am not happy with the state of things here. Our country was founded on certain principles and ideas that have now been all but erased by greed and corporate corruption of the government. If I had any sort of funds I would move to South America and deal with the crime and corruption there than here. My friend moved to Santiago, Chile two years ago and has never looked back. He use to be depressed and paranoid over the current situation in the States, but is now happy and living to his full potential.

				The good thing about South America is you don&#039;t have to be very rich to be very rich down there. My friend was low middle class, but down in Chile he is considered wealthy. <br /><br />If you buy locally down there it is super cheap, but if you want American stuff like Jordans then expect the same or higher prices than here.

				America is failing, not as a country but as America. We are anything but free, we are no more free than any other developed country, America is no longer special its just another big global power.<br /><br />Our politics are even worse, it doesn&#039;t even matter who you vote for because neither party represents the ideals their respective parties are founded on, the represent the interests of the big time corporations that finance their campaigns.<br /><br />I think the problem is the &quot;winner take all&quot; political system we have. If 51% of the country votes democrat, then the democratic party get 100% of the representation in government. That&#039;s not fair, they should get 51% representation while the republican get 49% representation, after all 49% of the country voted republican! More importantly, smaller parties have no chance of having any say because they never get close to 51%. In a truly fair political system, if 5% of the country voted for the libertarian party then the libertarian party would have 5% representation in the government, for example. <br /><br />Its impossible to have meaningful change with a winner take all system because for 4 years the democrats have the power and make their changes and then 4 years later the republicans are in power and the reverse the changes and make their own and it just goes back and forth. If we had many parties participating in government, we would see some changes that everyone agrees to so they would stick. Right now both republicans and democrats have good ideas on improving the country but they will never have time to actually work because as soon as the other party gets in they change things. <br /><br />It seems like US politics is just a big game designed to see who is better at convincing people to vote for them.

				Hmmm, okay, politics aside....<br /><br />I think you can find that America is sort of a Jekyll and Hyde thing, schizophrenic, or bipolar maybe. We are a nation of superlatives, hence, we do some good things better than anyone else, but we also excel at doing bad.<br /><br />I&#039;m not addressing politics here at all, you got plenty of discussion of that in previous posts.<br /><br />First things first, there isn&#039;t &quot;one&quot; America. The range of cultures and landscapes going from east to west and north to south couldn&#039;t be any more diverse. America in New York is like a different galaxy than America in Cheyenne, Wyoming, or LA or Seattle. So, trying to describe it as one nation will invariably fail. Going back to politics, you can notice that by the country having traditionally red states and traditionally blue states.<br /><br />Conversely, growing up in America can range from &quot;the best place in the world to be&quot; to a nightmare matching Dante&#039;s Inferno. Smalltown America can be a beautiful thing, it can also be a nightmare, same applies for the big cities.<br /><br />Since you are asking from a EU perspective, let me touch on some things that are most apparent. Growing up and living in America first and foremost means getting your shit together or you&#039;ll keel over. We lack many of the luxuries Europeans enjoy, like real unemployment benefits or healthcare no matter what. That means from early childhood on, you&#039;re being taught that you need to cover your own ass. No one will bail you out (unless you are a really big bank :P) That&#039;s why some perceive Americans as &quot;fearful&quot;, but what it really is, is more of an awareness that if shit hits the fan you are on your own. We also don&#039;t have much protection when it comes to employment or housing. In most European countries, landlords have to go through a lengthy court process to evict tenants, in the US your rent is overdue 14 to 30 days and you are out on the street no questions asked (notice term depends on state). Same with employment. In the EU, you stay in a company for over a year, and you know your job is safe. In the US the pink slip is always glooming over your head, no matter how good you are. If some corporate fuck determines you, or your branch or your department isn&#039;t profitable enough or what have you, buh bye. The bad thing is, since the population is so big, people are really only judged by their credit score anymore. If some shit happens to you, and you fall behind on some bills, it is virtually impossible to find decent housing or even good work.<br /><br />Living like that feels &quot;different&quot; than living in Europe. You are constantly more &quot;on guard&quot;.<br /><br />The next thing you will notice is that we have an exponentially&nbsp; high number of really really stupid/ignorant/semi-retarded people. But, with the superlatives again, we also have droves of the smartest people of the world.<br /><br />To put it simple, if you are born into the right social &quot;class&quot; and have a family support structure, America can be the greatest country to live in in the world. If you lack that, you might end up really shit out of luck.<br /><br />Hence, defiance is a strong part of our identity. You may notice that most Americans have a penchant to &quot;rail against the system&quot;, instead of exploring avenues to change it from within. It&#039;s part of who we are. <br /><br />Nowadays the country is split down about in the middle. There is an ever growing number of people realizing that the glorified red white and blue with all the parades and the holidays has failed, in terms of foreign policy, the laws we have allowed to be enacted, and the impact unrestrained corporatism has had on our social structure. So that&#039;s all work in progress.<br /><br />Sorry dude was ready to write a whole essay but now the drugs just kicked in.....to be continued....lol....

				----Nice thread Limetless and I&#039;ve seen the first two debates and would say that either candidate does as they please to &quot;appeal&quot; to certain voters. The American political process has become yet another television show in which the uninformed and easily swayed viewer is fed scientifically designed bullshit to pander to their emotions. These uninformed viewers are not only lacking in intellectual ability they are also out-of-touch with the reality that this planet and its people are in pain. In short we are concerned with unimportant issues and illusions created by corporate backed and government approved media.<br /><br />----The other problem is that this country is EXTREMELY polarized between the American ideas of left and right (I believe the American definition of Right and Left is different from the European definition). On one hand you have a large number of Right-wing Christian nationalists who hold onto to the ideas of a bygone era and hope to reestablish them so that &quot;we may return to our former glory&quot;. Personally I think that this group is quite dangerous because they discourage change and growth.<br /><br />----On the other side of the political spectrum we have persons who believe that the government is the way that we solve our problems. The problem with the left is that they are usually quite ineffective (story of the government) and even though they may have some good ideas they rarely make things happen.<br /><br />----The only solution I see to the predicament of poor leadership is greater decentralization of power and a MASSIVE AND COMPLETE overhaul of ALL intellectual institutions so that people can become more intelligent and make decisions for themselves. That&#039;s my 2 cents.<br />&nbsp;

				Most of the sentiments from my fellow Americans within this thread reflect my own line of thinking. I am beginning to see that trend growing throughout my circle of friends and family which gives me hope.<br /><br />Things are stirring and there is an electricity brewing. We are enslaved, not by fear and force (Unless you count the NDAA, TSA and Patriot Act) but by our comforts and complacency. We have all we need and we have it in excess which sedates most of the social unrest.

				I don&#039;t see the American government as a omniscient, all powerful entity that operates completely independently from the wishes of it&#039;s governed. Whatever actions our government takes are a direct results of the sentiments that come from it&#039;s own citizens. An intolerant, oppressive state is always going to be empowered by intolerant, oppressive people. <br />A government can&#039;t be inherently evil; it is only a concept. It has no mind of it&#039;s own, no real motive. It can be likened to a weapon to be wielded by the population&#039;s 51% to oppress the other 49 <br />So when I take a look at my government and feel nothing but disgust, I remind myself that it is a result of generations of cowardly, intolerant voters who brought this on all of us through a general lack of responsibility, and an eagerness to benefit themselves at the expense of others.<br /><br />-schmuck

When I say &quot;you,&quot; I mean most of America, not you specifically. The reason I&#039;m quoting your post is because I see this same attitude across America and this is DANGEROUS thinking.<br /><br />This is possibly the biggest problem in America. You were given a good life, you got lucky and managed to get a decent education and job, and so you think that mostly everything is a-okay. But fewer and fewer people are born into that every year, but we do nothing about it.<br /><br />You say you feel safe. You say you don&#039;t like everything the government does, but &quot;you do what you can do?&quot; What exactly do you do? Is it holding your politicians accountable by voting once every couple years. Because that&#039;s obviously working out really well.<br /><br />You are not safe. That is an illusion. The US government has amassed copious amounts of extra power since 9/11 under the guise of national security, and they will never give it up. You are under constant surveillance and scrutiny from all angles, yet you give your consent to this by voting more politicians into office. Do you really believe that there is a difference between the two parties? They both want power and they know to keep it, they need to maintain a divided country. They&#039;ve been hugely successful at that.<br /><br />Your politicians don&#039;t give a shit about you. Not a the local level, not at the state level, not at the national level. They&#039;re bought and owned by companies and corporations as soon as they take office - or possibly before the election has even happened - because with that power they were just given &quot;by the people&quot; they&#039;re going to make lots of money and friends off the books. Why else spend years and millions of dollars campaigning for a position that pays a small fraction of that money? Voting one snake out office so another can take its place is a push at best.<br /><br />Working hard, playing hard, loving your family and saying fuck all to everything else does nothing for the country as a whole. it&#039;s that self-centered, selfish, and ignorant thinking that allowed the career politician to come into being in the first place. People may indeed be largely to blame for the choices they&#039;ve made, but when you are playing against a dealer with a loaded deck, what chance did you ever have anyway?

				USA is full of religious fanatics who have far too much control over the nation and world. It is a hypocritical country that only pretends to follow its own constitution.

				Why exactly do they restrict our freedom more and more as time goes on and monitor all parts of our private lives?<br /><br />They can, more power and control over the people solidifying their power. If you are in a position of power the last thing you want is people doing things unmonitored and that you don&#039;t agree with.<br /><br />They will have some excuse like a national emergency and declare that we leave our homes and go to government sanctioned places to be safe and if we don&#039;t we are breaking the law. Then they can cease our private property and assets.<br /><br />Why wouldn&#039;t they want to do this is a better question. They show every action that they want more power and control and are already leaning towards this type of behavior and have already built the places to house us just for this purpose. Why did they want to lock up all the Asian people during Pearl Harbor? Do you really think it was for our protection like the Asian population would rise in the US after the Pearl Harbor attack and take over? No, they did it because they had an excuse to and saw it as an opportunity to exert their power without being questioned and make money from it.<br /><br />They would of done it to all the Arabs today after 9/11 if they knew the public would of been behind it like they were with the Asians (I say Asians and not Japanese, because many weren&#039;t Japanese that got locked up)

There are three of the most widely known religious exceptions made to the controlled substance act. If I am busted with peyote I will go to prison. If I am busted with DMT I will go to prison. I HAVE gotten in trouble for drinking underage in the past. These laws have a foundation in religion. Religious sentiment is largely responsible for prohibition, it was in the case of alcohol and it is in the case of other recreational drugs as well. The constitution of the United States claims that there shall be no laws favoring one religion over another. This is CLEARLY not enforced in practice, or else there would not be native Americans legally getting high on mescaline, people in Santo Daime getting legally high on DMT or underage Catholic children drinking wine regardless of the amount they consume. There is no religious equality in U.S.A. , there are exceptions made for specific groups and there are entire laws made just so a bunch of brain fucked Christians don&#039;t get their panties up in a bundle. And don&#039;t even get me started on gay marriage being illegal, that is entirely to appease a bunch of brain dead primitive sky wizard worshipers and it is EXPLICITLY FORBIDDEN for this to happen in the constitution.

				These posts have been highly refreshing. <br /><br />Remember, it is not just America. It is Britain and Israel as well. These are the three allied nations running the world through banking and the Military Industrial Complex. All their hands are dripping with blood.<br /><br />To defeat this enemy is to not give money. Buy local, buy less, buy underground to avoid taxes.<br />We will never defeat them militarily. That is what they have mastered...the battlefield.<br />The only thing they don&#039;t know how to defeat is LOVE. I know it sounds like hippie bullshit but it true.<br />Simple non-resistance. Refusal to participate. I am NOT playing their game.<br /><br />As such, never, ever vote. When the voter turnout hits 20% how can they argue their representation is legitimate. It wouldn&#039;t be. The people have vote a loss of confidence in the system by not voting. <br /><br />Voting in this election is constructive consent to the War on Drugs. Yes, that war. The one that has relegated you to the darkweb and if you slip up, you will loss of your freedom faster than you can blink. Let alone the countless atrocities this rogue web of power addicted scum commit each day. Do not consent to their decisions and actions.<br /><br />America is gone. Britain is gone. Israel is gone. No citizens of these nations can be proud of their governments. They are ruthless murderers whose only motive is profit. Hell, the EU is nothing but a sham as well. Look at Spain and Greece.<br /><br />Since the elite have decided borders are meaningless. the citizens of Earth should as well. Its time to come together. <br /><br />And it looks like the Road&#039;s community is light years ahead of any other forum I have seen on the clearweb. Funny how Silk Road users seem to be the most enlightened.<br />

				It is awesome!! I think of course. Do they even make kids still do the pledge? I know for a fact they let kids sit out. I was confused about it when I moved to a bigger city and saw some kids not having to do it. I realiZed that they must have had parents who talked about it with them. I thought it was not a good thing they were sitting out. The water thing, I guess I never knew about. <br />In all honesty we are a little embarrassed about somethings American, but that is how it is. This is a diverse population. Politics are everywhere and conflict is everywhere. It seems the trend on the internet for Americans is to talk crap. There are things, but it isn&#039;t horrible at all. There are others that think everything is amazing about America. Wouldn&#039;t agree with those people.

You were given a good life, you got lucky and managed to get a decent education and job, and so you think that mostly everything is a-okay. But fewer and fewer people are born into that every year, but we do nothing about it.&quot;<br /><br />Given a good life by hard working parents &amp; now i&#039;m attempting to GIVE the same thing to my children.&nbsp; My wife does something about the ones who weren&#039;t born with that every day while i work for our family and i know lots of people who do something about it.&nbsp; It may be not enough, but &quot;nothing&quot; is not accurate.<br /><br />&quot;You say you feel safe. You say you don&#039;t like everything the government does, but &quot;you do what you can do?&quot; What exactly do you do? Is it holding your politicians accountable by voting once every couple years. Because that&#039;s obviously working out really well.&quot;<br /><br />Quite a bit more than just voting once every couple of years and yes i do what i can do.&nbsp; What else can a person do?<br /><br />&quot;You are not safe. That is an illusion. The US government has amassed copious amounts of extra power since 9/11 under the guise of national security, and they will never give it up. You are under constant surveillance and scrutiny from all angles, yet you give your consent to this by voting more politicians into office. Do you really believe that there is a difference between the two parties? They both want power and they know to keep it, they need to maintain a divided country. They&#039;ve been hugely successful at that.&quot;<br /><br />At this point i feel my viewpoint isn&#039;t the one that is full of &quot;illusions&quot;.&nbsp; I agree they have amassed more power and i don&#039;t see huge differences between the two parties.<br /><br />&quot;Working hard, playing hard, loving your family and saying fuck all to everything else does nothing for the country as a whole. it&#039;s that self-centered, selfish, and ignorant thinking that allowed the career politician to come into being in the first place. People may indeed be largely to blame for the choices they&#039;ve made, but when you are playing against a dealer with a loaded deck, what chance did you ever have anyway?&quot;<br />[/quote]<br /><br />Your making A LOT of assumptions in recapping what i said.&nbsp; I never said fuck all to everything else.&nbsp; <br />People are largely to blame for the choices they&#039;ve made including myself.&nbsp; When you are playing with a dealer with a loaded deck and you have only one hand to play you had better work hard with whatever chance you have.&nbsp; Don&#039;t just lay down and say fuck it this isn&#039;t fair i quit.

				SR seems to take a dim view of the USA, when I was 20 i&#039;d have agreed.&nbsp; But having lived here for most of my life I now realize that I was lucky to have been born in the USA and it&#039;s actually not a bad place at all.<br /><br />As schmuck says whether you love it or hate it it is simply a political system, a machine that reflects the competency and will of the voting citizens.&nbsp; It was put together as a half-ass compromise by a bunch of drunken white men 230 years ago and it&#039;s held up till today.&nbsp; It&#039;s far from perfect, but it could be much much worse, on balance the US is OK.<br /><br />There are some out there that might be able to craft a better system, but certainly not the people of SR.&nbsp; If there&#039;s one thing I&#039;ve realized it&#039;s that the stupid far outnumber the smart here.&nbsp; Just like in the streets of the USA, just like everywhere else in the world.&nbsp; None of you are as retarded as all of you put together.<br /><br />Like any countries there are pros/cons, there&#039;s the good and the bad, but on a whole the USA is a nice place to live, and on average the US government tends to be a force for good rather than evil in this world. <br /><br />pros:<br />-general stability of the nation and the region: no major wars fought on the continent since the US civil war.<br />-Generally good education system, an excellent higher education system, and free &amp; independent academic institutions (some of the best in the world)<br />-NSF, NIH, NASA, national labs, some of the best research orgs on the planet.<br />-Good job opportunities &amp; generally good pay, strong economy compared to most places.<br />-OK healthcare.. amazing healthcare if you have the money or insurance (i do so i&#039;m not complaining)<br />-all volunteer military (well nowadays at least)<br />-Bill of rights (Freedom of speech, guaranteed rights for all citizens), rule of law.<br />-Beautiful massive expanse of territory and our national parks are amazing, a wealth of natural resources<br />-a huge amount of very smart people, so many of the best and brightest minds from all over the world have come to the USA for job opportunities (I was lucky enough to work with many of them during my days in the aerospace industry)<br />-generally solid &amp; functional infrastructure.<br />-low levels of corruption<br />-reasonable cost of living.<br />-independent judiciary.&nbsp; An overall good judicial system<br />-reasonable cost of living in most of the US.<br /><br /><br /><br />cons<br />-only 2 political parties with any real power<br />-higher crime rates than much of western Europe (a lot more guns) but still much safer than most other countries<br />-a lot of stupid people<br />-lack of social mobility (a little better than the UK, but that&#039;s not saying much)<br />-lots of religious wackos (a big thank you to Europe for sending them all here)<br />-outdated and failed drug policy (should legalize pot and non addictive drugs, focus the crack down on the really addictive &amp; harmful things)<br />-outdated environmental policy &amp; energy policy (we need to just go full-on nuclear &amp; use electric for everything) <br />-too much patriotism, people here should see themselves as citizens of the world first and citizens of the country second.<br />-political system is overly influenced by $$ (consequence of the stupid masses again)<br />-too much military spending and too much focus on military security. (again, caused by the ignorant masses)<br />-too many crazys &amp; homeless people.&nbsp; (I hate panhandlers)<br /><br />On a whole the US is a great place to live, If you are willing to work hard or if you&#039;re educated you&#039;ll do fine, make good pay, and live a great life.&nbsp; If you&#039;re lazy or stupid you&#039;ll be screwed and there&#039;s not much of a social safety net to help you.<br /><br /><br />At least we don&#039;t have many gypsies.<br /><br /><br />Bob<br /><br /><br />

And I&#039;m certainly not out to get into a drama battle with you, but frankly, I just have to rebut your pros:<br /><br />-general stability of the nation and the region: no major wars fought on the continent since the US civil war.<br />True, albeit not a product of good policy but rather geographical advantage, but yes, a pro<br /><br />-Generally good education system, an excellent higher education system, and free &amp; independent academic institutions (some of the best in the world)<br />Not to be rude, but, preposterous statement. On average, our graduates lack behind the entire world except self-confidence. Unless your family is really saddled and able to tutor and legacy your way into the ivy league you are FUCKED. Whadday think why a 4 year community college degree qualifies you for...uhm...becoming shift manager at Starbucks or Subway if you&#039;re lucky? Sorry man, but all studies out there debunk your statement.<br /><br />-NSF, NIH, NASA, national labs, some of the best research orgs on the planet.<br />-Partially true. However, many studies and statistics suggest that the perceived prolific innovation is a fallacy based on our outrageous number of patent registrations, which turns out to be a lot of recycling or humbug like patenting genes.<br /><br />-Good job opportunities &amp; generally good pay, strong economy compared to most places.<br />Good pay? I&#039;m an expat now living overseas, and I can tell you that most definitely that the income level of average workers in the US lacks far behind the rest of the civilized western world, also, much longer hours and less vacation and very often not even proper health care. Sure, there are &quot;some&quot; highly specialized fields where we pay out more, but that is offset by the masses of underpaid low-income/long-hours/no benefits jobs. We have plenty of jobs in the US, but hardly any good careers anymore.<br /><br />-OK healthcare.. amazing healthcare if you have the money or insurance (i do so i&#039;m not complaining)<br />Sure, if you can afford to fork out 800, 900, 1000 bucks a month you get a great PPO, but with a median household income of around 50k for a family of 4, you get my meaning.<br /><br />-all volunteer military (well nowadays at least)<br />That&#039;s a good thing for sure<br /><br />-Bill of rights (Freedom of speech, guaranteed rights for all citizens), rule of law.<br />Freedom of speech, sure, we have that. Rule of law? Sure, if you got the cash for a good lawyer. The disparity in sentencing based on socio-economic class and ethnicity cries to the heavens. We have the highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world, surpassing China and Russia. Just let that sink in please. You are more likely to end up in prison in the US than in China, I mean W T F!!!! <br /><br />-Beautiful massive expanse of territory and our national parks are amazing, a wealth of natural resources<br />True dat. Partially at least. It is truly one of the most beautiful countries on earth. Natural resources, well oil peaked already and is on the decline, so are precious metals. But yeah.<br /><br />-a huge amount of very smart people, so many of the best and brightest minds from all over the world have come to the USA for job opportunities (I was lucky enough to work with many of them during my days in the aerospace industry)<br />True.<br /><br />-generally solid &amp; functional infrastructure.<br />Oh boy, what should I say. Where I am now I hit the highway in a 380hp car and floor it for hours, the road is so well engineered its just smooth, some of the fastest trains in the world and they even are on schedule, I get a 5MB (yeah, Megabyte, not bit) DSLv2 line for 30 bucks a month including phoneline, and my cellphone never has less than 4 bars. Switch to US: The fucking highways are a disastrous pothole collection no matter where you go, bridges collapse under cars all over the country, fuhgeddabout taking a train, and in most metropolitan areas they dun even post bus schedules anymore because they won&#039;t be on time anyways. Sure, there&#039;s FiOS in a few select areas, but other than that have fun downloading at 100k if you are lucky. And don&#039;t get me started on cell reception. So no, I would not call our infrastructure solid at all. It was, in the 70s maybe.<br /><br />-low levels of corruption<br />Well, you usually can&#039;t bribe a cop on the road, but our lawmakers sure as hell are to be had at wholesale. Just ask Sheldon Addelson.<br /><br />-reasonable cost of living.<br />You gotta be kidding, right? Well, okay, if you factor in cheap Chinese shit at WalMart. If you go where living is affordable, you have a hard time finding a job, if you go where the jobs are, you have a hard time making rent. <br /><br />-independent judiciary.&nbsp; An overall good judicial system<br />I don&#039;t even know how to respond to that. Seriously dude?<br /><br />-reasonable cost of living in most of the US.<br />Except where the jobs are.<br /><br />Sorry man, but it is obvious that you are one of the ever-shrinking class of people that have gotten the right start. That&#039;s okay and nothing to feel bad about. But please, don&#039;t think that just because you got started off right (e.g. parents that actually had the time to make sure you get through highschool proper and had the funds to land you in a proper college after) everyone has a shot at it. The social injustice in America cries to the heavens, and if you are born to the wrong parents, your path is drawn for you (except in Disney movies, where the underdog always gets his fair shot and wins).

The range of cultures and landscapes going from east to west and north to south couldn&#039;t be any more diverse. America in New York is like a different galaxy than America in Cheyenne, Wyoming, or LA or Seattle. So, trying to describe it as one nation will invariably fail. Going back to politics, you can notice that by the country having traditionally red states and traditionally blue states.<br /><br />Conversely, growing up in America can range from &quot;the best place in the world to be&quot; to a nightmare matching Dante&#039;s Inferno. Smalltown America can be a beautiful thing, it can also be a nightmare, same applies for the big cities.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />+1<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=57330.msg543549#msg543549">Quote from: Schmuckk on October 24, 2012, 05:20 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I don&#039;t see the American government as a omniscient, all powerful entity that operates completely independently from the wishes of it&#039;s governed. Whatever actions our government takes are a direct results of the sentiments that come from it&#039;s own citizens. An intolerant, oppressive state is always going to be empowered by intolerant, oppressive people. <br />A government can&#039;t be inherently evil; it is only a concept. It has no mind of it&#039;s own, no real motive. It can be likened to a weapon to be wielded by the population&#039;s 51% to oppress the other 49 <br />So when I take a look at my government and feel nothing but disgust, I remind myself that it is a result of generations of cowardly, intolerant voters who brought this on all of us through a general lack of responsibility, and an eagerness to benefit themselves at the expense of others.<br /><br />-schmuck<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I can&#039;t agree.<br /><br />It&#039;s not that having good people doesn&#039;t make a difference. It does. It&#039;s just that it entirely depends on what level of organization we&#039;re talking about. In a small corporation good people can be effective at causing positive changes, in a much larger one, less so. They sort of get averaged out. Fundamentally it&#039;s the system&#039;s structure that determines outcomes. Everybody is the product of the system, and if that system is configured incorrectly, then the results are plain to see. I don&#039;t think the Nazis or the Communists were especially terrible taken on an individual level. I just think their systems were configured in such a way that regular people did awful things to each other.<br /><br />A system can be good or evil, you&#039;re being far too relativistic there. A system *does* have a mind of its own. The market is an excellent example of such an &#039;extended phenotype&#039;. Any collective does have an ethos, a spirit, a mind, a style, a paradigm, whatever you want to call it, and this is hugely influential. The atomic parts, the individuals have surprising little to do with the action of the collective. A small inclination or tilt on the part of a large group of people can cause unexpectedly large effects, take on a whole other significance.<br /><br />To me, the important thing is to figure out the correct configuration for society. Then we&#039;ll have the strong, intelligent, brave system participants you desire.<br /><br />I appreciate that the government is not a single entity, that it&#039;s a composition, a network, but it doesn&#039;t mean those network agents are the statistical average of the people within those agencies, I don&#039;t think social organization works that way. This is mostly because of the division of labor with ideas. If I take 1 physicist and put him in a building, he bounces his ideas off nobody but himself through introspection. If I take 10 physicists and put them in the same room, I expect to see a dramatic increase in the development of their ideas, not just 10x as much. Compilations of collective thoughts (memeplexes) accumulate in an accumulative manner, not an additive one. So an organization with twice as many members, is not twice as complex, but many times more complex.

				I&#039;m high and in a chatty mood so I&#039;m going to make some points and defend my desire to want to move to Mexico as well.<br /><br />Why I want to move to Mexico:<br />1. Firstly, you must not trust the media representations of what life in Mexico is like. They are grossly exaggerated. Drug trade violence is concentrated around the border. Most other places in Mexico are actually SAFER crime-wise than US places if you look at statistics.<br />2. The police are lenient and bribable (keep 100 peso notes handy). As the great Rothbard said, corruption (and bribery) greases the wheels of trade. Its NOT automatically a bad thing. They are also less&nbsp; militarized and more friendly. When I look in the mirror and see a cop behind me, I feel FEAR. They are a thousand ways this thug can screw you over if he feels like it, and you&#039;re totally at his/her mercy.<br />3. Superior culture. There is no busybody culture in Mexico. Live and let live. If some dude is riding down the street on his unlicensed dirtbike, he&#039;s not gonna have the SWAT truck on his ass in 5 minutes (ok im exaggerating slightly here, but you get the point)<br />4. Check out Jeff Berwick&#039;s articles (he has a website called dollar vigilante) on living in Mexico. He is an anarcho-capitalist like myself and loves it there.<br />5. I am an (aspiring) computer programmer and will be able to work from home and probably avoid most taxes.<br />6. I&#039;d also happily consider Thailand and maybe a few other countries like Argentina.<br /><br />The people posting here you really enjoy living in America: Thats fine, I respect your opinion and can even understand where you&#039;re coming from. But, these are also people who have more than likely spent their entire lives here though, and don&#039;t know any different. And haven&#039;t ever been arrested or had the hugely unfortunate experience of going through the court system for some BS charge. And to me that is a huge mistake! I want to travel all over. There is so much more to the world than America. And the culture of obedience, patriotism, religiosity, national arrogance (sometimes called American Exceptionalism. which means we are the greatest because we say so, na na na not listening). As well as the focus on &quot;bread and circuses&quot; like mindless TV reality shows and sports worship. <br /><br />Thankfully I still have friends here that can tolerate my being so different lol. <br /><br />In closing, everyone must choose their own path. The cornerstone of liberty is tolerance of others personal choices.

				I do not share all this pessimism.&nbsp; I do see all the injustice and control.&nbsp; I see and feel the struggles of the middle class.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be a millionaire.&nbsp; I jumped through all the hoops and graduated from college and then worked and got a masters at the same time.&nbsp; I do not feel as though I am owed or that I have been lied to.&nbsp; Perhaps it is because my parents immigrated here.<br /><br />I have kids, a job, a house and a dog.&nbsp; I have access to food, water and every other convenience imaginable.&nbsp; I am never uncomfortable when it&#039;s hot outside.&nbsp; I am warm when it&#039;s cold.&nbsp; I have 200+ TV channels.&nbsp; I was given a free K-12 education - a good one.&nbsp; I was not given a job.&nbsp; I had to earn a job.&nbsp; I do not believe the USA is a true meritocracy, but I think there is more class mobility here than in most other countries.<br /><br />Long ago (or not so long ago) people relied on their neighbors and family to survive.&nbsp; Now, we have everything we need at the push of a button (or mouse click).&nbsp; Yet, we are unsatisfied.&nbsp; Today, those social interconnections are not necessary for survival.&nbsp; The result?&nbsp; Less sharing and a more &quot;all for one&quot; attitude.&nbsp; A complete lack of sympathy/empathy for others - and certainly NO forgiveness.&nbsp; A judgmental society that discounts the value of human connections.&nbsp; I got mine, you go get yours.&nbsp; A lack of respect for people who have earned their way up - even if some of it was luck.&nbsp; Judging your self-worth by comparing your net worth to others.&nbsp; Lacking an interest in investigating facts - this is a biggie, because so many attitudes (including those above) are not based in fact.&nbsp; It&#039;s all perspective people.<br /><br />Yes, our government is out of control and we elect idiots that think a woman&#039;s body can prevent a rape pregnancy - and worse.&nbsp; But living here is not bad.&nbsp; Being part of the American society is not bad.&nbsp; Taking advantage of all America has to offer is not bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />For those of you who want to move to another country, I think you are in for a rude awakening.&nbsp;

				Personally, I feel that the USA is in a downward spiral that is about to repeat itself again. I won&#039;t say much as to not give away info that could be linked together, but these &quot;Liar Loans&quot; aka mortgage loans with no proof of income are making a HUGE comeback again. I personally watched the first wave go through and left the banking industry due to the next wave of ethics conflicts that I was not ok with any longer. Currently working to create a wildlife preserve in a south american country to become self sufficient and run an ecolodge with local materials and foods. America needs to wake up and realize this cycle is about to come back with a vengeance after all the homeowner helping programs such as HAMP go away with the 2013 year start. In private meetings we were told that foreclosures within those loans will skyrocket soon. I advice any vendors with mortgages to please pay them off as soon as you can. Funny enough on my research of foreclosures 100% of them happened on a house with a mortgage lol&nbsp; :P

				Okay I&#039;ll give this an attempt.<br /><br />First of all there is no such thing as &quot;America&quot;. The term &quot;America&quot; can refer to the United States of America (a country), North America (The continent that includes USA, Mexico, Canada), South America (The continent that includes Columbia, Brazil, Argentina) or both of these continents. <br /><br />I am going to make the assumption that you are referring to the country: United States of America. In which case: What exactly is it you want my opinion on? The geographical landmass that makes up the country? The proximately 310 million people that inhabit this geographical place? The government that controls the political affairs of the country? The culture? The country as a whole?<br /><br />Ok I&#039;ll admit that I am being overly dainty so let me attempt to give you the kind of answer I presume you are looking for.<br /><br />There are some really great Americans, unfortunately from a general perspective the majority of the general population seem overly naive, possess a sense of self worth beyond anything you will find in other countries (the phrase&quot;You can&#039;t do this to me, I&#039;m an American&quot; springs to mind, something you would hear a US citizen yell whilst being held in a thai prison after doing something wrong) most annoyingly though: extremely uneducated about the world around them. <br /><br />The following quote springs to mind:<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Only in America can you be pro-death penalty, pro-war, pro-unmanned drone bombs, pro-nuclear weapons,﻿ pro-guns, pro-torture, pro-land mines, and still call yourself ‘pro-life.’&quot; - John Fugelsang </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Now sure I am generalizing a lot, but the point I am trying to get across is that very specific american-train-of-thought. If anyone has watched the film &quot;God Bless America&quot; it highlights a similar point. Anyway, for me personally this is the fundamental aspect I think of when someone says &quot;America&quot;. It&#039;s a shame. I don&#039;t blame the people or anyone in particular, it&#039;s just the way it is. Any &#039;American&#039; that tries to be different would become an outcast, and who wants to be an outcast in your own country? <br /><br />It&#039;s a combination of many things that contribute to this and like I said I don&#039;t blame anyone. Instead I adopt a very simple outlook when it comes to this: Assess each person as an individual regardless of race, nationality, citizenship etc. <br /><br />And even those &#039;Americans&#039; that are idiots, I don&#039;t blame them. They are just a product of their own corrupt educational system and the way they were raised. Everyone is simply a product of their environment. <br /><br />So to sum up: I don&#039;t think anything in particular about &#039;America&#039; as really there is no such thing.

				I&#039;ve been to England, France, Spain, and Italy. It&#039;s not that I didnt like their culture, I just didnt like being profiled as an American. You could tell at like restaurants especially, like as soon as they hear the accent you just see their face go blank. Not that they are rude, they just dont really help you either.<br /><br />Idk, England&#039;s food was pretty awful, maybe I just was at the wrong spots but idk how they eat and enjoy it. No hot sauce at KFC? I almost laughed in the cashier&#039;s face when he went &quot;Would you like ketchup instead?&quot;<br /><br />I am very polite in person and left good tips regardless of the service so hopefully I put the USA in a good light.

				I&#039;ve lived in America. I watched 9/11 from across the harbour in Staten Island. Blah.blah, blah ... I think Americans became too insular and apathetic - because of it&#039;s progress in becoming the world&#039;s economic and military superpower. Now the tables have turned. Most of it was a sham. Greed took control (banks, finance co&#039;s) and bad governments wasted taxpayers money on killing innocent people in other countries. I feel such compassion for so-called &#039;everyday&#039; Americans because they have to suffer the sins of their father as your government&#039;s &#039;bad karma&#039; plays out its roll in the coming decades. But there is still hope if more great souls, like some of its founding fathers try to right the wrongs. Barrack Obama has been a great caretaker for America imo. I hope people like him can keep nudging out the power-mongering billionaire phoneys that are trying to take control of your blessed country.<br /><br />simulacra

				I once was having a discussion with someone and told them I wasn&#039;t proud to be an American, not because I had anything against America, but because I simply didn&#039;t like the idea of Nationalism. Their response was to punch me and yell angrily. Last year in high school, I didn&#039;t stand up for the Pledge of Allegiance, because, again, Nationalism is stupid. The principle happened to see this and then, during one of the breaks, I got a call from my angry father about the matter. She even got the German foreign exchange kid to do the pledge I think that pretty much sums it up here. <br /><br />I don&#039;t get why everyone always talks bad about our education system. While there&#039;s a lot of aspects in which it&#039;s militarized, discourages independent thinking, underefunded, and broken in about a million different ways, you still learn quite a bit if you&#039;re motivated to do so; it&#039;s certainly a far cry from third-world-ness as a lot of people seem to think it isn&#039;t. <br /><br />European countries, I have a few questions for you: how&#039;s the situation with nationalism in your countries; how do you look at America; does the prevalence of Nationslism here have anything to do with the negative outlook; what&#039;s the situation in your countries about stupid shit that should be obvious like cannbis legality, pro-choice, and gay marriage?

I didn&#039;t say every American is stupid and ignorant did I? I would bet any amount of money that if you do a survey where you ask American children and European children questions about things outside their country, the European children would be consistently more educated about the world around them. Whenever I see a really stupid comment on Youtube 9 times out of 10 it&#039;s by an American.<br /><br />Come on man, the &quot;You&#039;re just jealous, we saved you in the war&quot; bullshit is just immature :P Sure America has achieved and created a lot of things but at what cost? You are consuming insane amounts of energy, polluting the atmosphere etc. etc. example:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita If I had the time and energy I could go on and link a lot more statistics. <br /><br />Also remember that Europe is OLD, a lot of the wars and disputes between countries go back many centuries, during a time when that sort of thing was essential for your nation to prosper. If you take into account how young America is I think you&#039;ll find you&#039;ve caused a lot more trouble on average. You&#039;re like the new kid at school who starts arguments and fights and think you&#039;re it just to try and fit in, and everyone else just wants you to chill the hell out. <br /><br />You make another good point, the amount of religious nutjobs you have is insane, religion is OBSOLETE but still your presidents talks about god and shit, seriously? By ultra conservative I mean the approximately 40% that voted Republican, against abortion even if a woman is raped? Seriously gtfo haha, I don&#039;t even know how to argue against these sort of ideas because they haven&#039;t existed for many decades where I&#039;m from.<br /><br />http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-16386176<br /><br />&quot;In the last week Rick Perry has announced he is against abortion, even when a woman has been raped and put out an ad claiming Obama was waging war on Christianity. Ron Paul has been endorsed by a preacher who advocates the death penalty for homosexuality. Michele Bachmann says that under Biblical instruction she would be submissive to her husband, even as president.&quot; <br /><br />Is this stuff actually real? Maybe I need to actually visit America to get a better picture but I find it hard to believe that the BBC is making this stuff up. Don&#039;t you see how insane it is? (Although I have to admit, I don&#039;t know what biblical instruction means but that thing about submission under biblical instruction sounds hot, man I bet she&#039;s nasty in bed)<br /><br />I feel like I am digressing, I&#039;ll try and simplify it. There is an essence that the majority of Americans seem to posses that I absolutely hate and despise, take a look at this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAU6S6ke36o (Just google &quot;American reactions to bin laden death&quot; if you don&#039;t want to follow clearnet link) I ask you: Do you support this kind of behavior? I mean it&#039;s 2012, Americans claim to be the best, the most developed, the most modern but still you go out on the streets and celebrate the death of another human being? His death means nothing.<br /><br />Again, I mean nothing negative, I like a lot of Americans, I really do, as a whole though I can&#039;t stand a lot of them. <br /><br />Sorry if I didn&#039;t meet all your arguments but this debate is getting way too broad for being on an underground black market forum ;P

It&#039;s not about the good guys or the bad guys, it&#039;s about idiotic backward thinking that belongs in the 1800s. FUCK THE REPUBLICANS. Both parties are equally shit but the republicans are the fucking scum of the earth. Americans should know better.

Although even the so called &#039;good southerners&#039; are most likely religious and very conservative (against abortion, against gay marriage, likely racist, etc.) They&#039;re only friendly if you&#039;re a white, straight heterosexual with not too liberal views. <br /><br />I remember seeing an episode of the British Top Gear where they drove through Alabama and I saw many examples of the stereotypical backward thinking white trash people. Check this out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jG0D2nRGrQ (Google: Extra: &quot;Top Gear&quot; in Alabama)<br /><br />I think you&#039;re being overly naive about your own country. This stuff wouldn&#039;t happen in Europe. Thank God I am not an American, no offense, honestly.

				I have a lot to say about America as a Russian immigrant. So here goes:<br /><br />I DESPISE when politicians do this:<br /><br />Interviewer (let&#039;s call him &quot;Anderson&quot;): &quot;So will you be favoring the rich and cutting taxes for them while making the middle class pay more and more?&quot;<br /><br />Candidate: &quot;I&#039;m sorry the crowd is going wild here, Anderson; I can&#039;t really hear you. But I do want to say one thing: This is THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD!!!&quot;&quot;<br /><br />Is anyone here familiar with THE PROTOCOLS OF THE LEARNED ELDERS OF ZION (http://www.aztlan.net/protocols.htm)??<br /><br />This was an anti-Semitic document fabricated by the Chaika (the Czar&#039;s secret police in late Imperial Russia). I am a Jew myself (half) so I take no offense to it and I hope no other Jews here do as well. Now, let&#039;s take out all the Jewish aspects of it and replace it with the American government. Let&#039;s take out the communist conspiracy aspects as well. Is this document not describing EXACTLY what is happening in America today??<br /><br />Did you all know that states where Republicans are governors have cut state university funding by almost 90%!! They want us to be dumber. But I will say this: the crazy-jesus-camp-speaking-in-tongues-psycho-fucks are losing power. And that is refreshing. <br /><br />Do I hate America? No. As a matter of fact, every time I travel for a week or two to a foreign country I am always happy to be back in my home country. I live comfortably, admittedly. The only place where I did not want to return from was the Netherlands. They got their shit together like no other country.<br /><br />I also live in America&#039;s biggest city; i interact with races and cultures from all over the world. I love my city. However, I have been to Alabama, Arkansas, and many other states on a road-trip across the U.S., and I can easily say this country contains the STUPIDEST and MOST RELIGIOUS DUMB FUCKS in the world. When asked if I was a Christian, I responded: &quot;Russian Orthodox, yes.&quot; To which the man answered &quot;what the fuck kinda Jewy dumb shit is that? That aint no gosh darn Christian!&quot;<br /><br />Because we do not have a federal education system, American will remain retarded, except for the rich states such as Cali, NY, and a few others.&nbsp; <br /><br />

Food is cheap, motels are cheap, petrol is cheap car rental was pretty cheap as well. My countries currency is very strong against the dollars so it feels like I&#039;d get a lot for my money. Would one get an accurate view of the US as a country if one were to do this? That is mostly what I&#039;m after. It feels like when you go on holiday to a country you don&#039;t really get an accurate view of the country as you&#039;re just a tourist. If you were to drive around, stay in different motels in different states, go into normal shops in non tourists areas and do things like that, it would be the best way to get an accurate picture without actually living there.<br /><br />I feel like its only right for me to go there and build my own view as most of my views about the US is based on things I read or see in films/online.

				Sigh.&nbsp; I&#039;m afraid there are hillbillies everywhere.<br />Even in Europe.<br />I beleive in the UK they have several breeds, Gypsies being the most obvious.<br />Check out all the hilarious YouTube videos of Russians doing hillbilly things.<br />I know a guy from India, and he says, even they have their form of hillbillies.<br />So, while I think Western culture is catering to the lowest common denominator in television and music, I also think there is much good in our society if you look at it more objectively.<br />Europe isn&#039;t the bastion of culture and sensibility they like to portray to the Americas, we all have a melting pot of various ethnicities and economic status&#039; to make things interesting.<br />The media just likes to focus on some things to make money and create influence.&nbsp; When we watch TV about the UK, it&#039;s all Royal this and Becks that, and the Netherlands has nothing to offer but potheads and flowers. I think the media and our weird ideas about the media help create and enforce these stereotypes.<br />Think about that Gingam Style song that is collectively making us all want to tear our ears out... the only reason it &quot;went viral&quot; is because the media announced it as &quot;the latest viral hit&quot; and then proceeded to play it day in and day out.<br />I know I didn&#039;t choose to listen to it 50,00 times a day, but the media says it&#039;s a hit, so it is.<br /><br />That being said, there are many who buy into the media hype and practically worship it.&nbsp; I think these are the hillbillies we have in the Americas.&nbsp; The ones who want to BE Homer Simpson.&nbsp; I don&#039;t doubt that there are some communities where these people are packed together, I could see wanting to move if my neighborhood starts going downhill with random acts of redneck.

				I&#039;ve been to the US a few times and recently as well.<br /><br />Politics in the US seems really divisive.&nbsp; It&#039;s happening here to, where the Left is becoming more centre-right, and the Right is becoming......downright creepy.&nbsp; Unlike here however, there doesn&#039;t seem to be a shift to more left wing thinking either (except for 7 people in a flat in Portland ;) )<br /><br />The baggage of the US zeitgeist seems really heavy at the moment.<br /><br />However, there are fantastic parts about US culture.&nbsp; When you go there, you feel like anything is possible (in a good way).&nbsp; People are super friendly and helpful, and contextually in-country their outgoing verbose nature really works to their advantage.&nbsp; Yanks know how to get shit done.<br /><br />I like the place and people stacks more than I ever thought I would.<br /><br />Their microbrewers are fucking awesome, too.&nbsp; ;D

Many people look at this site and frown upon it saying that we are the downfall of humanity, just a bunch of addicts. While I am sure there are some people struggling with addiction here, I guarantee that the majority of us are here to better ourselves and help others do so in a free thinking tribal environment. Its communities like this one that we can start to shift the current paradigm and get the pendulum to swing back to the side of the people.&nbsp;

				The pledge of allegiance is completely optional, that being said I don&#039;t remember anyone choosing to not say it all the way up until high school(9th-12th grade), and even then 99% of kids said it everyday, because it was just engrained in us as something we were taught to do at a very young age. but yeah America is not going to be able to survive much longer (10-15 years MAX) if we keep up they way we are.

				I think I can give a kind of different perspective seeing how im from the 49th state up north as seen in many shows on the discovery channel, Alaska. Up here the people are completely different then down in the lower 48 as we call it (i know cause i grew up in AK and im down on the east coast for school). Up in the far north people are much more laid back and liberal, much like Cali. Our drug laws are not as intense, just as much people blow tree as cigarettes. All and all I wouldnt trade living in AK for anywhere else in the world. However I do not like how our government is being run, at all. Too much of our politics is about making sure the president stays in office by offering things to illegal immigrants, and other bullshit policies that benefit freeloaders at the price of middle-class american citizens who work hard for their money and yes I&#039;m talking about you Mr. Obama. The US is slowly coming to an end like all other great empires such as Rome, sad part is when our economy crashes we&#039;ll be bringing down the worlds economy as a whole, sorry about that. Honestly I would like to move to Europe in the mountains, cause who doesnt love a good mountain top smoke sesh. Europe, keep up your amazing drugs and great music. I might be seeing ya&#039;ll soon!

				All developed nations become the same in fairly short order.&nbsp; The powerful will leverage their power to get money, and the rich will leverage their wealth to get power.&nbsp; You have the politicians selling their power and the rich buying it.&nbsp; Both sides get what they want and both sides consistently leave the people out in the cold.&nbsp; &quot;Capitalism: A love story&quot; tells the story from an American perspective but a similar movie could be written about any country in western Europe.<br /><br />In southeast Asia you have amateurs running the governments and this is a good thing.&nbsp; Corruption is systemic in both developed and developing countries, but in developing countries the power of the wealthy and the politicians is not yet all-encompassing.&nbsp; When a new law is made just weigh it.&nbsp; Put the pages on a scale.&nbsp; That will tell you how much power is being transferred from the people to the government and the corporations.&nbsp; The ten commandments could be written on a chalkboard, or you can put that old &quot;All I needed to know I learned in Kindergarten&quot; on a poster.&nbsp; Those will never do.&nbsp; Complexity breeds infection.&nbsp; If new laws were limited to a gram or less it would fundamentally change the way people are governed.&nbsp; How many sheets of paper in a gram?&nbsp; Plenty to make transparent laws.&nbsp; No space to hide the pathogens of government or the corporate world.&nbsp; Look at the tax code in any developed country.&nbsp; It is always written to protect corporations and politicians.&nbsp; They are always the authors.

				The country has a lot of flaws, and I would say that most of them are cultural. We&#039;re a first world country that is still ruled by ignorance and religious zealotry. I still have to say that I like living here though, there&#039;s really only one or two other countries that I would even consider living in permanently. Yes, I have traveled outside of the country. <br /><br />As for the thing about the pledge in schools: I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything that actually mandates that, and it certainly isn&#039;t mandatory. I went to several different public schools and a private school. In elementary school we would do the whole pledge+hand on heart+national anthem bullshit. In the private school (7th grade) we didn&#039;t do anything of the sort. When I got to HS they would just have someone read the pledge over the loudspeaker before the morning announcements, and in my other HS I do not recall doing that.

				As a Washington citizen, I find it very funny that everyone forgot how to conduct themselves in a manner befitting the once greatest union on the planet. People now adays do not know the difference between state and us citizens, or how to operate under their own capacity and not that of the state or the national government. SR seems to be a way back to having the ability to conduct private business in a private manner without need of title or license. That&#039;s my two cents. Thanks for reading.

We&#039;re no longer &quot;For the People&quot; but &quot;For the Interests of Return&quot;. It&#039;s not like America invented the idea although. Since Athens discovered large deposits of Silver in their region during times of the Greek city-states; people were enslaved to mine it. It&#039;s just now we have the internet and an ability to expose the tyranny of Colonialism (The extraction of resources and wealth of regions that do not benefit the native people). What the U.S. engages in now is Neo-Colonialism which instead of &quot;occupation&quot; like Early century British, French and Spanish empires, it uses economic and more discreet measures of control.<br /><br />Foreign Aid is a key term that means propping up radical and corrupt regimes in countries that will accept bribes to continue the plundering of their resources. Take Iran in 1951 where the U.S. CIA overthrew a democratically elected president in order to get someone in power that would give us unchecked access to Oil reserves. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn&#039;t. <br /><br />1954 In Guatemala, nearly half (42%) of the agriculture land ownership was from the Rockefeller family in the U.S. who, in conjunction, owned United Fruit Co. -- When the Guatemalan government decided to give the land back to it&#039;s poorest people and allow them to grow food for themselves, the CIA started an anit-communist movement within the country killing hundreds and throwing their Gov&#039;t in disarray. <br /><br />If you look at any successful country&#039;s history, you&#039;ll see Corporation walking hand in hand with the term Empire. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				What I think of America as a whole is: that it&#039;s bunch of land spanning much of the Western Hemisphere, to include North America, South America, and the Caribbean. I&#039;m not trying to be cheeky by sharing a literal approach to the term, because it illustrates hegemonic, exceptionalist perspectives that are too pervasive in the U.S.<br /><br />United Statsians too quickly dismiss as irrelevant or unimportant things that can be learned by examining how shit gets done elsewhere, and the lessons of history. Capitalism has become our form of government at this point, and its collapse/increased decline will cause major turmoil here. We are becoming better critical thinkers, imo, and there&#039;s a major clash right now between the rational-minded people who really believe in liberty, and the Manifest Destiny types that feel that we are seated at the center of the universe (who, coincidentally[?], are the ones who always invoke liberty).<br /><br />All of this is oversimplified, but a question like this invites only irresponsibly overgeneral responses. And I&#039;m glad to share mine!

D Rockefeller founded the General Education Board and (more than likely) influenced the laws for Compulsory Education through out America which allowed the Gov&#039;t to fine and even detach the parents from their children in a forced education agenda. Reasoning behind Rockefeller &quot;investment&quot; into Education can be derived by some quotes.<br /><br />“In our dream we have limitless resources, and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hand.&nbsp; The present educational conventions fade from our minds; and, unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk.&nbsp; We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science.&nbsp; We are not to raise up among them authors, orators, poets, or men of letters.&nbsp; We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians.&nbsp; Nor will we cherish even the humbler ambition to raise up from among them lawyers, doctors, preachers, statesmen, of whom we now have ample supply.&quot; <br /><br />- Rev. Frederick T. Gates, Business Advisor to John D. Rockefeller Sr., 1913

There are lots of benefits that are great living in the US, unfortunately just like every other society on earth there are some things that need to be changed. The American people are no less human than anyone else, trying their best to be civilized. Governments and massive organisations, however, do not always think of human emotions first and the people here must watch this activity closely. On another note I&#039;m tired of all the US bashing arising from victimization complexes and being the scapegoat for the evils of commercialism around the world.&nbsp; To cast the US as responsible for everything as some do is just plain bullshit.<br /><br />Anyways in general I enjoy the freedoms we still have here (always fighting for more) and it&#039;s generally a very stress free life for most. I said MOST so don&#039;t rip on me with your sad story and pretend it&#039;s the norm. You only have to travel to some countries to realize MOST have it well here and if you are working hard you are better off than the hopeless situation they are in.

				Three sentence preamble:&nbsp; My own family came here during the great potato famine and has yet to have any truly &#039;successful&#039; progeny. The vast majority of my life thus far has been in or around the bible belt. Most of that time has been centered around a city who&#039;s number one employer is a University heavily involved in the fine arts.<br /><br />&nbsp;The &#039;dream&#039; was made out to be something tangible here for the McCarthy era boomers. I am trying my best to stay away from any direct Floyd references..but the dream has changed, or more accurately, is in the process of changing. Almost all of the previous generations are tied to religious institutions here (as I can imagine is the same with the rest of the world) and therefor letting go of God and the commodity fetishism, elitism and blind nationalism that seems part and parcel of &#039;Murica and Church is a hard sell. They were promised wanton consumption. They worked and fought and bled for the right to &#039;take it easy&#039;. Now that they are FINALLY realizing that the world will never spin in that direction, without keeping 3/4ths of its population under heel, they are lost. Have you ever come across someone lost? They panic. They are scared. They are animals. My convoluted point is - &#039;people are people no matter where you are at.&#039; Yes, it is a disturbing/disgusting shame we have arrived here on the backs of so many decent and valiant hominids, but, to blame the new dare I say....enlightened? generation for the sins of our fathers is not fair and can/will not broker a sustainable peace. I have not read every post in this thread, just trying to add my two cents. My hopes it is seen in the light I intended it.

				I am an American. I live in a state all of the other states look at like all other countries look at America. In other words, I live in Texas.<br /><br />I am not very proud of being an American, even though I can trace my heritage directly to individuals who fought and died in the War of Independence, I have seen some of the things my country and its government has done in the people&#039;s name.<br /><br />I am sick of this country, and I am considering moving out of it, along with all of my family and friends.<br /><br />I am considering storing all of my wealth in Bitcoins which cannot be seized by the government, unlike bank accounts or credit cards, and Bitcoin is very easily portable, unlike gold or silver.<br /><br />I honestly hate this country, and the hypocrisy I observe in the national televised news and in public.<br /><br />If this country more honestly held to its principles and ideals, which are noble, that would be one thing, but all this country cares about is living comfortable at the expense of everyone else, especially non-Americans, and that is not what my adoptive parents taught me.<br /><br />America used to be a country about freedom, about self-empowerment, about being able to forge your own path, and work for a comfortable life on an even playing field.<br /><br />Now? If you were not born to a family who is already multi-billionaires, you will never achieve it. It is impossible, no matter how hard you work, and education is denied you, freedoms of every kind are denied you, and the military is now primed to fire upon their own citizens.<br /><br />This country is tattered and ruined, and it isn&#039;t coming back.<br /><br />America is dead.

				raynardine, I have to agree with a large part of your last post - opportunity has been taken away for many americans, both as far as wealth and certainly education. We are not together on much, a result, or even a freedom or sorts, of an open society. I do hate the way people are led / allowed to be led by the retoriticians in the media: they let their opinions be formed for them by Bill O&#039;Reilly or some other ass (no one thinks for themselves). <br />We are too materialistic and chase all the wrong things in life, forgetting in the process of how to simply enjoy life. Then there&#039;s the F*&amp;^%$ government - human language fails me to describe that miserable bunch of losers. Special interest groups run the country, this seems obvious when watching Congress&#039; inaction on everything (except giving themselves pay raises).<br /><br />I have considered what country to run to, but I am not sure of any good options (W. Canada in the woods? Denmark? Scananavia?)<br />One question for you, raynardine, are you origionally from Texas, or living here as am I?

				The American dream used to be a thing everyone wanted to attain, now, America is described as the best democracy money can buy. The dream has turned into a nightmare as Big Brother intimidates people into submission, overtaxing, spying, gathering intel on percieved threats to their agenda.&nbsp; The corporations control the government, and who controls the corporations?&nbsp; There you have it.&nbsp; What I truly think about America is that its getting worse as the government tightens its grip over the population and continues to indoctrinate people to their company line.&nbsp; Those who are aware of the governments agenda and who publicly speak out become targets.&nbsp; Forums like this are important to inform and share information while protecting identity.&nbsp; I think America would be a much better place to live without all the government control.

				Whether America is the greatest country in the world or not, if you are going to complain about it, just leave. We don&#039;t want you here if you hate it. I am not saying by any means that we do everything right, or we don&#039;t have some imperialistic or maybe even just mean policies, but you you are one of us and all you have is negativity I am sure their are many countries that will take you.<br />Its like if you let someone stay in your house and all they can do is criticize you, your rules, and your house.

The crime typically takes place amongst other criminals but people get mugged from time to time. The political corruption is rampant someone in office or once in office is getting brought up on federal charges all the time.<br />And the cops are unbelievable. There is extreme police corruption you can read all about it in books and news articles. But with all of that negativity comes way more positivity.

				Interesting topic. As an American, I think there really is only one default answer to this question. You have to back the home team. You have to support America because it is your home, your country. For all it&#039;s warts and faults, this is the country which you grew up in, live in, and presumably choose to stay in. If you hold any other position besides being on the side of America, then I&#039;m sorry to sound colloquial, but it really is a case of love it or leave it. You have the freedom to move to any number of different societies where there are a myriad of possibilities of lifestyles, cultures, tastes, to explore. But if you choose to stay an American, then you have to stay loyal to America. This is not to say that everything in America is right or just. I for one think there are tons of things wrong in this country. But I never say there are tons of things wrong WITH this country. I choose to stay and choose to love it because, fundamentally America is the best place for me and my family. I have been to other countries, lived abroad, to good places and bad. I&#039;ve seen the possibilities this world offers. Yet, I continue to come back home. Whether this is a personal trait or whether this is due to America being a better place than other countries is definitely debatable. What is not debatable is the fact that if you choose to stay an American, then you have to love America. There is no other philosophically non-contradictary stance. Sorry to sound like the typical cocky American, but that is my stance and I&#039;m sticking to it. <br /><br />

Many, many people cannot afford to move. And regardless, it&#039;s not about deserting what you don&#039;t agree with, it&#039;s about fixing something that shouldn&#039;t have been broken in the first place. It&#039;s about getting the government to exist for the people, not to exist for it&#039;s own damn interests. It&#039;s a big decision to leave a country. It&#039;s not like the decision to walk out of a movie you hate -- there are actual losses and profits to be considered. Obviously the people who hate America, myself included, don&#039;t hate what America WAS, they hate what america has BECOME. People stay and hope for change, and it&#039;s still not here.

Consumption of all kinds is out of fucking control here. Oil, food, entertainemnt, etc. Even fucking drugs. We consume more than half of all illegal drugs in the world, then ban the sale of them and send the supply to Mexico where they terrorize the Mexican people while we sit all high and mighty over them acting good for throwing them a billion or two we borrowed from China to fight back at the cartels. We spark so much violence globally its truly a disgrace. Americans can accept responsibility for nothing!

America is a business, the whole world is a business. <br /><br />I&#039;m not trying to troll or anything, just saying that financial incentives and power are the things that dictate our lives.. not principals, or voting, or the constitution.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />^^^Agreed.&nbsp; People need to turn off their TV&#039;s and see the reality of what is coming.&nbsp; Voting is meaningless when they are controlled by the powerful...the numbers aren&#039;t real.&nbsp; Neither side, right or left (both complete shit) cares about The Constitution.&nbsp; We are being brainwashed and divided on purpose and most can&#039;t see it.&nbsp; Patriotism is NOT loving ones country (and especially not ones government), but loving FREEDOM within it.&nbsp; The Founders fought against their mother country in order to obtain that freedom...that is the very definition of Patriotism.&nbsp; Those who are seeing things with their eyes and not their hearts are going to be much better off when things really start to go south....and they will.&nbsp; &nbsp;Americans shouldn&#039;t be so concerned with terrorists in other countries or threat of war from other countries.&nbsp; They should be preparing for the war against the greatest and most powerful terrorists of all....the powers behind their own government.&nbsp;

				Sorry I totally disagree....... Voting is useless in the USA with regards to the Presidential races. Electoral college picks the president. We the people are given paper to write on to feel important. We MIGHT help in the process of the electoral college, but even that is a complete two party system that isn&#039;t going anywhere.

And it DOES matter in the primaries, especially for states that decide them using the caucus system.<br /><br />And do you know why the two parties play politics? Because there ARE key differences between the parties. They represent different constituencies, have different party platforms and ideologies, and are wooed by different lobbies. Sure there&#039;s naturally some crossover among the lobbyists but the roles they play and the prominence and influence they can buy when one party is in power as opposed to the other is limited even though there are a few exceptions.<br /><br />I have a hard time believing those that assume some sort of collusion is going on between the two parties to maintain the status quo actually understand how government works. Parties work to serve their own best interests, as that&#039;s the way the system was designed, and on a great many issues (though not all) the two major parties are diametrically opposed.<br /><br />

				As a European who has worked a summer in the US, I can safely say my impression of the US was very negative. It felt like a true police state. In my country, I have rarely witnessed people being arrested. In the US, that was almost a daily occurrence. US cops seem to have no common sense, no matter how insignificant the crime, they hurry up to put the cuffs on you. I have seen lots of cars being pulled over and searched (most likely for drugs), cops were everywhere. I&#039;ve seen senior high school kids speaking so proudly about their plans to join the army and go to Afghanistan, you had to show your ID for cigarettes and alcohol. Things that for an american may seem normal, just seemed excessive and unnecessary. It&#039;s just so ridiculous people call it land of the free. I&#039;ve been to quite a few countries, the US is the most unfree country I&#039;ve ever been to.

				I am American, and I fucking hate America. The whole reason America became independent of Britain was to enjoy freedom and liberty. Today, those things no longer exist. People think we posses these things, but we don&#039;t; they&#039;re just an illusion. We have no ability whatsoever to make choices for ourselves. The only freedom we have is paper or plastic, cream and sugar or black, smoking or non-smoking, etc. The media makes our decisions nowadays. Everyone has become so absorbed in to media and blindly accepts everything thrown their way. They don&#039;t bother to think where the media came up with the shit they spew and the legitimacy of it. Corporations give us no option of how to survive. We have to play by their rules in order to survive.<br /><br />Also, if America&#039;s takes so much pride in freedom and liberty, why can&#039;t I do anything without getting into legal trouble? If I do something that ONLY affects myself and NOBODY else, why should they give a fuck? I would understand if I got arrested for going around raping, killing, stealing, etc. But why the fuck should I get arrested for doing a drug? It&#039;s literally affecting nobody but myself.<br /><br />Americans wonder why every country in the world fucking hates them. Maybe it&#039;s because America goes around screaming &quot;We&#039;re the greatest country in the world! WOOO!&quot; America is filled with a bunch of war mongers. They feel obligated to go around the world and put a base on every fucking country&#039;s land even when they are not welcome. And then they wonder why all these country&#039;s are trying to kill us. It&#039;s because we fucking started it and they are just retaliating! <br /><br />Fuck.. this country pisses me off. I&#039;m leaving ASAP.

				In other words, a foreigner is asking you in your own language if you are happy. Are you, as an American--whether born and raised, migrated, or simply working in or visiting America--happy with your life and country?<br /><br />The answer to any logical person should be a resounding &quot;NO&quot;. Until a Utopia exists--thermodynamically impossible... like a perfect, ever-lasting crystal... although we can get really fucking close--then no one should be perfectly content with this question. The question is a deeply subconscious and emotional challenge to our health as a society. To be fair, it should be restructured to give the benefit of the doubt to any member of society within our human community called Earth.<br /><br />Anyways, I am personally happy most of the time, as long as I have food, shelter, water, freely available knowledge/education, prozac and cannabis. I stay out of trouble this way. I am nonviolent--and always will be. I would commit suicide before hurting others, although I have done that to some degree with my words... and attempts have been made.<br /><br />I am happy in America because there is always the possibility of changing America for a better tomorrow. America, like every democracy, is influenced by good and bad. It is the responsibility of the society members to participate and modify their local, state, and national legislature to accommodate for a changing society. The more technology we possess and invent, the more challenges there will be to social order. People don&#039;t like change, as goes for wealth old white men.... who are all the billionaires in the world? Are they all men? Are they all selfish? Human? Imperfect?<br /><br />All we need is better error-checking--like BTC--in every aspect of our lives, and peace will infect the world better than Small Pox or AIDS.

				You people make me sick.<br />People are just never happy, America is a great country. You want perfection and cannot have it because perfection does not exist. I love America, I am not rich at all have no stake in any large companies and while I disagree with some laws a majority are here to keep me safe. I really wish all of you Americans that hate America would just leave. There are plenty of people that would love to take your place.

				This is really interesting.<br /><br />I was born in Tacoma and left the States when I was 5. I didn&#039;t return until I was 16. I entered the country with my British passport. The immigration guy took one look and asked me if I had renounced my US citizenship. I replied &quot;err, no I don&#039;t think so, do I need to put that in writing?&quot;<br /><br />Faster than you can say Uncle Sam I&#039;m in a small room with a very Mexican looking immigration officer, a lady, who also happened to have balls many times larger than my own. Apparently when entering the US I need to use a US passport unless I officially give up my citizenship. And if I did give it up, I would be a piece of shit not worthy of entering. Enemy of the State #1. So now I have a US passport. I must say it saves a lot of time. They are one tough bunch those immigration officials. <br /><br />In fact I wish UK immigration was as tough but they&#039;ll let anyone in or it appears so. The UK could do with taking a few leaves from the US books of justice and immigration. LE on this side of the pond is soft as shit as inconsistent at best.
