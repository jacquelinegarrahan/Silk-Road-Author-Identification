			<dd class="postbody">
				What appears to project some LSD users into a temporary &#039;insanity&#039; is the cracking of their picture of themselves-- the disintegration of the ego. I have a certain idea of myself, and when that is destroyed -- or when the cornerstone is pulled down, then I am suddenly left adrift -- not knowing who I am, where I am, or what is reality.<br /><br />Now it is interesting to observe that not everyone seems to have to deal with the disintegration of the ego on the insane level. I have a hunch it is related to the temperament and defensive system of the individual involved. Those who must most strongly defend on the intellectual, controlled, rational level (against the other parts of themselves -- really against their own unconscious) seem to be the ones who are most likely to hit the skids in this direction. In examining myself, it seems to me that it was in some way related to fear -- fear of unreality, or of being alone -- of not existing, etc.<br /><br />That is, when it is experienced as insanity and not as symbolic hell or purgation. This latter gem comes to everyone some time....

				This is why it&#039;s best to know what the fuck you&#039;re getting into before doing it, and not to trust the conclusions you come to until after you have had ample time to investigate them. As you yourself have shown in multiple other threads, joywind, LSD can also lead us to make ridiculous and wholly unsupportable claims about the nature/purpose of existence.

				That would be odd indeed - LSD will temporarely change your view of things, but normally this change is not something that remains very long. Perhaos you would be more suitable to take something likt DMT however, also a potent hallucinogen but with a very short window of action.<br /><br />Personally i do not like hallucinate, but taking a short trip there using a substance like dmt will probably not affect you that much. Within an hour or so you will have experienced what is available, and if you dislike it you have the choice of not doing it again, ever.

				the cracking of my ego is exactly what happened prior to personal episodes of complete insanity on lsd.&nbsp; My mind became scattered to the point of unreality.&nbsp; I went insane,&nbsp; realized it, yet couldn&#039;t do anything consciously to regain reality again. <br /><br />My system shutdown physically when insanity attained a point of complete saturation.&nbsp; I became completely immobile, and even blacked out on lsd on few occasions.&nbsp; My bouts of insanity has always taken me to some type of personal hell; a place where a mirror of my soul is affixed to magnifying glass.&nbsp; I am then left alone, forced to judge my own hypocrisies.

				Wow! All those &quot;-isms&quot; and &quot;ists&quot;. I&#039;m an oldie but goodie, and took copious amounts of LSD in the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s, and only recently tried it again (now in my late 40&#039;s). - Those Albert Hoffmans from the Netherlands are some of the smoothest non-speedy LSD I&#039;ve ever tried. <br /><br />I go back to the days of Yellow-barrel, Orange-Sunshine, Purple-Haze, (or Purple microdot), and many others.<br /><br />Certain individuals, I&#039;ve learned, who are already predisposed to schizophrenia, or may even have a latency for the disease, ie;&nbsp; schizophrenia lay dormant in them, and may well have stayed that way, but the trauma of an intense acid trip, triggered that which lay below the surface. <br /><br />A few good friends never came back, very very sad. :( - Much like Syd Barrett - Founder of Pink Floyd. - My friend and I used to dare each other to take more. We once took 10 hits of Red Windowpane which was very strong shit that was around NYC in the early 80&#039;s. One night we took 4 hits of this Blue Moon BLotter, and I had the most intense trip ever. I literally ran home, and it was as if I were in a cartoon. I stood in my backyard, and the branches of an apple tree (in Winter) looked like a huge spider web, and of course &quot;along came the spider!&quot;&nbsp; Ahhh!!! <br /><br />I looked into the 6 pane bow window from the back of my parents house, and saw my parents watching TV, but there were 4 of each of them, each doing different things! <br /><br />I went round to the front door, and just yelled out &quot;I&#039;m home, I&#039;m going to bed&quot;. - Went to my room, got under the covers, and turned out the light. <br /><br />BIG Mistake! - I went right into a 6 hour Yellow Submarine/Peter Max cartoon land. - It was amazing and terrifying at the same time. <br /><br />My friend and I figure we had stronger minds than most. As our circle of friends disappeared, because we were &quot;too weird and took too much acid&quot; ..LoL <br /><br />We both led full lives later, married, kids, house, etc. Middle class suburban bliss. - Now both divorced, kids in college. We&#039;re starting to trip all over again! <br /><br />As far as beliefs go? I don&#039;t care what yours is, as long as it doesn&#039;t affect my life negatively, and what I believe doesn&#039;t really matter, does it? <br /><br />Just some ramblings from an old fool who was the little brother of a bunch of hippie chicks.&nbsp; 8)

I&#039;m perfectly willing to allow that the cosmos consists of both matter and nothingness, but you&#039;re going to have to do better than this if you&#039;re going to convince me that this necessitates an anthropocentric/morphic, singularly conscious god.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: joywind</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: abitpeckish</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I simply don&#039;t claim this, and will refuse to make this claim until I come across or am presented with evidence of such a claim.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>I simply don&#039;t claim the existence of matter, and will refuse to make this claim until I am presented with evidence for its existence.

				No, he said that there are no objective truths of reality because everything you call &quot;objective truth&quot; is filtered by your consciousness, so it is inevitably tied to subjectivity. What you call &quot;objective truth&quot; is just a group consensus built upon subjective parameters created for convenience by us as a specie, but there cannot be no objective truth in the real sense just because there&#039;s no way to come to an objective consensus about reality outside that subjective synthesis.

If you intend for it a mean for a certain specie as a group to function better in a given circumstance, then yes; the problem is when the group consensus meant for functionality becomes instead a dogma that replaces altogether the motive why that group consensus was adhered to to being with.<br /><br />As it is now in the majority of western thought the subjective consensus has become regarded as objective reality, and this pose as an obstacle instead than as an advantage meant for practical purposes (as it should be). Consider for example the internal world, imagination/hallucinations and in general the planes you can visit through the unconscious. These are considered by western thought as totally subjective (and so unreal) planes. Yet they participate of the same exact subjective nature of what it is instead labeled as objective &quot;reality&quot;, the only difference stands in that group consensus, that however, as we have already established, is based on subjective parameters in the same exact way.<br /><br />Yet what are considered &quot;subjective planes&quot; and &quot;unreal&quot; have in themselves the capability of creating in the same way a subjective group consensus (if researched upon), that, as a result, would create an &quot;objective reality&quot; out of them in the same exact way - as it happens in shamanic cultures, for example. The only motive why it doesn&#039;t happen in western thought it is just because of that approach based on purely arbitrary parameters that established that two subjective planes in the same exact way are considered one as &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;real&quot; and the other &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;unreal&quot; because of that group consensus (a *subjective* group consensus itself), that established as real and objective (for its functionality) what gives the *impression* of being external till this group consensus became a so strong dogma as to replace altogether its functional premise and become objective reality itself, hence blocking the experience and research of other possible similar group synthesis on which to base an &quot;objective reality&quot;.<br /><br />Another great drawback of the dogma is that in western cultures people are totally unaware of the premise of the dogma and as such they totally believe something completely subjective to being completely objective, hence obstructing their research of the truth for a thing that was NOT born for this. Even worse with their dogma they feed the dogma itself, hence literally turning into objective reality the world as it is for everyone (also if this concept it is too complicate to debate here).<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=167373.msg1223133#msg1223133">Quote from: abitpeckish on June 11, 2013, 12:15 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Even if this is true, why would that be the ONLY way to know objective truths?

It is only for the motive already mentioned that it has become in western thought the ONLY real plane existent, even if this makes no sense at all from a purely logical (and experiential - only that naturally in this case the experience comes from a much smaller group of people, and sometimes with completely different base cultures hence establishing a group consensus even more difficult - given the status of the things) point of view.<br /><br />And anyway what we consider our plane of existence and its nature is just, again, a subjective consensus; we don&#039;t know what this plane of existence REALLY is, just because we cannot go beyond the subjective filter that make us perceive it.

				Simply put, LSD makes me think. It makes me think about everything, and yeah, sometimes it makes me think about thinks completely illogically, but that isn&#039;t always bad. There are too many close minded people in this world when we need open minded thinkers. LSD helps me open my mind and think about things from a completely new perspective that sometimes contradicts reality. <br /><br />~PsychedelicSphere
