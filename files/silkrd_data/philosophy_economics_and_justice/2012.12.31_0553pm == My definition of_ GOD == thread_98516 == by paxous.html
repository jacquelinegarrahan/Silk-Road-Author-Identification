				God to me is just an idea, a concept. Of something that happens in reality. Like time. It isn&#039;t a beeing or a thing. Is just a concept.<br /><br />In every instant there are infinite possibilitys.<br />~<br />Example: john goes from place A to place B.<br />in that space in time, there are infinite variables. (will it get hit by a car, will it rain, will it be so f_cking high he doesnt remenbers the course)<br /><br />but then he gets to the place B.<br /><br />so everything that happened, could have happened alot diferent. because of all the variables in jonh&#039;s reality or destiny if you prefer.<br /><br />GOD is the force that chooses what happens in reality. from all the variables, only 1 combination happens, there for reality.<br />GOD is what takes variable x, with all possible things that could happend and set&#039;s what happens in reality.<br /><br />there for GOD is omnipresent, because you have variables in your reality all the time<br />omnipotent because there are variables in everything in live...<br />

				None of the above. God is transcendent to thought, immanent to experience. He can only be described by negation. He is nothing, but also the fullness of all experience.&nbsp; We do not know what God is. God Himself does not know what He is because He is not anything. Literally God is not, because He transcends being.<br /><br />Neither existence nor nonexistence as we understand it in the physical realm, applies to God; i.e., the Divine is abstract to the individual, beyond existing or not existing, and beyond conceptualization regarding the whole (one cannot say that God exists in the usual sense of the term; nor can we say that God is nonexistent).<br /><br />God is not conceptually defined in terms of space and location.<br /><br />God is not conceptually confined to assumptions based on time.

				Sadly, I used to unconsciously use the term god to however it best suited me to try to justify my existence and actions. Luckily for me reason set it in and now no evidence means no existence. I am pleased to see that many who are referring to as god in this thread may actually mean a heightened awareness of reality, as opposed to the angry sky fairy model or otherwise. I have felt a heightened sense of reality, yet do not attribute this to anything divine or supernatural. Rather,&nbsp; it seems to me just a different perspective on my awareness and involvement in a system of interactions. The absurdity that I can even be typing this in the first place.... we are apes after all.

				A story by Gibran Khalil from his book The Madman.<br /><br />The Three Ants<br /><br />Three ants met on the nose of a man who was asleep in the sun. And after they had saluted one another, each according to the custom of his tribe, they stood there conversing.<br /><br />The first ant said, “These hills and plains are the most barren I have known. I have searched all day for a grain of some sort, and there is none to be found.”<br /><br />Said the second ant, “I too have found nothing, though I have visited every nook and glade. This is, I believe, what my people call the soft, moving land where nothing grows.”<br /><br />Then the third ant raised his head and said, “My friends, we are standing now on the nose of the Supreme Ant, the mighty and infinite Ant, whose body is so great that we cannot see it, whose shadow is so vast that we cannot trace it, whose voice is so loud that we cannot hear it; and He is omnipresent.”<br /><br />When the third ant spoke thus the other ants looked at each other and laughed.<br /><br />At that moment the man moved and in his sleep raised his hand and scratched his nose, and the three ants were crushed.
