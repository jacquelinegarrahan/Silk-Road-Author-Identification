				I am very proud to be of a generation that harbored and was born into a world were the Internet came into fruition. I believe it is on par, if not exceeds, some of the great World Wonders of human ingenuity. Be it for good or ill - the Internet has allowed millions of people to share thoughts, connect without physical barriers, become researched and even experts in any field they desire and show off their genitals. <br /><br />But from all the good that the Internet has done; has it also increased the depravity of the human experience?<br /><br />The easiest example is from a sexual standpoint. Has being able to completely fulfill any curiosity and deviant desire increased the amount of desensitized and predatorial adults and even young adults. In times without the internet, should you have a sexual thought that was far from mainstream acceptable - your choice was to actively find ways to express these thoughts to others face to face; or squander this desire and move on. With the advent of the internet, not only can you find release for 8 hours a day exposing and exploring these carnal desires, but you can connect anonymously to other people that share the same ideas. <br /><br />When you are dealing with even the most awful of taboo ideas, being able to find solace and others to reinforce the line of thinking can be dangerous. Or is the human connection beautiful? Eye of the beholder I guess. <br /><br />There are well documented and historical atrocities throughout the timeline of human civilization. Is it that evil has always been there and we now live in an age where everyone and anyone can report and upload or has the creation of the Internet increased the amount of evil by allowing harmless thoughts turn into action with the reinforcement of mob mentality. <br /><br />I guess you could argue that Guns don&#039;t kill people - its the finger. Maybe our monkey brains weren&#039;t meant to have too much time thinking. <br />

				The worst thing about the internet is how it has isolated people and weakened communities.&nbsp; I go out to eat and it seems like everyone is on their phone, it&#039;s like the people you chose to go out with aren&#039;t entertaining enough for you.&nbsp; People can&#039;t sit and talk over coffee for an hour anymore without checking for texts, tweets, status updates, emails, etc.<br /><br />It is like the computers are replacing people.&nbsp; If you think about it, it&#039;s pretty frightening.

It is merely a tool to be used by people. If someone goes online and finds child porn, it is for the most part because they went looking for it. The internet itself did not increase evil, it was just used in an unsavory fashion.<br />I guess my point is, if the internet were to be used for taboo purposes, the immorality was there to begin with, and it would have been there regardless of the existence of the internet.

				The internet is the only place where you can be &quot;free&quot; to an extent, it creates serious egomaniacs too though, all these facebook ugly duckfacing bitches and the &quot;i just took a shit the size of an anaconda,,,,, lolzzzz&quot; obsessed assholes are a prime example of that. <br /><br />There are plenty of posters on here who you can psycho analyze to be total internet addicted asoical creeps too though :)

				Evil/good is no different then energy, some is destructive some creative but it cannot be increased or decreased though it seems to do so at times. <br /><br />Throughout history what is evil has changed by definition many times. Such is the way of things, I for one detest child porn lovers and rapists/murderers- however, there are societies where having little boys as &quot;sex toys/workers&quot; is embraced...etc., I choose where I live, what I do, and that is what it is. <br /><br />;)

				Internet is not evil.. some people that use it are evil, anyway the concept of &quot;good or evil&quot; is just bullshit. Who decides what is good or evil? Do you think you are an evil people because you are buying drugs online? You can say no but if you ask to a non-drug user he will probably think you are evil. I think that concept is just another religion bullshit...

Dead on that point though, at the minimum I find it incredibly rude people are checking texts whilst I am talking to them, I see it as no different than to trying to listen to 2 people talking at the same time, diverted attention.<br /><br />Nothing better than having a real fireplace, wood burning, it&#039;s snowy and freezing outside and you can sit on a warm chair or even the floor next to the fireplace with a nice cup of hot chocolate (yeah, tea/coffee just doesn&#039;t cut it for me). Nice feeling.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree with this. And for me personally, the internet is a distraction. It&#039;s not that I&#039;m addicted to the internet because I have no problems living without it for a month, but it is that I use it for escapism. When I am going to study and I don&#039;t feel like it I go to the internet, because it has the ability to completely let me forget about studying for a while. It also has the ability to let me replace social interaction with real friends with social interaction with chat buddies. When I need a friend the chat buddy won&#039;t be there for me, but a real life friend will, so that&#039;s also something to watch out about.

				People are who they are and pedophiles are pedophiles. Pedophiles existed before the internet and they had to circle the schoolyard and reel in children to get their kicks. Now they can sit in their basement and jerk off all day long. Let them stay there.<br />Doug Stanhope anyone? <br />http://youtu.be/OlvNQQmsuFw<br />Anyways, internet might propagate a small amount of evil, but it probably prevents more than it creates.

It began in Eden when the Serpent told Adam and Eve they (mostly Eve; she gave a bite to Adam) could eat from the Tree of Knowledge and become God themselves. It is then that they no longer served God, but served themselves and Sin was born. Being greedy, lazy, lustful, jealous can all be justified from selfishness. I don&#039;t believe a lot of religious psalms and concepts, but figuratively that one from Genesis makes a lot of sense to me.

				Sure, the Internet increases evil. I wouldn&#039;t say it IS evil, but it certainly increases it.<br />It also increases knowledge, commerce and communications. Probably increases &#039;goodness&#039; too.

				I don&#039;t know evil, all I know is who my enemies are. I could care less about what people masturbate to.&nbsp; None of that bothers me.
