				Everyone is aware of the huge btc crash that occurred. Caused by someone dumping a massive amount into the market at far below market price, but even worse, the crash was fueled by scared holders of bitcoins trying to get rid of them. I personally was holding onto about 30 coins I was planning to use soon, so at this point they have devalued by a couple thousand dollars, but I have faith they will rise again.<br /><br /><br />This is what REALLY happen to cause the crash. Somebody, presumably wealthy bankers, bought millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. They then dumped them a week or 2 later at LOWER prices than they got them. This caused a major crash. They LOST money in doing this, but the result of their actions was causing everybody to lose some faith in the bitcoin. Mainly because too many people don&#039;t understand HOW bitcoin works or WHAT caused the crash. <br /><br />What they did, was essentially what I have coined, Economic Terrorism. At the cost of their money they have caused chaos and turmoil in the btc market. You would see a similar effect if billions of dollars were given for free to thousands of people in the US market. It is the reason why country wide money problems cannot be solved by just &quot;printing up more money&quot;. <br /><br />What occured regarding the bitcoins was NOT natural. It was caused by deliberate negative intentions of very wealthy people, and they basically paid for it. They lost money in doing it, just to disrupt the market. No rational bitcoin supporting person would ever do something like this, nor would a person looking to profit. Only a person bent on ruining the bitcoin market at the cost of their money.<br /><br />If you&#039;ve been paying attention to the news, anywhere, bitcoins are garnering a lot of attention. Not only that, so is the SilkRoad. This will inevitably bring new and more vendors to the SR, as well as more customers. It will also cause interest in Bitcoins to rise too. Bitcoins WILL be worth more the more people who use them. The more bitcoins there are in circulation the harder it will be for somebody to gain a large percentage of them and crash the market even if they wanted to.<br /><br />If you dump your bitcoins now you will loose money because they will be rising over thassumablye next week just from the sheer popularity increase. Don&#039;t let this economic terrorism from US bankers cause you to loose faith in the bitcoin, because that is exactly what they want. They cannot do this over and over again. They lost a lot of money just to cause this crash. <br />

				Is there any evidence to back this up?<br /><br />It sounds too conspiratorial to me. People have a hard time accepting that &quot;small&quot; people can do &quot;big&quot; things, so they come up with more profound explanations. A lone nut with a gun could not have shot the president, it must be the CIA. 19 guys with box cutters could not have brought down the WTC, it must have been the government. Some random hackers or market manipulators couldn&#039;t crash bitcoin, it must be the central banks.<br /><br />The truth is that we live in a world where insignificant people can sometimes have a significant impact on history.<br /><br />Then again, if you have evidence for this, I&#039;d love to see it.<br />

				This happens all the time.. Its not only Bitcoins..&nbsp; Its anything that pulls investors away from the US dollar.. This happened with silver as well. Its kind of obvious, when the jump in price is about 50% in a day or $100.&nbsp; Bitcoins has a lot of enemies, Governments, CIA, Banks, Securities, etc...&nbsp; Its easier to do this, then to pass bills or hack it.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />All this did was teach us a lesson on the movement of Bitcoins for the future.

				In the other posting of this suggestion in the discussion section, I say it was more likely to be manipulation for profit. However after more thought I think its even more likely just to be that a lot of people holding bit coins from the sub Â£10 days have been thinking it must be time to sell soon. One larger holder selling causes a slightly larger drop than usual and the panic begins.....it feeds off itself, everyone tries to sell at once jamming up the exchanges, and the price drops further.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It hppend with fiat currencies too due to speculative raids, but state economies tend to be much bigger and much less based on speculation, and as said elsewhere governments can print money. This can sometimes be pouring petrol on the fire.

				The only evidence that is needed is the actual occurrence of the crash. If you know the very nature of how bitcoin works and how far the price dropped, then you can come to a conclusion about what happened. Of course we do not know WHO did it exactly, we just know it was somebody capable of buying and dumping millions worth.<br /><br />You would think it&#039;s market manipulation for profit, but if this was the case they would have sold for high amounts and made profit that way. They would not have dumped at stupidly low prices of $50-100 when the current price was $230+. <br /><br />I had been studying the market depth of the MtGox market a few hours before the crash, and there were millions of dollars worth of Ask offers at the price of $250+. If someone dumped at $50 per coin everyone would quickly take notice, and adjust their ask offers. Many people have auto-api that automatically adjust their prices based on the buy/sell listings. So what happens is when someone dumps millions worth of BTC at $50-100, all those buyers adjust their prices. Many sellers quickly notice this and panic and then put their bidding listings at low amounts to try to get rid of them before they lose any money. This is how a crash occurs. When someone dumps a ton of BTC in at a very low price, they&#039;re losing money but also causing a giant tidal wave of destruction through the bitcoin market, causing all listings to adjust in prices accordingly. <br /><br />It IS economic terrorism, who ever caused it. They lost a lot of money but at the same time fucked up the market. Now you have fucking news media outlets saying bitcoin is a failure and saying it will never work. Even people like Alex Jones and Infowars are saying this - which is unbelievable. Not everyone is smart enough to comprehend a crash like this so they jump to conclusion. The fact is very rich and powerful people are capable of many things at certain costs to themselves.

				If you paid $10 for your coins, then dumping them for $100 to cause a crash purely to make a profit still makes sense in terms of a speculative attack. However I agree it does suggest some kind of market manipulation

I understand you are just making a point, but its flawed. Keep in mind the story of 19 hijackers is a conspiracy there is no proof they were even on the plane. <br /><br />I give credence to a banker crash, if you follow non mainstream news such as Rense Radio. the chatter for months was an attack by the bankers who are shitting in their pants that this could work. Bitcoin and igital currency all together face a challenge to teh system.<br /><br />if you dont believe me follow this carefully.<br /><br />Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran,&nbsp; Libya, Syria,&nbsp; Cuba, North korea, whats do they have in common? You would say hey thats the axis of evil right, but in reality these countries in 2000 had no central bank owned by the cartel. the day after Libya was overthrown they opened a central bank, same in afghanistan and iraq. north korea and iran next. to say hey cant manipulate markets is naive, they control almost all exchanges and markets to a degree are rigged. If you can print money out of thin air take a tree form the forest and in 24 hours turn it into 100 million usd euro pund chf, whatever cash they can manipulate any market. The central banks could buy all the bitcoins today and just hold them and they could print the money for free to buy them all. they do nto have to report anything to anyone the US fed does not have to tell US Congress anything.<br /><br />We as a society have become naive because we have been brainwashed by our news and leaders. As for Alex Jones, he is a shill he never touches the third rail read about what Bill Cooper said about Jones. <br /><br />anyways hope the coin goes back up so some folks can get their money back and there is some stability. Demand is going to come back and there will be bullish highs again.<br /><br />there are only 11 million coins if people just held them it doesnt take that many people to buy them all.<br /><br />Gotmilk<br /><br /><br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/98079f2164<br /><br />CRASH RECOVERY PROGRAM FREE ONE BLISTER OF 10 TABS YOUR CHOICE.

You would say hey thats the axis of evil right, but in reality these countries in 2000 had no central bank owned by the cartel. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Every one of those nations has had a central bank for decades. Even North Korea, albeit that&#039;s a truly weird situation, it&#039;s a confused mess like the rest of their economy. Unless you believe the Rothschild banking family owns all the other central banks but not those ones, which is where I think this conversation is going, then you&#039;re plain wrong. And if you do believe in such a conspiracy then you need to show evidence for it. e.g. internal documents from those central banks that mention ownership by the Rothschild family or something similar.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like central banking any more than you do, but there is no need for more elaborate explanations than politicians using central bank economic power to achieve short term political goals. Central banking is a bad idea, but it gets quite a bit worse when politicians interfere (the real reason why central banks are intended to be private institutions, it is no conspiracy, it&#039;s an attempt to prevent them!).<br /><br />Our politicians aren&#039;t any better than the Soviets at &quot;economic management&quot;. If the use of various economic tools actually allowed you to micromanage the economy successfully then it would logically follow that Communism would be a successful economic system. It isn&#039;t and they don&#039;t. Markets should determine all interest rates, or the result is disastrous. News at 11.<br /><br />Finally, RE: the OP. <br /><br />Markets, including the Bitcoin market, have always had a boom and bust cycle. Market crashes are an integral part of Capitalism and always will be. The function of recessions is to destroy the weak. Many times people find this profoundly immoral, since apparently strong business go out of business. In reality the structure of the system is flawed in some way, it might have nothing to do with the surface symptom, and the destruction of capital is necessary to remove the underlying impediment. Example: lots of good building corporations no doubt went bust during the recession in 2007 to date. That they were good building companies is irrelevant to their excisement from the economy. Their function was to assist the malinvestment caused by overly cheap credit thanks to artificially low interest rates. It seemed like a good thing but it was more like a bullet producing sepsis when buried under seemingly healthy skin. So, although they built good houses, those houses should never have existed in the first place, hence they went bust.<br /><br />Without central banks, we will still have bubbles, recessions, market crashes, whatever name you wish to call them. But they will be less systemic across all sectors and the economy in the broken sector will recover faster without central banks. If people wish to alleviate the pain caused by Capitalism, there are ways of doing so but it cannot be achieved by the State.<br /><br />Organization can be irrational, I think that is the hardest thing for anyone to accept when all our instincts say otherwise. Often it is best to just let things play themselves out. I wouldn&#039;t worry about the Bitcoin economy being manipulated too much, the true value of the currency shall ultimately establish itself one way or the other, $0 or $1000. Even if there are people attempting mass manipulations of the Bitcoin market, they can only change prices for a while, they can&#039;t change the value of the economy in the long term.<br /><br />Indeed the price of bitcoin has risen considerably today back up to 120 USD+ from 60 USD yesterday I think, so clearly any plot to instigate an attack on the bitcoin economy didn&#039;t really work very well. I think the market is just volatile because it contains an usually large number of speculators.

				&quot;Economic hitmen&quot; who work for the cia&nbsp; for their currency wars do exist, but anytime the government devalues a system covertly, they always make money off it, like during the ruble crisis.&nbsp; i have my doubts that the government would unload btc&#039;s in mass, especially if they didn&#039;t make any money.<br /><br />i CAN see the government, but more precisely a wallstreet financial institutions -unloading the market, then buying the coins back once they get super low.&nbsp; Sale a million worth in bitcoins, devalue it, then buy them back at a cheaper price....&nbsp; Well damn, you might make a few hundred thousand dollars or more in a very short time period.&nbsp;

Even in some LEO circles, there is a whole bunch of fraud techniques that suddenly stop working if you&#039;re using cryptocurrency e.g. chargeback fraud. The other government departments are either mostly neutral or think the concept is fucking cool as hell. That it pisses off the FBI/DEA is just an extra bonus. I think it would be a mistake to imagine that cryptocurrency doesn&#039;t have friends, I would even go so far as to say that Darknet markets such as Silk Road have friends in high places, probably not going to go so far as to help us out or anything, but they certainly see the advantage of taking market share away from the violent morons that have reduced so much of America to rubble.<br /><br />I mean it&#039;s not as if the government is entirely composed of one giant homogenous monolithic blob of assholes.

				Sounds like a plausible theory until you look at the facts.<br /><br />I know people, not Silk Road people, that got into bitcoin as the price was having it&#039;s parabolic rise. They are just ordinary people looking for a big score. These same people panicked the day of the crash, desperate to find the exits. Given that, I can see how this happened completely naturally.

				Wow, this is some kind of schizophrenic thread. Black helicopters hovering in and around a discussion of bitcoin&#039;s relationship to the CIA.<br /><br />astor has it exactly right regarding the impossibility of the government doing something like 9/11 with no leakage. Just like the Apollo moon landing conspiracists, the 9/11 truthers construct this elaborate house of cards/artificial reality based on selectively chosen ambiguities. In any huge event, there will always be lots of things that seem confusing and inconsistent.&nbsp; Hell - go back over your last week and try to explain in detail the causes and effects every event that happened to you with no loose ends or confusing inconsistencies.<br /><br />Always look for the simplest and most straightforward explanation for events, and you will rarely be led astray.&nbsp; Yes, the big banks can and do manipulate things all the time, but there&#039;s no need (or evidence that has been presented here) to argue that this bubble/crash was caused by anything more complicated than any other bubble. Some previously boring asset suddenly, and for reasons that aren&#039;t always clear but not necessarily nefarious, starts rising in value. A few people see this and jump on the wagon - people they know see that and hop on, too. the exponential rise in value of the asset mirrors exactly the exponential increase in number of people involved as each person turns on two others, who each turn on two others... Eventually things reach a level where a critical mass of the participants get nervous, and once the sell-off starts, everyone panics and - boom - we&#039;re done. Bitcoin over the last month could not look more like the exact thing that happened with Iomega Corp. (as the best example of many) during the tech boom of the late 1990&#039;s. Admittedly at a slightly slower velocity, the same sort of &quot;I&#039;m going get rich!&quot; mentality took hold and had the exact same end result. No need t invoke some sort of One World Conspiracy.<br /><br />That being said, I don&#039;t actually hold any action as being out bounds for the warped, devious, greedy assholes currently running things, I just don&#039;t think they&#039;re as smart as they think they are, and some things are beyond their capability.

				Ok&nbsp; conspiracy people this is what I got out of everything I read this person bitcoinbillionaire had bit coins from four years ago that was bought at $5 but they had like 500 of them and they gave them away for free so people started spending them as if they was&nbsp; worth $260 and the miners then started hashing them finding them easily with very little chain to them I mean the reason for bit coins to increase in price is so that percentage you get as a miner can increase because it gets harder and takes longer every time you make another transaction the chain block gets bigger&nbsp; we pay for people to verify transactions but after every transaction if it takes twice as long&nbsp; to verify it than the transaction before it then we need to pay twice as much but the minners are only getting a percentage so if the price of the bitcoin always stays the same the percentage will always stay the same do you follow me so the miners mined these bitcoins worth $5 and sent the blockchains back to the central hub to get paid and it averaged their worth in with all the other bitcoins and how hard it is to get the blockchain in with all the other bitcoins blockchain and sent it to the market

				Good theory, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;re right.<br /><br />What I believe happened was what was coined (haha) Operation Foolcoin. I think it&#039;s still on reddit if you want to go see for yourself. Anyway, in OP. Foolcoin a group of &quot;hackers&quot; dumped their BTCs in the 250s and 260s range. After this dump they launched a MASSIVE botnet attack against MTGox, BTC-E, Bitfloor, BitStamp, and even the BTC forums Bitcointalk.

				There are no facts in an ANONYMOUS MARKETPLACE. BTC is a cryptocurrency... which means no one knows who is manipulating the market. It&#039;s also a coinage that serves black marketsss...<br /><br />So, yeah, bankers are bad. So are gangsters. Is any party more deserving of blame? No, because we don&#039;t know who is toying with a Free Market--FREE, as in &quot;I&#039;ll do what I want&quot;.

If you know the very nature of how bitcoin works and how far the price dropped, then you can come to a conclusion about what happened. Of course we do not know WHO did it exactly, we just know it was somebody capable of buying and dumping millions worth.<br /><br />You would think it&#039;s market manipulation for profit, but if this was the case they would have sold for high amounts and made profit that way. They would not have dumped at stupidly low prices of $50-100 when the current price was $230+. <br /><br />I had been studying the market depth of the MtGox market a few hours before the crash, and there were millions of dollars worth of Ask offers at the price of $250+. If someone dumped at $50 per coin everyone would quickly take notice, and adjust their ask offers. Many people have auto-api that automatically adjust their prices based on the buy/sell listings. So what happens is when someone dumps millions worth of BTC at $50-100, all those buyers adjust their prices. Many sellers quickly notice this and panic and then put their bidding listings at low amounts to try to get rid of them before they lose any money. This is how a crash occurs. When someone dumps a ton of BTC in at a very low price, they&#039;re losing money but also causing a giant tidal wave of destruction through the bitcoin market, causing all listings to adjust in prices accordingly. <br /><br />It IS economic terrorism, who ever caused it. They lost a lot of money but at the same time fucked up the market. Now you have fucking news media outlets saying bitcoin is a failure and saying it will never work. Even people like Alex Jones and Infowars are saying this - which is unbelievable. Not everyone is smart enough to comprehend a crash like this so they jump to conclusion.
