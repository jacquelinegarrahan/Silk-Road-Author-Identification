				Phenazepam - Powerful benzo with none of the fun effects of a benzo.&nbsp; Has an extremely long half life and has led many into a 5+ day long blackout resulting in waking up in a prison cell, road, some random house or just not at all (aka death)<br /><br />Scopolamine - Not very recreational and has a boatload of misuses that it can be used for.&nbsp; It&#039;s not a hallucinogenic drug, it&#039;s a delieriant, it will have you TRULY believing you&#039;re smoking that cigarette that actually isn&#039;t in your hands and leaves you with fleeting memories if any of what happened.&nbsp; Also extremely dangerous in terms of dosing pure scopolamine, it&#039;s very easy to overdose, and the result&#039;s aren&#039;t pretty (there&#039;s a little more control if it&#039;s the Datura seeds themselves, not a purified extract, but my first sentence stands for itself).<br /><br />Pentobarbital (large quanties) - People seem to only be seeking this out as a means to commit suicide, which i&#039;d rather not see / hear of.&nbsp; Smaller quantities fine, but 9+ grams they are trying to off themselves.&nbsp; It&#039;s your choice if you choose that path, I just don&#039;t think SR should be the conduit through which you can obtain the means to do so (commit suicide).<br /><br />One person has been trying to seek out Hydrogen Cyanide, Tetradotoxin, Ricin and pure Nicotine probably other&#039;s too.&nbsp; Those I don&#039;t consider drugs at all, but poison with no other use then to cause harm/death.<br /><br />I&#039;m not a fan at all of MDPV either, but it is recreational and it CAN (but rarely is) be used ... responsibly.&nbsp; The powerful urge to redose though and then end up doing crazy things does not make for a drug i&#039;d like to see around.

				I don&#039;t believe in banning any drug, no matter how dangerous or unpleasant the effects may be. <br />It is up to the user to decide whether or not what they are doing is best for them. If they fuck up their lives as a result of drug use, they were a victim of their own irresponsibility, not the drug. The way I see it, drugs for them were a quicker means to the same end. Even if drugs didn&#039;t exist, they would have found some other way to hurt themselves and those around them.<br />A big reason why drugs are illegal today are because people destroy their lives through drug use, then fail to take responsibility for their own actions. They point fingers and say things like &quot;drugs ruined my life.&quot; Well actually, drugs didn&#039;t ruin your life; you ruined your life. Unfortunately, black tar heroin doesn&#039;t have the right to an attorney, let alone defend itself. It is simply a substance, and it&#039;s not going to get into your system unless you make the decision to put it there.<br />Now, deaths and health complications caused by cutting agents or dishonest dealers are completely different, but those are inevitable results of the criminalization of drug use.<br />Just my two bitcoins<br /><br />-schmuck

				I&#039;m not so sure the chance of a drug heing used for suicide should really play a part in it being banned or not because if that was the case we&#039;d lose heroin, all benzos, hell most pills in general.&nbsp; There are tons of drugs available on SR that could easily be used to facilitate suicide.&nbsp; I just pray anyone planning to do so would reach out for help first :(

				Prohibition solves nothing , it&nbsp; is proven to increase use of said prohibited substance.<br /><br />Drugs should be legalized and the money saved from less gang related violence/healthcare/LE funds etc , could be funneled into education and support networks for those with problems.<br /><br />The world would be a funner , safer , less violent and healthier. <br /><br />This wasn&#039;t written very eloquently but you get my drift.

				I would certainly see plenty of drugs regulated; but I would assume we are all here because we want our drug(s) to be available and legal so I wouldn&#039;t ban anything because I think everyone should have freedom of choice.

				Alcohol, heroine, meth, maybe commercial cigs and a few nasty rc&#039;s that mess with your blood pressure and give skin rashes - but banning is in actuality impossible because people will continue to manufacture these drugs, whether their governments ban them or not.

				I think it&#039;s easy to say &quot;all drugs should be legal upon completion of a course on the addiction potential and safety&quot; until you&#039;re dealing with something 1500x stronger than morphine, i.e. Etonitazene. For mankind&#039;s sake, I hope RC opiates like that never set foot outside of the lab.<br /><br />Has anyone actually used Etonitazene, you might be wondering. Why yes, there actually is such a reported case!: <br /><br />&nbsp;Thomas Highsmith worked at a prestigious laboratory in Salt Lake City designing low-friction laminates for high-performance skis. In 2003, he started spending long nights in his lab secretly manufacturing a personal supply of etonitazene. Shortly after completing the synthesis, he became hopelessly addicted. He would show up for work clutching a 12-ounce spray bottle of etonitazene and fiendishly snort it throughout the day. Over the course of a couple of months, his tolerance escalated to the point where he was taking 300 times his starting dose. A coworker became suspicious of Highsmith’s odd behavior and reported him to the police. His etonitazene supply was seized, and he was prescribed methadone to combat the withdrawal. At that point, his addiction equated to 500 bags of heroin a day, and the methadone umbrella did nothing to deflect the 10,000-pound etonitazene anvil hurtling toward his head. Highsmith never received a criminal sentence because he was found dead in his home before his first court date. The withdrawals were so severe that he had killed himself to escape the pain. <br /><br />http://www.vice.com/read/hamiltons-pharmacopeia-804-v16n4 <br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etonitazene <br />http://www.deseretnews.com/article/987708/Chemist-charged-in-drug-case.html?pg=all <br /><br />... fuck everything about that.<br />

				I can&#039;t vouch for the synthetics your smoking, but the ones I have smoked do not have that effect. I know there are many cannabinoids in cannabis, but they are all close analogues of one another. These synthetics have wildly different structures and can affect the receptors in ways that cannabinoids in cannabis can&#039;t (most are full agonists at at least one of the CB1 and CB2 receptors for a start). I&#039;ve smoked many different types of weed but the effects some synthetics have are just on a different part of the spectrum altogether.<br /><br />But as you can see, we are both talking about synthetic weed but clearly talking about 2 different blends of compounds going on our conflicting descriptions. That&#039;s the problem with lumping all synthetic cannabinoids into one big group. Each chemical is unique, and some are clearly better/worse than others. I&#039;m in Australia where quite a large number of synthetic cannabinoids have been banned, and we have analog laws ruling out the use of simple fluorinated alternatives, so we are only seeing the newer synthetics, none of the JWH series for sure.

I know there are many cannabinoids in cannabis, but they are all close analogues of one another.

I&#039;ve smoked many different types of weed but the effects some synthetics have are just on a different part of the spectrum altogether.<br /><br />But as you can see, we are both talking about synthetic weed but clearly talking about 2 different blends of compounds going on our conflicting descriptions. That&#039;s the problem with lumping all synthetic cannabinoids into one big group. Each chemical is unique, and some are clearly better/worse than others. I&#039;m in Australia where quite a large number of synthetic cannabinoids have been banned, and we have analog laws ruling out the use of simple fluorinated alternatives, so we are only seeing the newer synthetics, none of the JWH series for sure.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />You are right, everyone should do what feels good for him, but each one should ask himself if it truly makes him feel good...

				This is very tricky to answer that, and there are many aspects to the problem.<br /><br />As others said, SilkRoad was created exactly for that reason : bypass prohibition of drugs, because we all know many drugs are useful when used correctly.<br /><br />However, I tend to agree with you :<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=59544.msg550003#msg550003">Quote from: JoeyGPesci007 on October 28, 2012, 02:56 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">I think all drugs should be legal upon completion of a course on the addiction potential and safety. If you can read about phenazepam for more than an hour and not realize that&#039;s not a good thing to be involved with then by all means, go for it.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve seen so many people trying a drug when they knew hardly nothing about it, or just what some not so trustworthy friend (or pusher) told them.&nbsp; Many drug users are stupids, they don&#039;t think more than one second before trying a drug.&nbsp; Not everybody wants to screw its life when he tries a drug for the first time.&nbsp; Many just want some fun without thinking first about consequences, possible addiction, or physical/psychological damage.&nbsp; <br /><br />I agree with the fact that forbidding drugs is not the way to go, but sometimes we must have some rules, or at least systems, to prevent people to hurt themselves involuntary.&nbsp; <br /><br />A good analogy here would be : <br />Driving is dangerous.&nbsp; Therefore, many many people drives every day.&nbsp; But do you give a car to a guy who don&#039;t know how to drive ?&nbsp; Do you think it&#039;s OK to prevent him to drive before he took lessons / driving exam ?&nbsp; Most of you would answer no. (Update : I meant yes)<br />IMO it&#039;s the same thing about drugs.&nbsp; I have a friend who tried amphetamine for the first time a few months back.&nbsp; At the moment he only knew it was a speed drug and he thought it would be a good idea to test it at his job to see if it would enhance his productivity...&nbsp; I just don&#039;t wanna think about what would&#039;ve happened if he tried methamphetamine (crystal meth) or another nasty drug instead..&nbsp; I like to think that if he read about it before, maybe he would&#039;ve changed his mind...&nbsp; <br /><br />So a good solution IMO would be to only sell a drug to someone who successfully passed a relatively small (but thorough) test about the safety and possible addiction of the drug he wants to buy/try.&nbsp; Of course it&#039;s only the beginning of a solution, but I really think it would help people consume drugs more responsibly without forbidding them (it&#039;s a bad idea to forbid drugs, all studies showed it, but LE and politicians are very itchy about trusting scientists, not mentioning they&#039;re often linked/controlled by mafia, criminal organizations, etc.). <br /><br />Sorry I&#039;m sure my english is bad but I did the best I could.

				I dunno, for the goal of personal liberty and freedom, I am against the banning or scheduling of substances. But I must admit, that if things like Piperazines and PMMA or other things that chemists put in pills sold as E (especially in the U.S.) were banned or more severely scheduled than MDMA, you wouldn&#039;t be able to count all the f*cks that I would not give.<br /><br />&nbsp;I originally came to SR because of all the times I had been sold pipes. Of course, you can buy a testing kit (which I did), but I just hate the fact that these awful pills that can harm or kill people are being unscrupulously sold as MDMA for profit and ease of access.

				we drink it all the time, but I&#039;d say alcohol just for a joke - the vast VAST majority of death and coma in the ER are secondary to alcohol and the many conditions that a chronic alcoholic suffer.

I know prohibition didn&#039;t work so I wouldn&#039;t seriously suggest this, but I&#039;m just saying - you don&#039;t see people dying in the ER from weed overdoses (maybe a panic attack or two) but nothing compares to the etoh when it comes to numbers.

				*disclaimer* didn&#039;t read every page but glanced over the first&nbsp; */disclaimer*<br /><br />Some discuss having every drug legal. Personally, that is my opinion. From personal experience and the experiences of my comrades, illegality means nothing. If somebody wants a drug that can harm them, they&#039;ll get it. The difference then, is where they get their drugs. If they get them from the streets they are likely to get cuts and unreliable quality and all-around &quot;dirty&quot; shit. Not to mention, if we&#039;re talking about meth, heroin, or anything else someone might IV/IM, they&#039;re going to reuse or improperly use needles and hurt themselves in that way. <br /><br />As much as I dislike a lot of what the government has its hands in, legalization of all drugs would lead to safe/healthy(as healthy as some drugs are) regulations that providers must meet. Additionally, I like the idea of mandatory education classes (and not bullshit &quot;stay-clean&quot; classes) that are geared towards whatever drug you want in on. You want to start doing heroin? Well first you got to take the general opiates class and provide proof you&#039;ve been using lesser opiates for x length of time before upgrading (we can just piss test these people every time they come to class) and then you will be taught the dangers/advantages of each RoA as well as how to properly prepare your drug for IV/smoke/snorting, etc. <br /><br />I feel a lot of questionable/less-known drugs (I&#039;m looking at you, RCs) will fall by the wayside if everyone can access pharm-grade drugs to utilize at affordable prices (Why try that opiate RC that&#039;s been around for years when you can rely on using one that&#039;s been tested solidly for decades?)<br /><br />Pipe dream? Yes. However, in short, I don&#039;t want to see any drug banned because banning anything, from weapons to drugs, is not an effective mode of prevention. If there are drugs that people shouldn&#039;t use, the best deterrent will be honest education discussing WHY those drugs should be avoided. <br /><br />Cheers, and I hope I covered at least a little more than what&#039;s already been said in this thread, <br /><br /><br />Snoopish

				every drug should be banned that I&#039;m not currently doing because they&#039;re bad. when I move on on some different drug it should be legalized because it&#039;s okay and the drugs I stobbed doing should be banned because they&#039;re bad.

				Most drugs should be legal, however people should be required to take precaution, and information classes on their drug of choice. Plus a mental health checkout for the harder drugs.&nbsp; :-\ Wouldn&#039;t want people to take too much of something for the wrong reason...Although scopolamine scares me...

				I don&#039;t think any drugs should be band all should be legal, but at the same time I think we would be better off without without heroin and alcohol but that&#039;s only because I have had family who have been addicted to both, but at the same time their are millions who can enjoy them and be responsible with their drug use&nbsp; &nbsp;???

				I guess it&#039;s hard to answer this question pragmatically without going in circles. E.g. - ban x substance because of z reason -&gt; good for this and that reason -&gt; prohibition doesn&#039;t work. I still think it&#039;s important to talk about though. So here&#039;s what I think:<br /><br />I can respect and understand the view that no, or very few drugs and substances should be banned on the basis of individual liberties. The idea that you can take what you want, fuck yourself up, and it&#039;s your fault, but if you use it to fuck with yourself then you should be dealt with accordingly.<br /><br />However I&#039;m of the view that very few people&#039;s bodies are theirs to fuck up. That sounds weird, but let me explain. The legalization of some heavy duty shit, like ice, bromo-dragonfly or heroin&nbsp; means that I could have access to it. From this point of view I could try and take these drugs and thus I could become addicted and fuck my life up (I also might not get to this extreme, but, let&#039;s just say that I do because these are highly addictive substances I think, although correct me if I&#039;m wrong, and the propensity for me and others to get addicted is real). Okay so I do that, but I&#039;m important to how family functions from all things including their housing situation, welfare, happiness etc., my job,&nbsp; my friends and I dare say, my community and society. As such my body isn&#039;t really &#039;mine&#039; to fuck up, and I believe that very few people&#039;s bodies are too. I&#039;ve spent time in communities where substance abuse is a real problem - and it&#039;s always the stuff that is legal and easy to obtain. People smoke weed every now and then , and that&#039;s hardly a problem. <br /><br />I don&#039;t really know what I think should be banned in any exhaustive sense. All I can say is that I know what I feel shouldn&#039;t be -&nbsp; Cannabis, mushrooms, low dose LSD, salvia divinorum, peyote, and other entheogens with positive spiritual benefits. <br />

				No drugs should be illegal. In my opinion the more dangerous a drug is the more reasons to legalize and regulate it. Not saying all drugs should be easy to get a hold of, but it should be possible to get it legal somehow

				I hope no one disagrees with me, but I&#039;ve tried meth once with a friend, and just about had a nervous breakdown. They say &quot;Meth, not even once&quot;, but once was enough to keep me away from it for a life time.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure there are other drugs that have a more pleasant high associated with it. Also, some of those before/after pics of meth addicts scare the shit out of me.<br /><br />I&#039;m sure, with moderation, meth could be fun, maybe; but to me, I couldn&#039;t care less if meth was banned.

In short, prohibition never leads to desired results. Even if the government wanted to regulate certain substances, controlling them is a much more effective method than outright banning them.

				An excellent quote on this subject came from a convict in a maximum security prison which goes something like this:<br /><br />&quot;In prison you could get ANY drug you wanted. If you didn&#039;t go in with an addiction, you went out with one. Now, if you can&#039;t control the flow of illegal drugs in a maximum security prison where no one has a bit of privacy, how can you hope to control them in a free society?&quot;

				i&#039;d like to see tobacco very gradually phased out. much like how they keep raising the pension age so that every year. this is coming from someone who smoked for 8 years, quit for almost a year, started again then stopped then started again etc etc. i don&#039;t like paying tax for drugs it feels unnatural. also tobacco as a drug doesn&#039;t really do much except put cash in the pockets of govt and most likely underpaid virginian farmers. the (shocking to some)problem is the government don&#039;t really want people to stop smoking.<br /><br />When it comes to cigarette sales, the government is the main player, not the tobacco industry. Around 85% of&nbsp; the cost of a packet of cigarettes is tax and goes to the Treasury.&nbsp; In essence, you are purchasing your favourite pack of cigarettes directly from the government. The tobacco industry’s cut is only around 10% to 15%.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Total income from tobacco sales is approx. £14bn<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The Treasury receives approx. £12bn through revenue<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The tobacco industry receives approx £2bn through sales<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Cost of treating smokers on NHS is estimated to be £5bn per year.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Pensions and support savings is estimated at £10bn per year (smokers dying early)<br /><br />The average life expectancy for a non-smoker is 77.7 years for a man and 81.9 years for women. For smokers, life expectancy is reduced to 64.5 year for a man and 67.5 years for a woman.<br /><br />Tobacco smokers who work their whole lives paying tax on their salaries and on cigarettes contribute to the Treasury funds, but will not live long enough to claim state pension for very long, if at all. That’s a win-win situation for the government.

				Who ever said weed, you need to get better connects or stop smoking to much of the wrong strain for the wrong environments. <br /><br />I was going to say alcohol thinking I would be the only one to think this but looks like there are a few that beat me to it, the stuff is evil, cant actually believe its legal when you think about it logically.<br /><br />Imagine if alcohol were to be discovered right now in this day and age but instead of drinking it lets say you had to smoke it but with exactly the same effects, rage, anger, false sense of confidence, drowsy, fighting, vomiting, stomach pains, etc it would be banned and made into a class A(schedule 1) no in fact it would be above class A the government would have to give its own separate category. <br /><br />If cannabis were to be discovered right now it would be classed as a wonder drug sent from above, such a fucked up cruel world were living inn right now, but don&#039;t worry change is happening faster than I could of ever imagined.<br /><br />If you love your weed make sure you do her justice and become a little bit of an activist, don&#039;t let the uneducated and brainwashed slate her any more, don&#039;t let them get to you either, just calmly and confidently explain to people who slander weed the truth and the facts, knowledge is your weapon you must arm yourself to the hills, its only a matter of time before cannabis is legal world wide, trust me on this one.<br /><br />The Dutch have the right idea classing alcohol as a hard drug and not having it as a separate matter.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong I used to drink with the best of them but out of all the drugs I have done this is by far the worst.<br /><br />Give me a bag of Premium weed and block of lovely hash and I&#039;m happy, its all I need these days :)<br /><br /><br />

				I have never tried methamphetamine but I have tried heroin and crack cocaine a couple of times. Heroin takes a while to get addicted to (I didn&#039;t get that far) but with crack the addiction instant (at least it was for me). I could never refuse a crack pipe, but I don&#039;t see my crack-addicted mates anymore. Problem solved.<br /><br />Don&#039;t try crack. Seriously.<br /><br />While I wouldn&#039;t wish for any drug to be banned, the world would probably be a better place if some of them weren&#039;t invented in the first place.

				Read the WHOLE thread. These responses are interesting. I&#039;m with the small government crowd. Except I&#039;d take it a step further:<br /><br />NO regulation of any kind for any drug or pharmaceutical or chemical. Initially, this would probably result in a few deaths of idiots or (sadder) the unattended children of idiots. <br /><br />But think of it this way: what if, for the last 100 years, instead of being fed disinformation (about recreational drugs) or propaganda and paid advertizements (about pharmecuticals and coffee and cigs and booze, etc) the people of the world would have had 100 years to experiment on their own bodies as they saw fit. Scientists would have had 100 years to do real research about the effects of all of these psycoactive chemicals. <br /><br />I would be willing to bet that if that had been the case for the last 100 years, the few deaths along the way from dumb-asses (or even just unfortunate accidents) would have been far outweighed by the massive advances in medicine, etc. Because, lets face it, the deaths from dumb-asses and unfortunate accidents happen anyway. Some could argue more, some could argue less. <br /><br />Of course there&#039;s no way to know for sure, but imagine if 420 was legal for the last 100 years. I don&#039;t know how you &quot;self medicate&quot; with MJ, but I personally use it as a sleep aide, and appetite controller, an anti anxiety medication, a pain killer, and an alternative to alcohol. Now maybe my response to cannabis is only similar to 1% of the population. even if that&#039;s the case, that would be 1% of the entire world who has no need of oxi, benzos, ambien, booze, etc. That in itself would save some lives, I think. But get this: I actually know a LOT of people who would NEVER smoke weed as long as it&#039;s illegal but they would take a whole handful of pain killers or benzos AS LONG AS THE DOC ENDORSES IT. I know a few who have developed severe opiate addictions because of this. <br /><br />Also, I&#039;ve heard about things like meth being used for weight loss, ketamine being used as an anti depressant, opium being used as an anti Hershey squirts, etc, etc, etc. Maybe some of these applications are good, maybe not, but I feel like research into these possibilities is severely limited because so much of the population still feels the need to lower their voices to a whisper whenever anyone is discussing any compound that could possibly be used recreationaly. <br /><br />I personally feel that almost all governments world wide (aside from the ones that barely exist - recovering from civil war or supper corrupt or whatever) have gotten WAY too big for their own good. The result is a generation of people who are dependent on their government. People were never meant to be dependent on their government. Unfortunately many of us DO need &quot;big brother&quot; telling us how to raise our kids and what to eat and what to do with our lives - but we shouldn&#039;t. it&#039;s time people started taking responsibility for themselves and their actions and their kids. I personally believe that until either (A) the government becomes much smaller and starts forcing people to reap the benefits and the consequences of their actions OR (B) a massive wave of people choose to do just that on their own, we are going to continue to feel more and more trapped by our society. I&#039;ve only been adult enough to think about this stuff for about 15 years and I&#039;ve felt a HUGE decrease in the amount of personal freedom I&#039;ve felt. And the &quot;squeeze&quot; comes from a combination of societies &quot;values&quot; and and increase in government.<br /><br />anyway. my 2 cents
