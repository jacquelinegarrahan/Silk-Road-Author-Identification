				How many of you have been living with social anxiety and panic attacks? What drugs do you use to make you &quot;normal,&quot; or make your anxiety go away? For me, I&#039;m great with small groups, or large groups of friends. But a room full of strangers is almost unbearable, I&#039;ll freak out in my head, and just remove myself from the situation.

				I&#039;ve actually never even been to a psychiatrist. Haven&#039;t experimented with any benzos yet either. I might try xanax soon, but other than that I don&#039;t plan on doing much. What do you personally do about your issues? Weed? <br /><br />And what do you mean &quot;improve the situation.&quot;

In cognitive therapy you&#039;ll examine the physiological reactions you have to certain situations, what thoughts are going through your mind while your body is reacting in these ways, and come up with alternative things to think when you&#039;re in the situations that bring up your issues. Then you put yourself into the kind of situations that bring up your issues and practice these new ways of thinking. With enough effort, the new should replace the old, and you should get a handle on things. Works pretty well, though it can be a slog. :)

				In all honesty, you have to fight through it, like a battle.<br /><br />One route is taking drugs like Xanex, the benzos. And this will work but only temporarily.<br /><br />I have to tell you that it is possible to overcome this anxiety, but it is not easy. You have to constantly put yourself in situations where you are around new people.<br /><br />For me, it was difficult at first to even walk into a McDonalds and place an order. Then I worked through that, and it was difficult to sit in a restaurant, but I had to work through it to find comfort. Now I can go into very good restaurants and feel at home.<br /><br />To be totally honest with you, there is no easy way. You have to do the work. You have to push yourself out of the comfort zone.<br /><br />It sucks, but you&#039;re not the only one, and I hope you will find your way.

				The ILF wouldn&#039;t wish a panic attack on our worst enemies.<br /><br />Wanted to mention that one has to be careful with benzos, since withdrawal from them can actually in and of itself cause or worsen panic attacks.<br /><br />Being in a living situation in which one generally doesn&#039;t feel safe or valued might add to or create the problem, also.&nbsp; Having a true home is an invaluable thing.<br /><br />Ecstasy can help social anxiety, even in low doses.<br /><br />+1 on the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as well.&nbsp; Even just getting a book on it can help, if one doesn&#039;t want to/can&#039;t afford a therapist.&nbsp; If one can, finding a good one can provide a life-changing relationship.<br /><br />And maybe some Ketamine bumps to get the mind shifting gears easier.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; If one&#039;s never done K, it can be weird at first, but the ability to explore the weirdness can be therapeutic as one develops more of a familiarity with it.<br /><br />To respond to the critique of self-medicating, the ILF would make the disclaimer that the drugs can be on a as-needed basis.<br /><br />Definitely a struggle, but let&#039;s keep our heads up!

				Dude I had them real bad for a while.&nbsp; And yes xanax works well but you don&#039;t want to have to take a pill all the time it sucks.&nbsp; I quit smoking weed for 7 months and quit eating xanax and started being a better dad and husband plus ate well worked well and exercised and haven&#039;t had one in almost a half a year.&nbsp; I think I was spending too much money on weed and cigs and felt bad inside knowing I could of been spending that money on my sons and wife and once I stopped it got better to my surprise.&nbsp; I had killer panic attacks to the point where I would feel like I&#039;m dreaming and tripping all fucked up heart beating and loosing my mind.&nbsp; Its scary because all you want to do is get out of yourself but you cant and feel trapped.&nbsp; Its like a bad trip.<br />

When you stop using xanax the anxiety and panic attacks are a lot worse. <br /><br />I hear valerian root is very good for treating anxiety. So is improving your diet and exercising. More calcium. Less shit. Less drugs. What ilf and joey said is pretty accurate also. Take there advice.

				+1 to Deer Park and Dipset, especially regarding the diet and exercise.&nbsp; One of the ILF used to think that exercising was a &quot;superficial&quot; thing that only people who were into &quot;working out&quot; did and that having a &quot;good diet&quot; was just for health &quot;nuts&quot;, but he was making a huge mistake in forgetting the very important, and very real, link between the mind and body.&nbsp; Amazing how much a difference even 30 mins a day of something simple like walking or bike riding can make in dealing with anxiety-related insomnia.&nbsp; Awesome how more fruits and vegetables and making sure to eat a solid meal can make one&#039;s outlook and energy considerably better.&nbsp; The &quot;fast-paced&quot; world might make these things seem unimportant, but taking a little more time to do them can make a major difference.<br /><br />Also, Dipset, glad to hear that you were able to make those life changes!&nbsp; Know what you mean about the panic: it&#039;s like you really think you *are*/*have* lost your fuckin&#039; mind and are not getting it back.

				As mentioned in this thread, a lifestyle change of exercise and a good diet does help a lot. How does your caffeine consumption look? Until you are able to control your anxiety you should eliminate all stimulants, even caffeine. Beyond that there are some natural supplements that you should really check out before you even consider going on prescription drug. The best recommendation I can give you is Kava Kava, it works very well for anxiety and from what you&#039;ve written, I think it would help you tremendously. L-theanine and possibly GABA are also good and could be taken in addition to Kava Kava, if you feel that alone is not enough.

				Supplements do seem to help!&nbsp; In addition to the those mentioned so far, maybe try 5-HTP?&nbsp; One of the theories of anxiety is that there&#039;s an excess of dopamine in the brain, and so if you insert a little more serotonin into the equation, it can calm the worrywart down.&nbsp; One member of the ILF absolutely swears by 5-HTP.&nbsp; You&#039;ll catch him popping that serotonin boost in restaurants, in parking lots, in the shower ...&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />

				I have anxiety issues.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; I use benzos.&nbsp; I have a prescription for klonopin but also use xanax and Valium.&nbsp; If you buy some benzos dont eat them unless you feel you need to and eat as little as possible.&nbsp; I don&#039;t usually even eat a whole .5mg klonopin, I eat half and might only eat a half in a day, might eat none, or might eat a whole pill.&nbsp; I don&#039;t want to develop some sort of 3 times a day pill eating party like some people end up doing so I only eat the pill when necessary.<br /><br />I stopped smoking weed as it was increasing my anxiety, though I think the weed garden in my spare bedroom was increasing it a lot more, lol.&nbsp; Not growing weed anymore so that has helped.&nbsp; Good luck, and remember if you use benzos eat them as little as possible.&nbsp; Definitely don&#039;t treat with becoming a fucking alcoholic.

				The ILF also hate the fact that the injustice system and the threat of its draconian punishments causes good people so much anxiety.&nbsp; Good people who are providing and engaging in healing, spiritual, fun experiences, and the government can&#039;t wait to take away their freedom, vilify them, and before it even gets to that point, try to drive them crazy with fear.&nbsp; It&#039;s really sad, even more so when one thinks how cruel it really is and how it doesn&#039;t have to be that way.<br /><br />But that&#039;s why we&#039;re all here.&nbsp; The underground is ancient; long live the underground!

				I have horrible anxiety especially social anxiety. I haven&#039;t went to get a prescription because I have social anxiety and the thought alone of going to the doctor and talking about my issue makes me stress. I need to buy some of Oliver&#039;s blotters and just be my own doctor, so I can get a real job and try to live a life people consider normal. Not for my sake or happiness but for my childss, so they have a fair chance in society by having a normal upbringing.

				Give Phenibut a try. It&#039;s cheap, legal and has been shown to have effects similar to low dose MDMA. You can source it on Amazon. Just be careful not to take it more than 3-4 times a week as it can cause withdrawl similar to that of benzos.

				I have pretty severe social anxiety and a tendency to be reclusive and not leave the house. It&#039;s difficult for me to go anywhere public. It&#039;s a very crippling disorder&nbsp; :(<br /><br />I have been on Zoloft for almost a year, but I still have a nice full-on panic attack every once in a while and a general feeling of anxiety in social situations. Sometimes it can really feel like no one understands. I feel for anyone else with this problem &lt;3

				I was prescribed propranolol for my social anxiety along with zofran because nausea was the biggest symptom for me. Propranolol helps with the physical symptoms like heart rate, dry mouth, sweating, and nausea. Its non-addictive and a very cheap generic. I was prescribed low dose of only 10mg so you don&#039;t need a lot when taking it for social anxiety. Plug it to get double the BA. <br /><br />Valium and the other benzos work for the mental aspect of the anxiety, but are expensive and addictive. Use sparingly.

				i had this,well still do just i dont think as severe <br /><br />the thing is i had taken mephedrone and it caused problems big problems the anxiety and panic attacks<br /><br />had to take a line to settle me down to flush everything because i knew myself i had to do it<br /><br />months after being off it i was still freaking out not leaving the house up all night standing watching out the window adament i was being watched<br />even normal things i used to do i lost all interest and even tv i watched i used to think why did i watch this <br />&nbsp;<br />i also went through this alone told no1, i became very uneasy with close friends who i lost.<br /><br />to add i didnt intentionly take the meph i was told it was a valium (didnt no much then) and if i took it its great with weed it wasnt and it was a gram cap i took, this so called friend was a nasty piece of work who then asked me to hold a lot for him and while &quot;high&quot; took it and i had it all <br /><br />i had read up on so many ways to see what i could do to help myself&nbsp; and the one thing that struck me was ego death<br /><br />sorry realised im rabbiting on il cut it down, built up trying drugs to be prepared to try acid, like speed coke e ket to see if it would help me get out,<br /><br />then eventually acid which took a long time to get to but it more gave me a &quot;glow&quot; for a few days thinking all was better then eventually dmt<br /><br />that helped a lot big time. still take valium on occasion just when it a wee bit too much.<br /><br />i havent said this to more than the fingers on my hand i think thats why i was starting to get carried away<br /><br />but thats what happened with me not saying its the best way or anything just my thoughts<br /><br />its a horrible feeling <br /><br />ggg

				Try CBT therapy,and read something about autogenic training by J.H.Shultz. There are also some cbt self help manuals available on torrent trackers like &quot;Dr. Thomas A. Richards - Overcoming Social Anxiety&quot;<br /><br />Avoid benzos,alcool and similar additive substances if possible.<br /><br />If you have a friend you trust you could try dextrometorphan (cheap and lab grade - it&#039;s a pharmaceutic product) or similar introspective chems and talk with him having the talking recorded so you can lissen to it later.<br />Check &quot;psychedelic therapy&quot; and &quot;Samuel Widmer&quot; on google.

				I used to have horrible anxiety when I was in college. I had to actually leave my uni before it got better. Even then it creeps back when I&#039;m in a stressful situation. I find that I have to be by myself as I really don&#039;t know how to handle it. It also pretty much went away after I got on a good birth control pill, I stopped getting so depressed and felt happier, but I doubt that&#039;s an option for you. <br /><br />When I smoke too much week I get anxiety and paranoid, but I think that&#039;s a pretty common thing. And I have to get really stoned to feel like this. Also, caffeine gives me massive anxiety. That type where you sigh and can&#039;t fill up your lungs and want to tear your hair out? Yea, I don&#039;t miss that.<br /><br />Be careful about the drugs though. They do make you feel better and everything becomes easier when you&#039;re on them or after a good binge, but that&#039;s only temporary - there&#039;s a hangover for a reason. Just identifying what you have is a big relief as you can start to overcome it. Good luck.

				EDIT: Bleh, I wrote this more geared toward depression, but depression and anxiety often go hand-in-hand. Hope it&#039;s useful anyway.<br /><br />Try EMDR therapy.<br /><br />It sounds crazy, but it really works wonders.&nbsp; It lets you reach down deep inside and truly confront the deepest darkest issues that are bringing you down.<br /><br />Also, have you considered psychedelics? (I say this hesitantly; I don&#039;t know how comfortable you are with psychedelics and an inexperienced tripper can get in way over his/her head)<br /><br />Mushrooms helped me tremendously with my depression. 25i has helped me a lot too; it took me from still somewhat depressed to the happy motivated person that I want to be and know I can be.<br /><br />Hope this helps and best of luck to you.<br /><br /><br />One more thing, check out a video on YouTube called &quot;It Gets Better&quot;. It&#039;s about gay kids who were pushed to suicide, but I think it is very meaningful to anyone depressed or considering suicide.

				I have social anxiety. I take zoloft and it helps. Don&#039;t give up on psychotropic drugs just because they don&#039;t work for some people. Talking to a therapist helps more though, trust me, they have degrees in helping people.

				I&#039;ve had social anxiety all my life. For many people there is an event that triggers it but for me it was something I was born with. My earliest memories of me as a child is that I would not talk to anyone. Teachers in elementary school thought my parents were beating me because I was so quiet. Now I&#039;m 28 and I&#039;m still the same person I was back then. Honestly I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll ever be able to overcome it since it&#039;s always been apart of my world. Benzos can make some days easier but people can easily tell I&#039;m on something.&nbsp; But some days I just don&#039;t want to deal with it.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				In 1969 I entered a mental hospital with schizophrenic episodes. That is, I would communicate normally, intelligently (I had the lowest average in my high school to win a Regents Scholarship) and then breakdown into such a vulnerable mass of anxiety that I was incommunicative and incoherent; audio hallucinating alot into delusionary architecture, and some visual hallucinations as well. I&#039;ve spent 50 years re-integrating without psychoactive drugs (atypicals, SSRI, benzodiazepeens, etc), but it has been a ride through hell. As for much of the advice given above, if you&#039;re getting up and physically fleeing situations, you&#039;re way past the point many here can relate to, and while cutting out caffeine, exercising and Valerian Root all have their positive applications, you may need to go &#039;all the way in&#039; in order to get out and find your peace. <br /><br />There is an &quot;Observation Exercise&quot; by Roy Masters and can be found at www.fhu.com called &quot;Be Still and Know&quot; - theyll send it to you for free if you dont have $ call them at their 800 number. <br />It allows you to separate the thoughts (which are controlling and dominating your mind at the time of your panic) from your emotions. It is WITHIN YOU, and it is not easy to use this simple but unending-ly deep meditation. No, its not &quot;Ooum, nor Buddha, etc.&quot; Give it a try. I think its a $10 download, and it&#039;s difficult in its simplicity at the beginning.<br />If you want to see some interesting work on schizophrenia, check out www.doctordeborahnadel.com&quot;

For major depression those would be the treatment of choice, but for mild cases of axiety/depression i feel they often do more harm then good. They will make you miserable when on then, and again when weening off. <br /><br />They truly are two completely different categories of drugs. Benzo&#039;s can work very well for anxiety, at least making you feel better while you are on them. This benefit isn&#039;t lost that rapidly either - the sedative/narcotic properties will be over in a couple of weeks, but the anxiolytic effects often last much longer (up to the rest of your life in case of xanax). You will, however, experience withdrawal effects when you stop treatment.<br /><br />This begs the question which is worse though: Being miserable from the start to end of a treatment, but not addicted in the traditional sense, or experiencing great relief at the onset of treatment, but withdrawal problems at the end. The withdrawal part being voluntary too, since it wouldn&#039;t be problematic to keep taking something like xanax for the rest if your life, just like many people need blood pressure or cholesterol lowering agents for life - noone questions the sanity of that though,

				I suppose thats another matter entirely. <br /><br />The choice between living a shorter life that includes vices like drinking, smoking and drugs versus a longer one that requires abstaining from all those is everyone&#039;s personal choice. <br /><br />I may see that as a choice between having another 25 of years of fun, or another 50 boring years, both ending in death after those periods of time. For me the choice clearly goes to option #1, but i&#039;m not required to care for others either, so my choice in the matter doesn&#039;t adversely effect others like children. <br /><br />I suppose this choice deserves a thread of its own though.<br /><br />Personally i&#039;d prefer to experience the most of life, no matter if that is concentrated in a shorter timeframe compared to maximum lifespan available. I&#039;d rather crash a plane into a mountain at age 50 then, compared to living another 40 years of which the last 20 are spent withering away in some seniors facility.

Anyone ever had brainzaps first few days after you seriously overdid MDMA, on AD&#039;s these start at day2 when i stopped and lasted almost 2 weeks.<br />Been recently been prescribed solian in the lowest dose, (high doses are for surpessing psychotic symptoms. Does something to my dopamine system at low dose. So far its been the best drug for my social anxiety.<br />Its not totally gone, never will be i accept that, but i feel alot less restricted in public area&#039;s and crowds. I stopped feeling watched and overheared all the time and i have alot more energy cause of this. (not FDA approved drug in USA)<br />None of these drugs i would EVER describe as personality changing or altering.<br />Ive been on a much heavier antipsychotic few years back and that one did make me feel not myself and totally zombied me, but your standard AD&#039;s do little more then taking the edge off emotions and stabilizing your mood. You feel like yourself almost all the time, you might notice you react different, calmer in spots but thats it. <br />In retrospect i would think VERY hard about starting with the AD&#039;s, only use when SEVERE depression leaves you no choice. For social anxiety is found them pretty much useless<br />Ive never used benzo&#039;s for my anxiety attacks, relaxation and breathing techniques have me feeling in control over them and since then they only occur VERY sporadic.<br />Therapy is VERY helpfull if your fed up enough to WANT to change. Behaviourall therapy is quite hard and intense especially at first, but in the end its the best cure imo.<br />Benzo&#039;s are real additcive and the same thing happens as with the AD&#039;s , after a while your brain is wired to work with them so stopping means relapse, not to mention addiction wtihdrawl.<br />In short go see a therapist and tell you prefer not to starts with AD&#039;s .<br />As for recreational drugs, only very small therapheutic doses of amphetamines seemed to help me. <br />Taking recreational doses and staying up nights will worsen the anxiety and for me it took 3 years to get from social anxiety but functioning to a very mild psychotic break and socially disfunctional (i could see i was delusional, apparantly that&#039;s rare)

				I&#039;ve been on prescription ssri&#039;s (citalopram) too, as a treatment for anxiety. For me, they had very little if any beneficial effect, but that is to be expected as these drugs are not intended for treating that ailment at all. I was, at that time, aware of that and willing to take the chance and see if they had any effect regardless though. <br /><br />Downside is that i did get all the expected side effects, including apathy and some sexual dysfunctional problems as well. Luckily all of that faded quite quickly after tapering down from them and quitting them altogether over a period of about 6 weeks. Also, i found the initial symptoms very unpleasant, a feeling for being on coke and valium at the same time without seeing any cause apart from the start of ssri treatment. <br /><br />The whole ordeal lasted perhaps half a year for me, but i can imagine it can take much longer than that for others to decide giving up that route of treatment entirely. <br /><br />Before experiencing it first hand i always thought that regularly prescribed ssri&#039;s were relatively benign drugs and that their side effects were mostly exaggerated. I&#039;ve changed my mind entirely since then though. Benzo&#039;s may be addictive, but somehow benzo dependence seems like a much less unpleasant condition than ssri treatment. <br /><br />Obviously this is only on experience where the main indication was anxiety, not depression. In cases of serious depression ssri&#039;s will prove to be very functional medications despite their side effects, and i would not want to suggest anyone against taken them when prescribed on solid medical grounds.
