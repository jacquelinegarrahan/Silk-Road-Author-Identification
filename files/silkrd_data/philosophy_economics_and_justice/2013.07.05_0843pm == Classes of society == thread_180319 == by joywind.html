				Working class people often have good instincts and are basically moral but they&#039;re too limited to really be friends with. These guys all only have one topic - usually something like cars and repairing cars or fixing machines or the nuances of HVAC design and repair. I don&#039;t really have anything to say to these guys. Non-white proletarians sometimes are better in this regard. Moslem proles want to talk to people who they think know about religion, Korean proles often are interested in stuff they think is &#039;&#039;manly&#039;&#039; or important in cultural or political terms. White proles find themselves kind of rudderless. This is part of the problem.<br /><br />Middle class people generally I find to be effeminate and bizarre. I don&#039;t mean &#039;&#039;effeminate&#039;&#039; is some half-assed macho, disdainful way. I mean they really do come off like middle aged ladies in their interests, views, emotional states and the like.<br /><br />I also realized I have a weird frame of reference. My formative experiences were odd - I don&#039;t mean that in some egoistic way; I realize I succumbed to a lot of pathological impulses. I just spent college being fixated on things like political theory/&#039;&#039;extremism&#039;&#039;, got fixated on weights and bodybuilding (which itself is prole), lost my family early, fell down the rabbit hole with heroin. I have a hard time taking middle class people seriously. They&#039;re largely immune to tragedy, they have childish conceptual biases. <br /><br />This chick that I used to fuck married a high-flying guy who ended up with a seat at the board of trade. One time he told me about losing his job with a big firm around 2000/2001 when a lot went bust. He says, &#039;&#039;I don&#039;t know how I survived it&#039;&#039;. This guy thinks living a little bit lean for a few months and suffering a blow to the ego is an issue of mortal trauma. I mean, that kind of thing is silly beyond belief but this is how these people think. <br /><br />Middle-class shit-liberals ruined the Pacific Northwest too - but that was largely complete by the late 1990s. The coast is fine there, cities are done. Portland used to be a real working-class city with a reasonably diversified tertiary economy and the like. Now its some playground for androgynous white losers with too much money who want to live out a perpetual adolescence.

				i wouldn&#039;t give a crap about money / class but the problem is there tends to be better people to associate with the higher you move up the spectrum and for that reason and that reason alone I am forced to care about money. working class people etc as you mentioned are the most boring unintelligent low minded thinkers ever and I can&#039;t spend more than a few minutes around them unless they are randomly super funny/nice which is a pretty rare subgroup.

				I agree with little of the original post, and will share my thoughts on those points only, for that others may find some common thread for discussion. My comments on the middle class are very generalized, I recognize, and of course do not apply to everyone. They only apply to the typical majority of the American middle class that, when you read, will come right to mind. You know the type.<br />--<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=180319.msg1308381#msg1308381">Quote from: joywind on July 05, 2013, 08:43 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Middle class people generally I find to be effeminate and bizarre.

To them here&#039;s how it goes: If you aren&#039;t with them, you&#039;re weird, and not in the good way. You&#039;re a vegetarian in a community where Thanksgiving is a celebrated holiday? Well you&#039;re the star focal point of conversation every year. You become educated enough to understand the inherent problems with a capitalist society becoming globalized? Better not ever mention it, &#039;cause these are the kinds of people that will either regard you as an childish radical (and yet have no idea what you&#039;re taking about), or they regard you intelligent merely because they have no idea what you&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />Middle class people trying too hard to be high(er) class, or trying too hard just to be middle class. They&#039;ve found a template for their life, and they&#039;re doing everything they can with all the money they have and much that they don&#039;t to fit into it. Boring, unoriginal, uncreative, and yet they believe their lives to be so much the opposite. In this way, yes, I recognize what joywind is saying, and agree with the above quotation, at least in part.<br /><br /><br />Also, it&#039;s Muslim, not &quot;Moslem.&quot;

				haha!<br /><br />i mostly agree with OP.<br /><br />i am of lower class but am one of the exceptional that follows few norms.<br /><br />i find most people boring &amp; repetative regardless of class. they all try to hard to either embody the stereotypical mindset of their &#039;class&#039; or to step up a notch and its funny to watch.<br /><br />i rarely drink so am auto weird to most, yet i see the panto for what it is not what its supposed to be and it can be quite lonely at times. (laughing at the wrong time etc)<br /><br />i pity the cellphone addicted, kandy krush playing masses yet find myself drawn more &amp; more into my own head (&amp; computer)for intellectual company.<br /><br />
