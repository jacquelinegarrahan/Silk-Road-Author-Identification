				Inspired by this thread:<br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=201514.0<br /><br />The DSM-IV requires at least three of the following symptoms present during a 12 month period for a diagnoses of polysubstance dependence.<br />-Tolerance: Use of increasingly high amounts of a substance or they find the same amount less and less effective ( the amount has to be at least 50% more of the original amount needed.)<br />-Withdrawal: Either withdrawal symptoms when drug stops being used or the drug is used to prevent withdrawal symptoms.<br />-Loss of control: Repeated use of more drugs than planned or use of the drugs over longer periods of time than planned.<br />-Inability to stop using: Either unsuccessfully attempted to cut down or stop using the drugs or a persistent desire to stop using.<br />-Time: Spending a lot of time obtaining drugs, using drugs, being under the influence of drugs, and recovering from the effects of drugs.<br />-Interference with activities: Give up or reduce the amount of time involved in recreational activities, social activities, and/or occupational activities because of the use of drugs.<br />-Harm to self: Continuous use of drugs despite having a physical or psychological problem caused by or made worse by the use of drugs.<br /><br />If one (such as myself) uses a variety of drugs but does not fit these criteria, do you think it is a problem or would you consider it the same as someone that collects various wines and enjoys different ones at different times?

				I use a variety and am not physically addicted to any one substance. Specifically, I tend to rotate between benzos (mixed with alcohol) opiates, and amphetamines. However, if I don&#039;t take something at night I can&#039;t sleep and if I run out of drugs I get really fucking anxious and depressed. I don&#039;t need drugs to function, but I know for certain that my mind constantly craves drugs and goes a bit crazy without them.

				I love the sound of Polydrug Connoisseur!<br />Has a wonderful ring to it, to be sure. <br /><br />I was just thinking about this the other day because as I&#039;ve grown older and matured, I&#039;ve left behind many of the friends that regularly use drugs (i.e. smoke weed all day, trip every weekend or every other weekend, roll at all the clubs, etc) and have entered into a more professional atmosphere where drug use is hidden for the most part. People would probably never guess that I had a large (personal) cache of a wide variety of substances in a special safe. As a result, I wondered how that might be perceived. Is our society becoming less stigmatizing of those who are &quot;drug enthusiasts&quot; or are we still just drug packrats, waiting for a rainy day to just eat the entire drug stockpile and go out in a blaze of (not-so-much) receptor-frying glory? <br /><br />Either way, I have decided that I will gladly refer to myself as a Polydrug Connoisseur. It is with great care and interest that I procure rare chemicals such as AL-LAD or 3-MMC, or novelties such as Cher&#039;s 130 ug microdots. Other drugs are luxuries, such as opium or poppy tea for a special lazy day at home or ketamine, for high-class depression treatment and dissociative fun. The list goes on and on, my friends. As I move forward in life, I sometimes worry what it will be like if I decide to marry a non-drug user and how I will be able to explain this collection. But it can&#039;t be too much different from having a gun collection as long as the owner (me) isn&#039;t getting into the safe every evening. :)<br /><br />For your viewing pleasure...<br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/4IaQ.jpg<br />From Left-to-right: Poppy tea, GHB, DMT, bk-MDMA (Methylone), 50/50 mix of 3-MMC and S-iso Ketamine, S-iso Ketamine, 2 vials with 3-MMC, Opium, Blacked-out baggie with 11 tabs AL-LAD inside, 100mg MDA, 5 microdots LSD.&nbsp; 8) ;D<br /><br />http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/dL6Q.jpg<br />Microdots close-up

It started out as self-medicating; I have a family history of clinical depression and I would rather do things the way I do them than take SSRIs (nothing against people that choose to do that). Other drugs are fun and I have a purpose for each one. Amphetamines to get shit done and benzos to come down, opiates to just relax all day on the weekend. <br /><br />Anyway, I have been a polydrug abuser or addict or whatever for several years now and so far it has had a positive impact on my life. I no longer want to blow my brains out and my drug use is pretty much a secret except to a few close friends.&nbsp;

				I think the only addictive trait for drugs and me are to acquire them..&nbsp; if I don&#039;t have any I tend to bug out a bit like someone who is jonesing for drugs.. but when I have a bunch I don&#039;t really take them all the time.. sometimes just leave them stashed for a long time. <br /><br />

Plan ahead.<br />Health concerns: Depending on your use, maybe you should be concerned as well. If you know what you are doing, than share this knowledge. <br />You becoming an addict: It could happen, be open about your feelings and put some controls in place.<br />With kids this is all a bigger issue, especially the house part.<br /><br />So yeah there is no way I would marry someone that I had to hide a secret that big from.

To get me to admit to my current drug use, well that is not easy.<br /><br />So to answer your question, I think drug stigma is thriving, but maybe you can do some good with the people around you at least. <br /><br />Also. Society segregates people who have been convicted of crimes. Since drug users fall in this category, people will look down on them. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=206610.msg1485428#msg1485428">Quote from: zipstyle on August 24, 2013, 02:56 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"> As I move forward in life, I sometimes worry what it will be like if I decide to marry a non-drug user and how I will be able to explain this collection. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />As far as I&#039;m concerned, this is something that must be tackled. The legit concerns they would have that I can understand would be:<br />Having them in the house/legal trouble: Since you&#039;re reading these forums, you should be able to figure out how to mitigate this risk greatly. Plan ahead.<br />Health concerns: Depending on your use, maybe you should be concerned as well. If you know what you are doing, than share this knowledge. <br />You becoming an addict: It could happen, be open about your feelings and put some controls in place.<br />With kids this is all a bigger issue, especially the house part.<br /><br />So yeah there is no way I would marry someone that I had to hide a secret that big from.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Wow, a truly great response, AllDayLong. Exactly the kind of discussion I was hoping for and more! Thanks very much for giving me your insight on this. <br />I think you present several good points, especially the fact that regardless of how one performs in society, there will be some judgement due to stigma. <br />It would be nice if one could be totally open about these sorts of things, but sadly the world is not so accepting yet.
