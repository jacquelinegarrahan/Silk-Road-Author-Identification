				Has anyone here given up on voting altogether ??<br />Here in the uk there was a vote regarding who should be in your local police commission.<br />And guess what, it was a fail from start to finish.<br />For this reason i have just given up voting on a national basis.<br /><br />Does anyone else have a reason as to why they do, or do not vote?

				I live in a country where voting is compulsory.&nbsp; I&#039;ve always believed it shouldn&#039;t be compulsory, but recently I&#039;ve changed my mind and now believe it should be compulsory but you should have the option to opt out at the ballot box.<br /><br />However, like in a customer survey you should say why.<br />

Enough people doing it couldn&#039;t be ignored. By not voting at all you can be safely ignored.<br /><br />

The media mainly ignore them but that&#039;s because the lib/lab/con government own nearly all the newspapers and the BBC don&#039;t report their success much either for some reason. They&#039;re the 3rd biggest party now based on PCC votes and their leader (Nigel Farage) has some hilarious youtube videos and he makes some very good points.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And he survived a plane crash, that man is hard as nails.<br /><br />I don&#039;t vote anymore, defaced my ballot paper in police elections because i don&#039;t think any of the choices are good enough and were all affiliated with the 4 political party&#039;s. Would have gone for it myself if id of had a spare £5000 to register.<br /><br />I decided that it was pointless when that politician was selling access to PM for £250,000, i have some great ideas for government but no way of getting heard, the MP are only interested in talking around election time, so unless you have £250,000 or are a lobbyist for a major corporation you may as well not have a voice.<br /><br />I do involve myself in lots of community projects, that way i can have a say in my immediate surroundings and with those who directly effect me.

				Easy answer<br /><br />CLEAR - Cannabis Law Reform<br />https://en-gb.facebook.com/ClearUK (99% sure this is the correct fb url)<br />www.clear.co.uk<br /><br />Btw, Nigel, Leader of UKIP wants to do a royal commission to the queen about addressing the &#039;Cannabis Issue&#039;, wanting to decriminalise it. Which is good, but NOT the same as legalised.<br /><br />CLEAR want to legalise it (similar to Colorado, but a 18+ age req)

				Thanks for pointing me in the direction of UKIP!!!.<br />This may well be my next choice of vote.&nbsp; Although, there is a bit of a stink kicking off in the uk about them apparently as they are being accused of racism.<br />I guess we will have to keep our eyes and ears open and see how this plays out.

				This is one of the reasons why i hate Rupert Murdoch (media) in general because if one person of such power wants to discredit a party, all they have to do is pick up the phone, make a call to the BBC and they will report anything they are told to.<br /><br />Not cool.
