				T= D / W * (-H)<br /><br />Time<br />Drugs<br />Wanted Drugs<br />Hours Since Ordered<br /><br />Time equals the amount of drugs you have divided by the amount of drugs on order multiplied by the number of hours that have passed since you ordered.<br /><br />The end result is the factor by which time has sped up or slowed down for you. In my case, I have 0 drugs and am waiting for a lot of drugs and have been sitting here for days waiting for them to get here. As an example, it&#039;s about 3:15 AM right now and has been for the last two hours. My mail man will get here in 14 hours which by my estimation will take approximately 17.6 eternities in my current relativistic space time frame.<br /><br />Of course, we still need to deal with the quantum aspect of the equation which dictates that my drugs may not even be in my mail box until I actually open it to check which suggests that they could be in there right now even though I know the mail man hasn&#039;t been by...<br /><br />Sorry, had to run downstairs and check. Still no mail.<br /><br />Oh god... I need to rework the formula... I just looked at the clock and it&#039;s 3:09 AM now... time has begun to creep backwards...<br /><br />Waiting sucks!<br />

				Yeah I agree waiting sucks shit and time slows down when you wait. That post was fucking funny though. Going to sleep does help though it makes time skip ahead.

				LOL... this is why I still fucking love this place.&nbsp; You&#039;re spectacular, Diamond.&nbsp; Don&#039;t ever change :)<br /><br /><br />P.S. - maybe you could find a nearby Black Hole and sit just outside the event horizon -- gotta be one somewhere around here, right?

				Just be glad you are not having to account for relativistic velocities or extreme gravitational wells with that equation. That could get messy.

				I think the most stunning aspect of this time dilation theory is that it is provable simply by the administration of drugs at which point time inevitably speeds up and continues to race forward until you are out of drugs. Knowing what I know now, if my doctor told me I had one week to live I would immediately go home, destroy my stash and order 100 pounds of cocaine / MDMA / pot which in effect should allow me to live forever.<br /><br />Of course the mail man came and went today.<br /><br />I think he knows that I am waiting for something. I guess most people don&#039;t sit by their mailbox in the middle of winter rocking back and forth in the snow as they yell down the street &quot;Hurry Up!&quot;<br /><br />It&#039;s going to be okay though. I&#039;ve got a new plan. I&#039;m going to build a time machine. I got the plans off a Family Guy episode and just need to track down a working flux capacitor and I&#039;ll be all set. I&#039;m going to go back in time one month and steal the drugs out of my mail box and bring them back to the future...<br /><br />Oh shit... what if that&#039;s already happened and my future self is getting high on my current self&#039;s stash?<br /><br />Well... one more day. It&#039;s going to get here. Have to wait till next week to get rolling now though. My wife has issues doing large quantities of drugs on a work night and only getting 3 hours of Valium induced slumber before having to suffer through eight hours of barely being sober only to come home and see me still sleeping.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				That equation or theory you started off with, hurt my brain to just try and consider. <br /><br />Could be crashing from the speed. <br /><br />Though I can&#039;t put it in such techonerd terms (I say that affectionately)<br /><br />I do understand the whole mailbox obsession, as most do that have been on here for a few months. <br /><br />Unless you were joking about the &#039;waiting around the mailbox&#039; thing, I would advise against even appearing to be anticipating the mail delivery. <br /><br />Then again, I could be stalling you by making you read this, meanwhile I&#039;m in my time machine stealing your mail! <br /><br />Sometimes it seems an eternity. Then you get that one day, like I got recently. On Monday, wasn&#039;t expecting 1 thing. - I got 3 things! <br /><br />1- Order that shouldn&#039;t have come till like Wednesday based on how far away it was coming from. <br />2- Order that had been re-shipped due to customs interception. - It was passed due, and the seller and I both figured they got it again. - That came,.<br />3- An order that a vendor cancelled on me after 4 days sitting &#039;in processing&#039;&nbsp; - That was a freebee worth about $50 !!<br /><br />I&#039;m still in a good mood from Monday!<br /><br />Stick around, you&#039;ll get one of those days too, that makes up for all the others that made you half-crazy!<br /><br />Peace<br /><br />jagfug<br /><br />

				ohhhh my...I laughed really hard when I saw this. I&#039;m a undergrad physics major and agree wholeheartedly with what you said. Thank you for making my day! If I could give out karma I&#039;d +1 the shit outta you
