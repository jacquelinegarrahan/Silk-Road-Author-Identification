				When is it good to let your emotions get the best of you?<br /><br />Is it ever good to let this happen?<br /><br />I&#039;m a firm believer that the lack of control of ones emotions causes the greatest pain.&nbsp; Example, crimes of passion, emotional scars, etc.<br /><br />Thoughts?

				Going to have to think about this a bit. I certainly value being able to keep my emotions under control, but I&#039;ve also seen other people make use of the semi-controlled loss of control. I personally could never do it any more, when I lose it, things are going badly for sure. Interesting topic to ponder!

				Power is also an Emotion. One that makes the powerful lie, kill, murder and spread ignorance to keep the &quot;feeling&quot; of power.&nbsp; Just look at our churches and politics, many mean good, but the few grasping power cause great disruption to our evolution... :)

				I think emotions are just indicators of whether what we&#039;re doing is right or wrong.

				Emotions control how we think.&nbsp; Emotions are more powerful than thought.. So much so, emotions can give us the greatest joy, or the greatest pain. When you are able to direct your emotions and alter them from thought -you will develop true wisdom. <br /><br />I don&#039;t think one can say emotions are good or bad, If you have no control over emotions, your unbalanced..&nbsp; I also think your unbalanced if your a cold person with absolutely no emotion, a dead personality.

You can feel emotionally about a relationship, even if that relationship is having a negative effect on your life. Emotions do not always steer you in the right direction. Time and thought can clear away the clouds created by emotion in your mind.

				I&#039;m not sure what to think about emotions personally, but I can say a lot of relationships...whether romantic, friendly, or familial...can all be stifled by holding back your emotions.&nbsp; Especially for men, we have this Tough Guy/John Wayne image that&#039;s perpetuated thru the media, sports, etc. where we can&#039;t show emotion, or be vulnerable.&nbsp; &nbsp;That if we do so, it somehow makes us &quot;less of a man&quot;&nbsp; or &quot;effeminate.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Which is all just ridiculous, but that&#039;s the society we live in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Women, on the other hand, who are more adept and comfortable showing their emotions...they get stereotyped as well, as being &quot;too emotional, too dramatic, too much drama&quot; etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So the enforced stereotypes work both ways...they hinder all of us from having authentic, real relationships with people.&nbsp; We end up being guarded, stilted, and usually only show our real emotions when we&#039;re fucked up on alcohol or drugs, ironically.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;:P&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t know, just my take I guess..... ;)
