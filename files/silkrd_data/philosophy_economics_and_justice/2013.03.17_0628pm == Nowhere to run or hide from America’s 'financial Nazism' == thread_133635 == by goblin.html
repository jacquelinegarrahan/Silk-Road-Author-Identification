				http://rt.com/op-edge/us-spy-agencies-monitor-finances-nazi-311/<br /><br />Nowhere to Run or Hide from America’s &#039;Financial Nazism&#039;<br /><br />By Max Keiser<br /><br />March 16, 2013 &quot;Information Clearing House&quot; -&quot;RT&quot; - ‘Nazi Germany’ is the phrase that immediately comes to mind from the recent reports that the US is planning to allow spy agencies to monitor every citizen’s finances.<br /><br />When you read a sentence like, &quot;The Obama administration is drawing up plans to give all US spy agencies full access to a massive database that contains financial data on American citizens and others who bank in the country,&quot; the pieces begin to fall into place. Remember how last year we learned that hedge funds hire former and active CIA agents to do research (read: espionage) to give them an edge?<br /><br />Now, we understand that Eric Holder won&#039;t investigate or prosecute bankers and private equity funds for fear it might destabilize the economy (read: he&#039;s scared of them). The bottom line is that private equity and hedge funds – a massive, multi-trillion-dollar pool of unregulated, opaque capital controlled by corrupt insiders on Wall Street and Washington – have been given carte blanche to spy on people. That and, as was the case with JP Morgan and MF Global, steal money from customer accounts and use any information they glean to trade on inside information and manipulate markets with impunity.<br /><br />For those who say, “Let them spy, I have nothing to hide!” I point your attention to 1938’s Kristallnacht, when the government of Hitler&#039;s Nazi Germany gave the all-clear for jackbooted thugs to rape, pillage and plunder with impunity. We now stand at a similar turning point: The financial-holocaust-provokers on Wall Street and the City of London have been given the all clear-sign from Washington and Number 10 to commit financial rape, pillage and plunder, with full cooperation and assistance from their respective intelligence communities.<br /><br />Is it any wonder that a crypto currency like Bitcoin is now a half-billion-dollar currency that is growing exponentially, or that Kim Dotcom&#039;s Mega, an entirely encrypted site, is now starting to dominate the Internet?<br /><br />Back in the 1930s, people had to flee Nazi Germany and run to countries where human rights like privacy were respected. Today, with a global banking and intelligence cartel spying on all communications and transactions everywhere, people are fleeing to Bitcoin and Mega.<br /><br />Max Keiser, the host of RT&#039;s ‘Keiser Report,’ is a former stockbroker, the inventor of virtual specialist technology and co-founder of the Hollywood Stock Exchange.

				To say that this is an embarassment for me as an American in a gross understatement. Nazi America is indeed what the USA is (has) become. I personally wish people (in the USA) would quit voting for Republicans AND Democrats because they both suck - F-- is their grade, and both parties need to vanish completely as neither have any inkling of what freedom is. One thinks freedom is to make all the money you can (off the backs of the poor), and the other embraces every form of fucked-up, nutty insane liberal bullshit one can imagine. I wish we had a lot more government leaders like Ron Paul (there are a couple of others, but that&#039;s about it) who espouse government staying the hell out of the citizendrie&#039;s lives. I hope it doesn&#039;t take another Civil War to do that...
