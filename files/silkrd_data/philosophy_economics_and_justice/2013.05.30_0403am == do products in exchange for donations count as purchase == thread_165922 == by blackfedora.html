				Donor is the word you&#039;re looking for &amp; it depends on whether or not you actively intended to gain something out of the donation.

In a legal sense the advertised price of any product is simply an invitation to treat, meaning an invitation to you to pay X amount for the product in question. The advertised price - being an invitation to treat - is therefore open to a counter-invitation to treat for a lower price etc.<br /><br />Calling the price paid for a product you receive a &quot;donation&quot; does not change the fact that you are engaging in a trade, namely that you have offered the owner of the product an invitation to treat by stating that you will &quot;donate&quot; (read: &#039;pay&#039;) X amount if he/she will give you the product, or the owner of the product has offered you an invitation to treat if you will &quot;donate&quot; (read: &#039;pay&#039;) X amount for it.<br /><br />The scenario that you mentioned is the underlying principle of any trade on any market.<br /><br />Libertas
