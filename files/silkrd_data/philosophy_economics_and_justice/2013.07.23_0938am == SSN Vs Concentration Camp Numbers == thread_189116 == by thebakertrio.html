				Yes, Social Security Numbers and concentration camp numbers are similar in that they are both numbers assigned to people.<br /><br />And that pretty much ends the similarity between concentration camps and modern life in America.<br />

				if Hitler really wanted to exterminate the jews there would be no survivors from the concentration camps. He had complete power to do whatever the fuck he wanted. He did the smart thing, and used them as slave laborers - the whole genocide thing is complete bullshit. The reason why the jews that were found were starving was because the rail lines were cut and were unable to get much food to german citizens, let alone the parasitic jews in the camps. The allies spread the whole holocaust bullshit to make the nazis seem so evil, because other than the fact that Hitler wanted control over Europe, the Nazi&#039;s were the best race to ever live, and they did not want people to realize that. Hitler and the NSDAP became the boogeyman of the 20th century. Look at all the technology and innovations they created, no single country could defeat them - it basically took the whole fucking world to defeat them. the US even stole their scientists to build the a-bomb.&nbsp; The new world that was created after WWII stole many of the ideals the Germans started.

				they are more similar than people realize.&nbsp; Shit, both your SSN and concentration camp victims where identified by algorithms of number created by IBM.&nbsp; Wallstreet and american business helped fund the nazi movement -and thats putting it lightly.&nbsp; &nbsp;nowadays the indoctrination and genocide is more sophisticated and intelligent -instead of brute force; they use of psychology.&nbsp; <br /><br />anyone&nbsp; think eugenics isn&#039;t alive and very strong today?&nbsp; your mistaken, just look the average fat fuck idiot walking around in walmart or a prison complex.&nbsp; We all know, or should know the bush&#039;s and nazi&#039;s where one in the same family and business partners.&nbsp; Most people aren&#039;t familiar with hidden history, they have been dumbed down to the status of zombies through food, school, and other forms of propaganda.&nbsp; you fuckers that don&#039;t know real history, thats your stupid fault, do the research or forever stfu.

				Well, I suppose assigning every person in a country a unique number is a little dehumanizing, but I think it is different from concentration camp numbers because we are more than the number. We still have a name, and a gender, an ethnicity, etc. In concentration camps, you were not John Smith with SSN 222-22-2222; you were Prisoner #334434, period. <br /><br />Good question. Food for thought.
