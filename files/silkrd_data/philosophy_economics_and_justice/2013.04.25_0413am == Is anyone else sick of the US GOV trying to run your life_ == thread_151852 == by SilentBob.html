				I have been in a deep depression during that last few months over the state of the US government. Everyday I watch TV, read the newspaper, and turn on the radio just to hear of another new law they are trying to pass. I will list a few examples but they will barely scratch the surface of this growing problem. <br /><br />New York and Mr Bloomburg have and are trying everything from moving the legal age to purchase&nbsp; cigarettes to 21, to controlling the amount of soda you can get at one time, to how loud your headphones will get in your ears. Of course it doesn&#039;t stop with New York, Colorado is on the for front of the new gun laws, Starting with how many rounds of ammunition you are allowed to have in a magazine at one time to that you are not allowed to share your gun with a fellow shooter at a shooting range. California and San Fransisco has got a law against oral sex. Yup it true. At the federal level it gets even worse. <br /><br />So I guess my question is this: Is there anyone else out there who is feed up with the Government (state or federal) telling you what you can and cannot do? Why is it that they feel like they know whats better for me than I do? Where will it stop? Will it stop? I just want to know that I am not alone in this and that there are other people who get sick every time they see a new law going into affect.<br /><br />Maybe I am just crazy. But it sure feels like they want to control every aspect of my life.

				You aren&#039;t crazy and you definitely aren&#039;t alone. It&#039;s really starting to fuck with my mood, sometimes I think everything I&#039;m working towards is pointless because we are going to be living in a surveillance state soon enough anyway. I don&#039;t believe they are ever going to stop. It fills me with the most incredible sense of dread to know that people can be so selfish and evil.

				Totally with you. I think the American people need to wake up start standing up for their rights. America is no longer a republic, it&#039;s a dictatorship. The constitution is trampled on a daily basis. I can&#039;t tell if people don&#039;t realize what&#039;s going on, or they just don&#039;t care. <br /><br />&quot;Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.‚Äù<br />- Benjamin Franklin

				Of course they can see what is going on. But they are brainwashed so badly that their view of reality is highly distorted. The average US citizen is constantly subjected to relentless propaganda. The US is a democratic republic, but some smart sociopaths have found the weakness of this form of governing. Enough people are so easily manipulated that it becomes information warfare. The people who control the propaganda control the minds of the people who control the government. Government propaganda controls the people who ostensibly control the government. It has turned into a de facto dictatorship in this way. There are a few different factions who struggle with each other to control the people, but they are all united in being hardline statists. On one hand we have the religious people, primarily conservative republicans. They are brainwashed with religion and patriotism. On the other hand we have the socialists, primarily liberal democrats, they are brainwashed by the subverted education system and a malignant desire to &#039;help others&#039;. They are indoctrinated in so many ways. From the flags waving everywhere you look, people on every news station of television telling them how to think and interpret events, shows on television trying to mold them into an image, the preachers at churches interpreting the holy books for them, the institutes of education mixing propaganda in with the real knowledge they teach to them and more, the list of channels through which they are bombarded with manipulation goes on and on. They are human drones, programmed devices, and the programmers program them in such a way that they will give power to their masters. <br /><br />The Internet is a great tool for fighting this propaganda bombardment. Purely broadcast media is for brainwashing people, multicast is for educating people. But of course the government is even starting to spread their propaganda in sophisticated ways on the internet, using software that allows single agents to manage thousands of pseudonyms easily, to paint an incorrect and government favorable perception of public perception in public perception. <br /><br />Maybe it is impossible for us to stop this. It is only getting worse, the technologies and techniques they use more sophisticated. I become more and more convinced that violence is the only way to stop them. I think that the current government must be overthrown, and democracy abolished. In its place should be a totalitarian yet highly libertarian dictatorship. The people should not have any ability to use any process to remove the libertarian leaders from power. Nobody would have any rightful reason to contest such a political system, it would be the opposite of what is traditionally thought of as totalitarian. Statist totalitarianism is like Stalinism, Nazism, the current political system in North Korea, and to a large extent even the current government of countries like China. Libertarian totalitarianism is the exact opposite of this, there is a group in total power in that they cannot be removed from political power by the will of the people, but this group only protects the people from having their rights violated and being turned into slaves. Essentially the people must have choice removed from them when it comes to political things, and they must be forced into freedom. Normally you may think that people will naturally choose to be free and they do not require being forced into freedom. This may be true of an individual in a vacuum, but the issue is that people want to restrict the freedom of others. We must have a power structure put into place that can prevent the majority of people from victimizing the minorities. The current government slices the people into small groups and turns the large group against each of the smaller subsections it is composed of, and in this way they divide and they conquer.

Two people are put in front of you and you get to pick one, but it doesn&#039;t matter which one you pick because they all have the same agenda at the end of the day. <br />Forcing tyranny onto people doesn&#039;t work, so these smart people controlling things decided to manipulate everyone into agreeing to it. <br />I think the people make good choices - when they actually have a choice. <br /><br /><br /><br />

				Of course we&#039;re all fed up. It&#039;s the goddamned nanny state. They have to tell you what you can do, what you can&#039;t do, what you can put into your system, what you can allow your kid to do or not to do (you ever see those kids with helmets, padded all over, looking like a mini gladiator just to ride a scooter, fer chrissake?)<br /><br />And how much sugar you can get in a soda, and how you are banned from getting transfats in a burger? Fuck, who the hell cares if I want to intake some nice, fattening cholesterol units? It&#039;s my goddamned body, not the legislators!<br /><br />And I&#039;ve not even scratched the surface of the really opprobious things the guvmint does, like SPY on you without warrants, and maybe detain you without charges, or refuse to read you your Miranda rights, or even kill you without an undictment, a trial and a conviction.<br /><br />Or launch aggressive wars or, get this, &quot;kinetic actions&quot; (yeah, right, Ofuckma), all in our name.<br /><br />And the militarization of society (see how the Boston sheeple were cheering the police as they trampled all over their privacy rights the other day looking for ONE guy in a huge city? Anyone ready for tanks in the streets and helicopters over your neighborhood, all day and all night? Well, it&#039;s coming, unless we have a veritable revolution, people.<br /><br />goblin

They should have been in the streets protesting the fact that the military shut down a major city so that they could hunt down and kill two kids who haven&#039;t been convicted of anything. <br />And after all that, they still couldn&#039;t even find the 2nd kid. It was a citizen who found him after he was finally allowed out of his house.<br /><br />What about those black armored tank style vehicles they were driving down the streets. Why does the police department have military vehicles? That should be concerning to everyone. <br /><br />

				It&#039;s not just the USA. The nature of every power structure is that it will try to preserve itself while exerting the maximum amount of power possible. The burden is on the dissidents, the activists, the anarchists, and the critics to fight back and keep the powerful in check.

				Hell yeah! A better question would be is anyone content with their actions. Even the members of the government hate it they hate members of the opposition and members within their own sect and they will trade blood for money without even a second thought. They used to make compromises with corporations and other countries to get reelected now they do it so they wont be jailed or assassinated. <br /><br />I also watched both vids i liked the one by Serj better and never heard of him but i enjoy him now. thanks for that.<br /><br />Anyone else interested should check out &quot;all wars are bankers&#039; wars&quot; on YouTube. Scary Stuff but it&#039;ll really open your eyes.<br /><br />I believe a Revolution/Civil War is long overdue. Unfortunately I also believe it wont happen and probably by 2015 it cant happen because Americans will have no guns, be too fat and stupid (already there) and everyone will be too concerned with their personal well being (not going to jail or being killed etc.) that an armed revolution is completely off the table.<br /><br />Patrick Henry said &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; Today Americans say &quot;Give me my remote and my Big Mac and ill happily give you my tax dollars&quot;<br /><br />Well no more, I for one haven&#039;t paid taxes in years, I do not know how they haven&#039;t got to me yet, but i have a defense prepared in case they do, maybe they are trying to get me on something worse (hope not) but the day that LEO comes to my door to confiscate my rifle is the day you&#039;ll all see me on the 6 o&#039;clock news.<br /><br />FTP FTG long live freedom.

				Bill Maher said it best, we can have 10000 rounds of ammo and 5000 guns but the government has EVERYTHING else. if things got so bad and there were to be a group armed rising the government would just send a drone strike and that would be that. The 2nd amendment does not protect us from tyranny anymore, maybe in the 1800s but now? no fucking way. The government has planes, tanks, atom bombs, basically unlimited ammo and guns.. theres just no stopping it and it really is sad. its too late to do anything the pigs have what they need and theres nothing the american folk can do. Not to mention gov&#039;t has technology 50 years ahead of whats available to the public. Another point on my rant, its quite funny that no congressmen ever get cancer..there is a cure for it, just remeber cures don&#039;t make money, TREATING diseases makes money.. fucking scumbag pigs that make up our beloved capitalist system.. why is that? its just a shame the world we live in today

Everyday I watch TV, read the newspaper, and turn on the radio just to hear of another new law they are trying to pass. I will list a few examples but they will barely scratch the surface of this growing problem. <br /><br />New York and Mr Bloomburg have and are trying everything from moving the legal age to purchase&nbsp; cigarettes to 21, to controlling the amount of soda you can get at one time, to how loud your headphones will get in your ears. Of course it doesn&#039;t stop with New York, Colorado is on the for front of the new gun laws, Starting with how many rounds of ammunition you are allowed to have in a magazine at one time to that you are not allowed to share your gun with a fellow shooter at a shooting range. California and San Fransisco has got a law against oral sex. Yup it true. At the federal level it gets even worse. <br /><br />So I guess my question is this: Is there anyone else out there who is feed up with the Government (state or federal) telling you what you can and cannot do? Why is it that they feel like they know whats better for me than I do? Where will it stop? Will it stop? I just want to know that I am not alone in this and that there are other people who get sick every time they see a new law going into affect.<br /><br />Maybe I am just crazy. But it sure feels like they want to control every aspect of my life.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I know exactly how you feel regarding mainstream media getting you down etc. I am not from the US, but the Government here are trying to limit my freedom also. It is the same all over the World - Governments wanting to control their citizens by brainwashing them. My solution to this was to stop watching main stream news. I also stay away from news websites.<br /><br />My solution may not sound like much, but the more I detach from the bullshit, the happier I feel :)

				Corrupt government thrives because of the people.<br /><br />The truth is that people are passive, and just don&#039;t give a shit. &quot;Who cares if the govt are ruling everything, I&#039;ve got my beer and the game is on. After that I&#039;ll sleep with my wife, then I&#039;ve got work tomorrow. Game of thrones is on on Sunday, can&#039;t miss that.&quot;<br /><br />Even if shit gets bad, the most you get is Occupy WS. People rising up, in a way in which the system permits. Protesting, but not being heard. Then eventually everyone has to go home, and get on with their lives. They have to pay for food and water and shelter, and to live. Those at the top knew this would happen, that&#039;s why they remained conspicuously silent about it, and have done since.<br /><br />The brutal reality is that things will have to get really, really bad. Like mass starvation bad, before the people as a whole, start to do something about it. And when they do decide to really do something, they will have reached such levels of anger, that it will most likely be violent.<br /><br />

				Obama will be the coming week in Germany...probably getting his cock sucked by chancellor Angela Merkel.<br />The press stated that there will be discussions between both regarding the NSA affair.<br /><br />Since Angela Merkel was born in the former DDR (= Deutsche Demokratische Republik / GDR = German Democratic Republic) and I personally think of her, even though the Berlin Wall fell over 20 years ago,&nbsp; still having Stasi / fascist phantasies, I assume that she&#039;d like to get her hands on PRISM&#039;s data regarding German people, since her party, and not only her, are giving a fuck about the people&#039;s privacy etc.<br /><br />There are anti Obama demonstrations planed, I&#039;d love to see him at the Brandenburger Gate being told from the masses to fuck off.<br /><br />In my opinion, Obama has no fucking right coming to Germany, talking to the people and presenting himself as the saviour of the world.
