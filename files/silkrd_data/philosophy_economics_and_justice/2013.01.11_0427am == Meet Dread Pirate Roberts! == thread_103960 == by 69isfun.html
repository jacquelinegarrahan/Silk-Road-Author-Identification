				I saw an interview with pgp developer Phil Zimmermann, who explained that he was currently working on encrypted video conferencing and other services. I think it&#039;s being developed as commercial software, maybe SR will use something like this.<br />Zimmermann said some other things in the interview that were a bit strange though, i.e. I think he suggested hushmail as an alternative to pgp, without any caveat or warning whatsoever :-\

				If you video conference then choose your location carefully.<br /><br />UK Police developed some weird shit which can extrapolate the vibrations of energy cables in a video and through this and historic from electronic companies they can pinpoint location..it is experimental now but could become reality the more logs they got.<br /><br />WE cannot recoup the link right now but maybe somebody can help..<br /><br />CHeers!

				This is exciting stuff though.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can see both positive and negatives about SR&#039;s appearance at a open forum; however, it pleases me the most that DPR is willing to put SR even more boldly into the faces of LE.<br /><br />Eventually this sort of thing is going to be legitimized into the public realm, and as with SR, DPR is paving the road to acceptance!!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Not for such a stinky similarity, but when you buy a house near the dump, you can not stand the smell at first.&nbsp; But when your around it long enough, and it becomes common place, you just sort of get to accept it---------I hope this is the same---eventually as your budgets run lower and lower, and more sites and communities like SR pop up, you eventually got to face the fact that you live near the dump----so LE just accept that you guys are always going to smell the shit, and move on to bigger and more important issues than vice control:{

				At first I thought After seeing everyone talking about killing the delivery girl I thought it would be cool to have the messenger (wearing a Guy Fawkes mask) kill themselves after delivering the speech. See, that&#039;s how loyal our SR/DPR fanatics are. <br /><br />However I have a much much better idea, DPR this is for you: <br /><br />Hire an actor, a smart one who can learn and mimic the ideas and speech patterns of DPR, to portray DPR in all ways. Personify the mystery and live as a spokesman for the movement, do the morning shows, appear at all conferences, write books, make speeches, BE DPR without having any connection to the actual DPR or SR, not even own a computer. This guy would be untouchable. He would be trained, indoctrinated, and released into the wild. A fund of anonymous donations would be set up to pay for him.<br /><br />I am totally in love with this idea, who&#039;s with me?<br /><br />Modzi<br /><br /><br />cc DPR

This is how we decide whether or not to process your transaction :-D spring is right (as usual teehee). You should only offer that information to the vendor&#039;s that you feel safe sharing that with. Just sayin :-/ Also, if a seller wants to know your stats that badly, they can just send you a message asking you to place an order for a custom transaction (which is really kinda pointless lol). I don&#039;t see why you would want anyone else to know how much you spend on drugs. It&#039;s not exactly something most people boast about. Now being a star vendor is a completely different thing.
