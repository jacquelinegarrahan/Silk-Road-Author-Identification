				Gary Johnson is the way to go.&nbsp; You can sense that people are becoming more and more unhappy with the Republican and Democrat &quot;options&quot;.&nbsp; Heck I think Gary Johnson filed a lawsuit against the organization that limits the debate to two candidates.<br /><br />I think this is going to become a bigger and bigger issue as time goes on but essentially the two parties have control of the legislature so we might be stuck with the two party system until people get serious about changing it.&nbsp; Even then they will cling to their power.<br /><br />Aside from that I guess people are saying that Romney did better than Obama but I was surprised at how left-leaning Romney seemed.&nbsp; The two candidates really are interchangeable.

				Seems irrelevant as far as actual politics is concerned. Lobbyist are the ones calling the shots in this government. People focus on the main presidential candidates and assume that they are the men that hold the power, but no one contemplates just what goes into running a campaign. Where do you think the money for their campaigns comes from in the first place? While Romney is independently wealthy, he has no where near the financial standing to fund his campaign alone, and individual donations from political activists amounts to a very small portion of the overall donations.<br /><br />Instead, corporations see &quot;donations&quot; as a way to gain political leverage. They hire individuals known as lobbyists, and these lobbyists &quot;donate&quot; money to a certain campaign. However, there is no such thing as free money, and these &quot;donations&quot; are more or less bribes to political leaders to bend their policies in favor of the corporations interests in return for funding to run a campaign and gain the presidency.<br /><br />The presidency, in my eyes, is just a title of status. The phrase &quot;it&#039;s not what you know, but who you know&quot; can sum up a presidential candidate. Mitt Romney is well connected and has sold out to the right people, where as I can only relate Obama to a cinematic term &quot;the Manchurian Candidate&quot;. Not saying he is some sort of sleeper agent, but you get the picture.<br /><br />Whether Obama or Romney gets elected is irrelevant in a sense, at least in my eyes, due the nature of the U.S government.&nbsp; It&#039;s the people behind the scenes that are pulling the strings and calling the shots.<br /><br />In regards to your question, I view Obama as an inexperienced socialist leader that lacks the work ethic to hold the presidency. Do you know what time Obama leaves retires from his work at the White House each day? 5 o&#039;clock p.m. 5 O&#039;CLOCK! What in the fuck could you achieve in such a short work day, it&#039;s borderline psychotic in my opinion. Romney presents a better work ethic and overall stronger leadership traits, while Obama is simply a skilled teleprompter reader. If anyone holds a strong political savvy and tenacious work ethic as a figurehead of this election, it would be Paul Ryan, regardless of how radically right-winged he may be.<br /><br />Final note; Paul Ryan is going to obliterate Joe Biden in the upcoming vice-presidential debate. Be sure to tune in if you wish to see some true destruction.

				Yea I&#039;m voting for Gary Johnson. I think Obama will win. Romney is a dirty liar... I don&#039;t like either main party. Money needs to go, and lobbyists need to be illegal. Then maybe we&#039;d see some policy changes state side...

				Romney is probably the worst evil because he&#039;s the devil we don&#039;t know, and because his being elected would destroy whatever (slim) chance we have of a conservative anti-war movement.<br />Obama, the devil we know, and at least as long as he&#039;s in office the Republicans aren&#039;t going to be as gung-ho for war.<br />I consider Johnson the least of the three major evils, but I don&#039;t believe in voting for evil, so... count me out.

				Don&#039;t really give a damn who wears the crown when I don&#039;t even believe in hats. <br />Voting is too much like giving consent to one&#039;s own slavery to me.

				Eh, the independents don&#039;t have the funding to win. So really, they don&#039;t count, even though I agree with them more... <br /><br />Romey&#039;s ideas on social issues are crazy. He&#039;s a bible thumper. I can&#039;t vote for someone who follows that outdated book. I know that politicians have to be christian to appease the masses, but at least Obama doesn&#039;t let a sky wizard run his life.

				I think Gary Johnson is the best candidate. Ignoring his views, he climbed mount everest, created a successful business in New Mexico from scratch, vetoed more bills than the other 49 governors combined (everything he considered wasteful spending), is consistent and dedicated and smoked weed during a recovery from an injury.<br /><br />Almost all Americans don&#039;t like the two party system, but they know only one of those two can win it.<br /><br />Americans who don&#039;t like the two party system, especially not in swing states need to know that every vote counts for Gary Johnson. If he can get 5% of the vote, the Libertarian party will get $9 million federal funding. This will allow the candidate to kick off their campaign immediately and pick up more followers quicker and get more funding from them.<br /><br />This means that in 2016, it will be the first year three parties will be getting federal funding in over a century. I think people will see that the Libertarian party is their third party option and if the candidate is a good one again, their vote percentage will increase, or they may even win if people see that they actually have a chance and decide to vote for the third party.<br /><br />But I think I&#039;m being pretty optimistic.
