				Photo of a Brony:<br /><br />http://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/2013/06/26/bronys_men_who_dig_my_little_pony_feel_misunderstood/inside_blake_and_my_little_pony_collection.jpg.size.xxlarge.promo.jpg<br /><br />I think bronies are a symptom of the infantilization and emasculation of the American male. Frozen out of social mobility and surrounded by a schizophrenic female culture that is composed of either drugged-out whores who rationalize their slutty behaviour in the most ridiculous terms and shrill harpies who never fail to be offended and outraged at any typical male behaviour, these guys, who never had male role models, retreat into a technological simulacra thanks to it being the route of the least resistance.<br /><br />What&#039;s frightening is how much ephobophilia and borderline (and sometimes overt) pedophilia comprises the margins of this virtual universe.<br /><br />It&#039;s a socially destructive form of escapism from the already annihilated social sphere in which this generation of North Americans live. These guys are retreating from the real world because it is fucking ugly out there thanks to the seismic changes in social mores, the inversion of traditional values, and economic stagnation and retreat. In the old days, guys that couldn&#039;t cope would check out by becoming barflies or surrendering to the self-enclosed bubble of heroin.<br /><br />Told that they&#039;re guilty simply by birth of accident for being white males, surrounded by mentally and physically diseases whores and fat harpies who shit on them for acting like typical males, seeing no prospects in their futures in a system that only rewards the most wealthy, they seek solace in a world of make believe, influenced by all the estrogen that poisoned them in their formative years.<br />

				To clarify: The &#039;brony&#039; is a small segment of a larger and growing culture of disaffected young white males who are retreating into online life and detaching themselves from reality. The Japanese have a similar and more pronounced culture called &quot;hikkomori&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=182701.msg1326677#msg1326677">Quote from: helll on July 10, 2013, 10:22 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Why all the slut-shaming joywind?&nbsp; Might it have to do with your own insecurity over a lack of sexual experience?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>No, it&#039;s because sluts deserve to be scorned and shamed for being sluts.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Of course!&nbsp; Since there are only two types of women, those dirty sluts you mentioned earlier and feminazi cunts on the other hand.&nbsp; Spoken like a man who has not talked to many women.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>The trend in American culture, both popular and academic, has been towards these two poles.
