				In the world I see, you&#039;re relaxing in an opiate lounge, using a Dvorak keyboard and Ubuntu&#039;s <br />preinstalled version of Firefox to browse the Internet on your portable Generation 4 Raspberry Pi. <br />The effects of the morphine begin to wear off, and you start to worry about the imminent <br />withdrawal. You walk up to proprietor of the lounge, asking him about the price of Suboxone as <br />you navigate to his address on your portable version of Bitcoin-QT. Meanwhile outside, a delivery <br />of amphetamines to a nearby commons house is made, soon to be a kickstarter for a night of <br />coding for the volunteer residents. When you leave the opium bar, you enjoy the music of a public street concert that you pass while walking to the Bitcoin-farm-heated hammock-camp you call home. and when you finally lay down and look up at the faint stars, you think of all the executives &amp; CEOs, all the ministers &amp; clergymen, and all the senators &amp; presidents that are cowering in fear because of you.<br />

				and then some guy with a gun runs into your opium lounge and steals all your money.&nbsp; you go to the commons house but they have no electricity because their generators ran out of gas and the oil cartels are 10x worse than the mexican drug cartels we currently know so well.&nbsp; &nbsp;and all the volunteer programmers are trying to figure out how to get their septic system running properly since there&#039;s no public sewage.&nbsp; you go to the corner party to let loose a bit, but there&#039;s a bunch of junkies laid out on the street leaving you no room to dance.&nbsp; so you go to a restaurant to get some food and a drink but the food is contaminated with rat feces and you get food poisoning.&nbsp; too bad ur friends still haven&#039;t got the septic system functional, so you have to experience explosive diarrhea in an alley way.&nbsp; but some gang/militia claims that alley as their own and doesn&#039;t take kindly to you shitting there so they kick your ass and sell you into slavery.<br /><br />yay anarchy.

And then they hunt down the thief and recover the stolen money for themselves, and after negotiation with the thieves private defense agency they also fine him heavily, keeping the profit from the fine as well as their yearly subscription fee from the opiate den. The commons house gets electricity from a power grid, which is owned and operated by a private industry. Partially it is also solar powered though, and it used to be powered by gas. The oil cartels attempted to price fix high, but then one of them realized he could charge less than the others and instantly got all of the customers.

At the end the price stayed at about the lowest it could go for the producers to feel like it was worth it for them, and although they made a fortune they didn&#039;t manage to charge more than the price of oil today. The septic system works fine and it is emptied out by a private industry every now and then. You decide to go to a privately owned party house and as you are not a junkie you decide to avoid the junkie friendly establishment. Everyone is high on MDMA and LSD and nobody is worried about the police coming and enslaving everybody, because the house is protected by a private defense agency that protects its clients from slavery. Then you go to a restaurant, but first you check to make sure that they are certified by the private health certification company of your choice. You know that for them to be certified they must meet certain standards and agree to be randomly audited, and the health certification agency you have went with has it in their best interests to be as thorough as possible in their inspections, because they are well respected and make their money by auditing restaurants who pay for a chance at certification, and nobody cares to be certified by an establishment that certifies unsanitary restaurants as the sick customers will throw a fit and the value of being certified by that company will drop and they will go out of business. You don&#039;t get diarrhea from eating at the restaurant, and on your way home you are confident that you will not be stopped and harassed by any gangs or police agencies, because you are just minding your own business and you live in a city that is patrolled by multiple cooperating libertarian defense agencies. Plus you have a big ass gun.
