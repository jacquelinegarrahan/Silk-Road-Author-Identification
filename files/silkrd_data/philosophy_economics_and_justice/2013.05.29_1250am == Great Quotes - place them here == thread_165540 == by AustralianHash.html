				&quot;The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;If I had engaged in politics, I should have perished long ago and done no good to either you or to myself. ...for the truth is that no man who goes to war with you or any other multitude, honestly struggling against the commission of unrighteouosness and wrong in the State, will save his life; he who will really fight for right, if he would live even for a little while, must have a private station and not a public one&quot;<br /><br />Both Socrates.&nbsp; 2500 years ago.

				&quot;All your nonsenses and truths, your finery and squalid options, combine and coalesce to one noise including laugh and whimper, scream and sigh, forever and forever repeating, in any tongue we care to choose, whatever lessened, separated message we want to hear. It all boils down to nothing, and where we have the means and will to fix our reference within that flux; there we are. If it has any final signal, the universe says simply, but with every possible complication, &quot;Existence&quot;, and it neither pressures us, nor draws us out, except as we allow. Let me be part of that outrageous chaos ... and I am.&quot;

				“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.”&nbsp; -- Mark Twain<br /><br />“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.” -- Albert Einstein<br /><br />“Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that.”&nbsp; -- George Carlin<br /><br />“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.”&nbsp; -- Aristotle<br /><br />“May you live every day of your life.”&nbsp; -- Jonathon Swift<br /><br />“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”&nbsp; -- Aristotle<br /><br />“Illegal aliens have always been a problem in the United States. Ask any Indian.”&nbsp; -- Robert Orben<br /><br />“The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. <br />To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. <br />To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.”&nbsp; -- Douglas Adams<br /><br />“I predict future happiness for Americans, if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.”&nbsp; -- Thomas Jefferson<br /><br />“Don&#039;t cry because it&#039;s over, smile because it happened.”&nbsp; -- Dr. Seuss<br /><br />“For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.”&nbsp; -- Ralph Waldo Emerson<br /><br />“Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.” -- Martin Luther King, Jr.<br /><br />“It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.”&nbsp; -- André Gide<br /><br />“If you are bored and disgusted by politics and don&#039;t bother to vote, you are in effect voting for the entrenched Establishments of the two major parties, who please rest assured are not dumb, and who are keenly aware that it is in their interests to keep you disgusted and bored and cynical and to give you every possible reason to stay at home doing one-hitters and watching MTV on primary day. By all means stay home if you want, but don&#039;t bullshit yourself that you&#039;re not voting. In reality, there is no such thing as not voting: you either vote by voting, or you vote by staying home and tacitly doubling the value of some Diehard&#039;s vote.”&nbsp; -- David Foster Wallace<br /><br />“The first duty of a man is to think for himself”&nbsp; -- José Martí<br /><br />“The heaviest penalty for declining to rule is to be ruled by someone inferior to yourself.”&nbsp; -- Plato<br /><br /><br />“The older I grow, the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom.”&nbsp; -- H.L. Mencken<br /><br />“In science it often happens that scientists say, &#039;You know that&#039;s a really good argument; my position is mistaken,&#039; and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn&#039;t happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.”&nbsp; -- Carl Sagan<br /><br />“Half of the American people have never read a newspaper. Half never voted for President. One hopes it is the same half.”&nbsp; -- Gore Vidal<br /><br />“The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.”&nbsp; -- Marcus Aurelius<br /><br />“I think that in human evolution it has never been as necessary to have this substance LSD. It is just a tool to turn us into what we are supposed to be.”&nbsp; -- Albert Hofmann<br /><br />“The best way to cheer yourself is to cheer somebody else up.”&nbsp; -- Albert Einstein

				&quot;I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world, together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that manifests itself in nature.&quot; - Albert Einstein, The World as I See It<br /><br />&quot;There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day, [The Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy] suggests, and try it. The first part is easy. All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it&#039;s going to hurt. That is, it&#039;s going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground. Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it fairly hard.&nbsp; Clearly, it is the second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.&quot; Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker&#039;s Guide to the Galaxy<br /><br />&quot;HAD I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,<br />&nbsp;Enwrought with golden and silver light,<br />&nbsp;The blue and the dim and the dark cloths<br />&nbsp;Of night and light and the half light,<br />&nbsp;I would spread the cloths under your feet:<br />&nbsp;But I, being poor, have only my dreams;<br />&nbsp;I have spread my dreams under your feet;<br />&nbsp;Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.&quot; - W.B. Yates, He Wishes For the Cloths of Heaven<br /><br />&quot;I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving<br />&nbsp; hysterical naked,<br />dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry<br />&nbsp; fix,<br />angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the <br />&nbsp; starry dynamo in the machinery of night,<br />who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the<br />&nbsp; supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of<br />&nbsp; cities contemplating jazz,&quot; - Allen Ginsberg, Howl<br /><br />&quot;It seems hard to sneak a look at God&#039;s cards. But that He plays dice and uses &quot;telepathic&quot; methods... is something that I cannot believe for a single moment.&quot; - Albert Einstein, In a letter to Cornel Lanczos, 21 Mar 1942<br /><br />&quot;When I examine myself and my methods of thought I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Yes, we now have to divide up our time like that, between politics and our equations. But to me our equations are far more important, for politics are only a matter of present concern. A mathematical equation stands forever.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;What I am really interested in is knowing whether God could have created the world in a different way; in other words, whether the requirement of logical simplicity admits a margin of freedom.&quot; - All Albert Einstein.<br /><br />&quot;The hippies, who had never really believed they were the wave of the future anyway, saw the election results as brutal confirmation of the futility of fighting the establishment on its own terms.&quot; - Hunter S. Thompson<br /><br />&quot;Richard Nixon has never been one of my favorite people anyway. For years I&#039;ve regarded his existence as a monument to all the rancid genes and broken chromosomes that corrupt the possibilities of the American Dream; he was a foul caricature of himself, a man with no soul, no inner convictions, with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad. The Nixon I remembered was absolutely humorless; I couldn&#039;t imagine him laughing at anything except maybe a paraplegic who wanted to vote Democratic but couldn&#039;t quite reach the lever on the voting machine.&quot; - Hunter S. Thompson<br /><br />I&#039;ve got a ton more... I also like the one in my signature. I think this is good for now :)

				You see, no one&#039;s going to help you Bubby, because there isn&#039;t anybody out there to do it. No one.<br /><br />&nbsp;We&#039;re all just complicated arrangements of atoms and subatomic particles - we don&#039;t live. But our atoms do move about in such a way as to give us identity and consciousness. <br /><br />We don&#039;t die; our atoms just rearrange themselves. There is no God. <br /><br />There can be no God; it&#039;s ridiculous to think in terms of a superior being. An inferior being, maybe, because we, we who don&#039;t even exist, we arrange our lives with more order and harmony than God ever arranged the earth. <br /><br />We measure; we plot; we create wonderful new things. We are the architects of our own existence. What a lunatic concept to bow down before a God who slaughters millions of innocent children, slowly and agonizingly starves them to death, beats them, tortures them, rejects them.<br /><br />&nbsp;What folly to even think that we should not insult such a God, damn him, think him out of existence. It is our duty to think God out of existence. It is our duty to insult him.<br /><br />&nbsp;Fuck you, God! Strike me down if you dare, you tyrant, you non-existent fraud! It is the duty of all human beings to think God out of existence. Then we have a future. Because then - and only then - do we take full responsibility for who we are. <br /><br />And that&#039;s what you must do, Bubby: think God out of existence; take responsibility for who you are.<br /><br />The Scientist (Bad Boy Bubby)

				<div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: John Maynard Keynes</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but [also] at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth.<br /><br />Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become &quot;profiteers,&quot; who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.<br /><br />Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />It&#039;s great that you can use Bitcoins to buy drugs through the mail -- I certainly don&#039;t want to downplay the importance of that.&nbsp; But they also represent the possibility of something much larger.

				&quot;A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we&#039;d get into that rotten stuff pretty soon. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;One of the things you learn from years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug. Especially when it&#039;s waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye. &quot;<br /><br />Im sure everybody knows where these are from&nbsp; ;D
