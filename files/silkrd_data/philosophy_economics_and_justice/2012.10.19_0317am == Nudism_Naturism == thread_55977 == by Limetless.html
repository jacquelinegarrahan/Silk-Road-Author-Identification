				Absolutely, I think it&#039;s very important for your personal well being, to feel free within yourself when nude, if your not going to be comfortable within your own skin, who else is going to be?&nbsp; We&#039;re all born into this world naked, so we should all be fine with it and let go of our mental blocks, of course at the right place and the right time. ;)

				I think nudism/naturism is really cool and very liberating. I have had one experience of public nudism and, I must say, it was probably the coolest experience of my life. Not to mention being the most liberating experience. I was at a festival in the UK and there was a photographer called Spencer Tunick doing an installation at the festival. Spencer Tunick goes around to different places and gets people to pose naked in different positions etc and he photographs it. Check out some of his stuff on google, it is fairly cool.<br /><br />Anyway, he was doing this at the festival. So, at 7am on the Sunday morning of the festival, myself and about 750 other people got naked, all in the name of art. It was an amazing experience and all self inhibitions were gone within minutes...even if I had a pilly willy after a heavy night of booze and drugs the night before. :)

				All one has to do is look at the low rates of divorce and infidelity among nudists to know that it&#039;s a good idea, although that may be counterintuitive to those who equate nudity with lust.<br /><br />Though purely as a matter of personal preference I don&#039;t like being naked. I really don&#039;t like the way I look naked and I can&#039;t imagine that anyone else wants to see me in with all my flab and wedding tackle on display.

				Im not a nudist but I love being naked. To me; its a personal thing, not a societal battle. Some nudists seem to think that by attacking the public with their preferences; change will be facilitated, i disagree.<br /><br />to me nudism is a much more personal, spiritual thing. when im naked i feel much more in touch with myself and my surroundings; i think i&#039;d lose some of that magic putting myself &#039;Out-there,&#039; in nudist colonies or randomly when camping (as you do ofter see,) its for me, the universe, my lover and a few other close people.
