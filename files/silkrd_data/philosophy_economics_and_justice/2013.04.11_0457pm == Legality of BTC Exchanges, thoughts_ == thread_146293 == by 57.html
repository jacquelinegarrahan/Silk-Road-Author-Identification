				Disclaimer: I have no legal background or fact based evidence, I&#039;m just interested in hearing peoples opinions<br /><br /><br />So, I was reading an article in Wired magazine a few weeks ago about the car stereo installer who was installing traps inside peoples vehicles to hide their valuables.&nbsp; Secret compartments where you could stash your wallet or other items so they would not get stolen if someone broke into your vehicle.&nbsp; Of course the people who had these traps installed began using them to traffic large amounts of cash, drugs and weapons.&nbsp; One day the installer had to help a customer open a trap that was jammed and a load full of cash fell out of it.&nbsp; Long story short, the installer was sentenced to a long prison sentence with a drug trafficking charge.&nbsp; The judge told him since he saw a large amount of cash he must have deduced that his traps were being used for illegal purposes and should have called the police.&nbsp; <br /><br />Based on my interpretation of this article, and the concept that since the guy saw the cash he was guilty of trafficking, wouldn&#039;t BTC exchanges, who know that BTC/USD exchanges are being used to traffic narcotics and launder money, be guilty of these charges? <br /><br />I&#039;m interested in your thoughts and opinions.&nbsp; &nbsp;
