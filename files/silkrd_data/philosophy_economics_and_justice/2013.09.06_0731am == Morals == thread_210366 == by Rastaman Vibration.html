				I&#039;ve been having an internal debate with myself about some moral issues related to the SR game lately. Hoping to get some opinions.<br /><br />Without getting too specific, sometimes the cost of your anonimity involves being deliberately deceptive to others, and sometimes putting others unwittingly at risk. Sometimes I want my drugs no matter what the cost. Its not me, its the system. I&#039;m just gaming the system to get what I want. Which I shouldnt&#039; even be denied in the first place. Other times, I feel like the cost of my drugs shouldnt involve deceiving others and its going to slap the proverbial bad karma on whatever drug I obtain by &quot;socially engineering&quot; another person.<br /><br />Anyone else clog their brain with such moral dilemmas? Any good coping strategies?<br /><br />Thanks<br />Jah bless

I will pose a coupla questions for you to ask yourself, and then, should you see fit to post your responses, I would be obliged, and grateful for the insight into another&#039;s process. <br /><br />1. are you familiar with the phrase, &quot;the end justifies the means?&quot;&#039;<br /><br />2. how do you think that query applies to you in this quandary, or does it?<br /><br />3. are you prepared for the consequences should your deception be found out by those you care for?<br /><br />4. you used &quot;should&quot; twice in your query, how attached to your &quot;shoulds&quot; are you? <br /><br />Now, my response. I never do or say anything unless I am prepared to accept the consequences. Not taking an action is just as significant in some cases, and when I have chosen not to take an action, I accept those consequences as well. If I am going to cause harm to someone, I do it with deliberate and malicious intent to cause them the most harm in the shortest amount of time possible. If I am going to be an idle observer, I do that with intent as well. <br /><br />It boils down to this, for me. I cannot control the actions and responses of others. I surrender to their autonomy, their inalienable right to not agree with me, or to do the things I do. I accept the consequences of all that I do, and all that I don&#039;t do. If I cause harm to one I did not wish to harm, I will take ownership of it, not blame them for having a reaction to me being a shite. <br /><br /><br />

				@turdburglarSandwich, thanks for your reply. To answer your questions,<br /><br />1&amp;2 - Yes this is precisely my dilemma. At times I can convince myself than the end (getting my drugs) justify\ies the means (being deceptive to others). But other times, I realize its just drugs, and my desire to get high does not justify deceiving others and potentially putting them at risk. A moral quandry indeed.<br /><br />3. The people I&#039;m deceiving/potenially putting at risk are not people I am close to or care for. Its not so much the consequences of being found out that bother me, its more my own conscience, so to speak. <br /><br />4. I think its completely wrong and immoral for the prohibitionist state to make drugs &quot;illegal&quot; and restrict my access to them in the first place. In a perfect world, I *should* just be able to go buy what I want, when I please. But the world we live in is most certainly not perfect. And again, does the fact that the system is unjust have any bearing on the way I chose to treat others?<br /><br />I fully realize that I am choosing to occupy myself with such moral dilemmas. At any point, I could just pick a side, and not look back. But instead, I choose to be indecisive and philosophical. Just curious as to how others deal with it ;D

				Hi Rastaman!<br /><br />An interesting and thoughtful post.&nbsp; I think the most important thing to note here is that you are not trying to put others at risk.&nbsp; On the contrary, you are going to extraodinary lengths to maintain your anonymity and to protect others, while pursuing your desires.&nbsp; It is this intention that is the thing to focus on.<br /><br />I believe since your intention is to not do harm, but be true to your life desires, you are on solid moral ground.<br /><br />Ponder the opposite situation, imagine that you were the person whom was deceived by another so that they could pursue their desires and joys, also consider that it was never that person&#039;s intention to do you harm...but then through an accident you were in fact harmed.&nbsp; Could you forgive them?&nbsp; I think in time a decent person could.<br /><br />Guilt is a terrible thing, and it can eat you up inside if you let it, so don&#039;t let it.&nbsp; Be kind to those in your world.&nbsp; Do as little harm as you can and pursue your joy.&nbsp; <br /><br />In other words...smoke &#039;em if you got &#039;em.&nbsp; :-)<br /><br />R.<br />
