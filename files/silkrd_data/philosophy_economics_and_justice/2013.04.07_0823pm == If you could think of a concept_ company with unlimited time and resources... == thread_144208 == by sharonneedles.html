				If you could think of a concept/ company with unlimited time and resources, what would it be? <br /><br />As a thought experiment I&#039;m thinking of current world issues such as starvation, country debt, etc. and trying to come up with ideas to solve them. They don&#039;t have to be practical solutions, could be purely theoretical. Although ending the country debt issue above could be solved using BTC which would have a practical element too :)<br /><br />Ideas welcome here,<br />Peace

				I would found a company that seeks to analyze society itself and weed out / fix inefficiencies of ignorance or misinformation. It would thus seek to bring larger portions of the population to enlightenment, because this is what has frustrated me in making societal progress:<br />&nbsp;No matter what social programs, fixes, and steps we take, if some 60% of society is ignorant, and raises their kids ignorant, then all of our problem remain. We need to reduce the proportion of the population that is ignorant, and then a better society will follow.<br /><br />Unlimited time and resources would allow for a shadowy global organization removing from power those who knowingly perpetuate harm for their own good, and hijacking media that&#039;s spouting propaganda or outright lies. Finally remove the absurdity that is creationism from textbooks, remove anyone who has cited a religious reason in their administration of power over other people, just clean up the parts of the world that would make any sane, thinking individual hold his head and go, &quot;dammit, why?&quot;<br /><br />You may ask, &quot;how is this better than just taking over the world and establishing your own dictatorship?&quot;<br /><br />We&#039;d have one tenant: critical thought. No organization that seeks to mislead teaches critical thought. The US GOP? Fiercely opposes any measure that seeks to introduce higher-order thinking skills such as critical evaluation, because it relies on an ignorant support base. An aware people would be able to organize and lead themselves justly, and my organization would become unneeded after completing its task.

				It&#039;s idealist, and I&#039;m not saying the US Dems would be in power once my shadow gov&#039;t had run its course :)<br /><br />I was just handpicking examples of ignorance in the modern world that hurt large portions of the population.<br />Vote? Maybe. I think in many matters, expert decisions should count more than who has more people clamoring for one thing or another.<br /><br />And I&#039;m not *saying* starve the ignorant ukrainians, I&#039;m saying remove the systems that are exploiting them / perpetuating that ignorance. As for stalin&#039;s free elections, again, he had no intent of following through, as he was maneuvering for power, and relies on subjugate-able populace. One with full, private communications within itself would be far harder to control.<br /><br />OP asked the question, I answered. &quot;make the world smarter, fix its problems&quot;

				It already exists, just like the endless-motion machine.<br /><br />Literacy and the human mind. It&#039;s an enterprise that has existed in excess of 7,000 years. It&#039;s still going strong. If you dedicate yourself to education and health, then you will realize how this enterprise is not only in play, but thriving.<br /><br />WikiLeaks has broken the control over information, and hackers and hacktivists have made things like Liberte and knowledge free--open source. Silk Road has gone public... globally public. Those with basic education can get here. It&#039;s where you go from here that determines if you&#039;ll live forever: your legacy.<br /><br />Remember: Al Capone was a big bad, rich gangster. He also died from syphilis while living in a cage. The more love you share, and the closer to Right you are than to Wrong, the better everything will be--for everyone.

				Literacy and the human mind alone aren&#039;t enough - we&#039;ve seen that ignorance will perpetuate itself just as well, often more aggressively.<br /><br />We need to take steps to make sure literacy and the human mind are able to thrive - that those who would prevent its growth are unable to.<br /><br />Fusion: The eggheads havn&#039;t gotten it quite down yet.

				I say eggheads because though I avidly study the sciences, I don&#039;t know a fraction of what they do, and so won&#039;t claim to understand WHY what their doing doesn&#039;t work yet. Maybe it was a poor choice of word because it comes across as derogatory.<br /><br />I&#039;m not saying, &quot;can&#039;t be done, leave it be,&quot; I&#039;m saying, &quot;I&#039;m not part of the team figuring it out, so I leave their work to them until I know enough to contribute&quot;<br />&nbsp;unlike the many forums full of people discussing hyper-unity engines and other thermodynamically impossible ideas as if it was just a matter of knowing the right science.<br />

				As I&#039;ve said elsewhere on this forum, every forum is the same. It&#039;s contains a few very smart, very frequent contributors, and inundated by lazy contributors. We all know how to do drugs--they all know the laws of thermodynamics and some interesting maths--but in the end, there are only a few people that manage NOT to fuck up all the time.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like any one group getting a special label. In implies they are beyond error-checking by people like you and me. No one is above error-checking. If a computer program doesn&#039;t work, then it is either debugged or deleted. Human affairs should be no different. Our prisons are full of dangerous and violent people, but instead of seeing the problem as a safety and necessity, we could look at ourselves and see that it is a management problem. Society has not chosen to manage the mentally ill, so instead, a system not much different than slavery continues. People aren&#039;t willing to blame themselves and take responsibility for error-checking. Same with US Congress. Economics. Law.<br /><br />Marijuana isn&#039;t legal because the majority that consume the sweet grass are either too lazy or too stoned. Drugs will remain such until you take responsibility and undertake the endeavor of error-checking society. It&#039;s an engineering problem. It falls under the same categories of thermodynamics as everything else.

You can&#039;t define God in scientific terms because faith isn&#039;t observable. To quote Thomas Szasz loosely, holy water isn&#039;t considered holy because of science. You can&#039;t simply test the water for a special compound. It becomes religious when it&#039;s blessed by a priest and the belief is adopted by the church go-ers. <br /><br />In general I&#039;m against secularist societies. I think the question of God can&#039;t be proven true or false. So a policy to ban certain religions does delve into totalitarianism, for me. [/quote]

All that would happen is that individuals and organizations that don&#039;t deploy critical thought in their assessments now would just come up with rationalizations to justify their ignorant beliefs. So where do you draw the line? Empiricism?<br /><br />I&#039;ll just point out that the scientific consensus is not always right. It&#039;s sometimes based on limited or incomplete information and the consensus changes based on scientific advances. I&#039;ll just take the crude example of the secular argument against homosexuality a few hundred years ago and utilized until fairly recently. Obviously individuals engaging in homosexual practices (or I guess known simply as sodomy and sodomites back then) couldn&#039;t be outlawed based on religious principles in secular societies. But the secular argument against homosexuality using scientific rationalizations from Darwinism that the purpose of all life was to reproduce was that homosexuality was unnatural because it served no procreative value. This was the scientific argument used in secular society not just by secularists but also adopted by religious conservatives to push their agenda. Science has since discovered that homosexual behavior has been observed in all species across the animal kingdom, with some species having significantly higher rates than others. These discoveries are what was cited by the US Supreme Court in finally striking down many state sodomy laws and only happened as recently as 2003. <br /><br />Empiricism doesn&#039;t always resolve the issue at hand and relying on empiricism can lead down slippery slopes. Look at the whole discredited eugenics movement.<br /><br />So do you outlaw &quot;faith&quot;? That becomes a pretty difficult thing to define in practice. Where do you draw the line to where there&#039;s enough empirical support for something that it crosses over from faith to empiricism? And how do you outlaw something when some of the greatest ideas begin as kernels of faith? Atoms weren&#039;t directly observable until the atomic force microscope was developed in the early eighties, yet the entire fields of modern physics and chemistry assumed their existence. In fact the creation of the atomic bomb functioned on the presupposition of atomic properties. But lets travel back to when the existence of atoms was no more than an unsupportable idea of Democritus that was ridiculed and dismissed by Aristotle. Or how about when the idea of the DNA double helix came to scientist John Watson in a dream which at that point was unsupportable. Can you really advocate a society where unsupportable ideas are outlawed? <br /><br />I would hope not.<br /><br />So how can you fairly and legitimately distinguish between scientific and religious thought when it comes to articles of faith?

The US really lags in this regard. Its always better to have individuals choose to engage in critical thought on their own than trying to coerce it. Just reveal the choice to engage in critical thinking so obvious and the alternative so repellant that it would be a total conscious decision to embrace stupidity. The magical thinking that comes with religious zealotry will go the way of the Luddites and they&#039;ll reduce themselves to obsolete inbred communities like the Amish or fundamentalist Mormons whose days are numbered by their lack of genetic diversity.<br />It really just starts with education.<br /><br />Now, with unlimited time and resources you could turn the &quot;theory&quot; of evolution into the &quot;law of evolution&quot;. Creationists love to point out that evolution on a macro timescale of millions of years is not observable or conclusive as there are too many gaps yet to be filled in. With unlimited time you could decimate that bullshit once and for all. :)
