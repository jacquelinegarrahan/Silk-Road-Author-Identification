				Title: <strong>search warrants</strong><br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				I was recently arrested for possession of class b and class c. During the intake process at the station, people were messaging me for weed to buy. The officers saw this and tagged me as a dealer, and immediately tried adding &quot;intent to distribute&quot; on top of the possession charges. They were unable to do so.<br /><br />Later that night, the detectives told me that they&#039;ll most likely gunna successfully get a search warrant. The next day at court, my appointed lawyer told me they&#039;ll most likely get that, even if he tries to fight it off. Moments later, some DA worker approached my lawyer and I and offered a drug diversion program. I opted for it so that my charges can get dropped after my &quot;treatment&quot;.<br /><br />It&#039;s been about five days since the arrest... do you think they can still get that search warrant?

				Ummm YES.<br /><br /><br />Why are you so worried, clean the hell out of your house. You have over 1000 post, you should know this. Also, why don&#039;t you have burner phones, and why did they have your phone.

				There&#039;s only one reason to tell you they&#039;re going to get a search warrant and then let you go: they don&#039;t think they can get one or don&#039;t intend to and they want to laugh themselves silly as you panic and hide, maybe toss, all your stock.<br /><br />THAT BEING SAID, don&#039;t be foolish, on the off chance they do follow through. People don&#039;t get second chances at avoiding (successful) raids everyday.

I knew they were throwing that around the room so that I&#039;d be more tempted to cooperate with them, which is why I said that I wouldn&#039;t have anything in my house if they got a search warrant.<br /><br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I wasn&#039;t asking so that I could continue business. I was asking because I live with family and would like to know the chances of LE coming thru with it. My fam is already aware of what is going on, just felt like some extra advice from SR couldn&#039;t hurt.

				Stay LOW KEY!<br />Cops say shit like that because they think you will talk.&nbsp; They are building a case.<br />As far as a warrant...<br />&nbsp;what the fuck is a warrant?<br />&nbsp;Do they still even make those?<br />Warrants are just for glam. look at the Boston bombing, people cheered themselves<br />on being searched without a warrant<br /><br />Be carefull, I don&#039;t think they have anything much on you and if this is your first felony charge, you&#039;ll be fine.<br /><br />Much love,<br />you got prayers here fo sho man.<br /><br /><br />

				Cops are just humans and not very clever sometimes. <br />A friend of mine has a huge doberman at his home. One day LE came (probably for a search) and the dog went mad as they approached the door. They left immediatly. My friend saw this and cleaned the house. 3 days later they came back with a K9 handler and of course found nothing 8)

				OP you reported your own post twice, if you want it changed go and edit it yourself. Personally I&#039;m not sure what you were thinking posting it in the first place.
