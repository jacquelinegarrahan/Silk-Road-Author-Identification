				aka.. the right to bear arms.<br /><br />despite the dry title i really just wanted to cut through the waters, muddied or otherwise, as to the fallacy of reasons given both for and against arms ownership in the US being bandied about today. some of these are:<br /><br />hunting<br />home protection<br />militia (invading armies and such)<br />fun<br />and so on and so forth..<br /><br />ignore anyone attempting these arguments, they miss the dimension of the conversation, let alone the planet or anything they may have been aiming at on it (like the US possibly).<br /><br />we have this right because we govern this country and have the ultimate and final say and it is to ensure that we can enforce this governance with absolution.<br /><br />including being able to do drugs when the overwhelming majority of us have already decided that we do not condone actions taken by a rogue few. we have chosen our arms wisely and our master at arms performs with unimpeachable honor to that duty.<br /><br />if you can afford a fucking fighter jet and all that goes with it, you may own it.<br /><br />h

				&nbsp;Yup, the second amendment is important to me for the fact that its the symbol of our freedom. (Which is in grate need of adjustment). That and everyone seems to think that taking away guns will work to stop gun violence in this country like in the UK. We have Mexico on out boarder, we have larger groups of pour Ethnic individuals such as in New York, Brooklyn, a lot of Cali, etc. If guns are taken away it only makes it harder for the good guys to get them, then gun manufacturers will raise prices for our legendary military forces, and Mexico will gladly fill the bad guys orders for firearms. So taking away guns in our condition will do nothing but hurt the people who love this great nation the most.
