				I recently cancelled cable and do not watch any programmed television. It&#039;s all propaganda anyway, and Dad was right, it&#039;ll rot your brain out. Now, my tv only turns on when I what to watch a documentary on Youtube and Netfix (free account from SR) via Apple TV (coupon via PL). Here&#039;s a short list of some of my favorites to date:<br /><br />Zeitgeist (all three)<br /><br />Food Inc<br /><br />Genetic Roulette<br /><br />Esoteric Agenda<br /><br />and I&#039;m just starting Trom2.0 on Youtube, it&#039;s 13 hours and 42 minutes long. Anyone with some other good titles?<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Sup 420blindman P)<br /><br />So my favorite documentry.....well actually can I add a &quot;mockumentry&quot; to our list? My favorite is a Canadian mockumentry &quot;The Trailer Park Boys.&quot; The best show of all time and you can view episodes for free on youtube. Its best to watch from Season 1 then go on in numerical order.

				National geographic has some interesting documentaries on netflix, they cover everything from prison, wildlife, cultures, ect. I have yet to put on a NatGeo docu and not enjoy it and learn from it. I would recommend watching &quot;lockup&quot;. Its what were all facing on here if we ever get caught, lol, so we might as well have some knowledge before hand. We love US netflix. for any Canadian on here who wants to know how to get the US feed just send us a msg and we&#039;ll explain how we do it, but it only works on computers, not game consoles.<br /><br />-Magic

				Cocaine Cowboys is a great one!<br /><br />Its about the cocaine game in the 80&#039;s in Miami. Interesting stuff, Jon Roberts talks a little bit about how his group imported and sold coke.They discuss some of the violence and leaders of the era like Griselda Blanco.<br /><br />Great one to watch especially if your into the white&nbsp; ;)

				For the most part I watch a documentary daily or YouTube of any subject I find interesting that day or week. <br /><br />One has to be very careful in some instances, specifically politically or socially motivating Docs. There are people who are paid to create and perpetuate the public opinion - The term was changed to Public Relations by Edward Bernays because the word Propaganda is a little unsettling now a days. <br /><br />Two questions always:<br />1. Who paid for it (Koch brothers are notorious)<br />2. Who or what will benefit by changing your perspective in line with the Doc message<br /><br />I prefer Historical / Cultural / Biography sections. I like to pick an area or time period that I don&#039;t know much about (e.x. Pre-Revolution Russia, Ottoman Empire, 1860-1900, Colonization of Africa, Early Canada, Balkans) and compile videos for that week. <br /><br />Trolling Grounds:<br />TopDocumentaryFilms.com<br />DocumentaryHeaven.com<br />YouTube.com<br />Vice.com<br />Netflix<br /><br />Some of the really great recent ones I&#039;ve watched:<br />1932: A True American History<br />Ken Burns: Civil War<br />We: Arundhati Roy<br />Secrets of Body Language<br />Why We Fight<br /><br /><br /><br />

				Hi guys, just thought I would register so I could thank the people who suggested exit through the gift shop and the truth about Gaddafi, both excellent docos.<br /><br />One of my fave docos is called You&#039;re Gonna Miss Me, which is based on the life of psychedelic rock pioneer Roky Erickson. Although I&#039;m obviously a big fan of Roky, this doco is quality and great for anyone regardless of what you think of his music, Roky has led an interesting life to say the least.<br /><br />From wiki: <br />You&#039;re Gonna Miss Me is an American documentary film by Keven McAlester. It focuses on Roky Erickson, the former frontman for the band The 13th Floor Elevators. The band is cited as pioneers of the psychedelic rock sound. The film covers Erickson&#039;s rise to rock-and-roll icon status, his overuse of LSD, struggles with schizophrenia, and his 1969 marijuana arrest that led to stays at Austin State Hospital and Rusk State Hospital for the Criminally Insane.<br /><br />I can&#039;t find a free link atm but I&#039;m sure it has to be somewhere on the net.

				Hi there folks. My 1st post on an SR forum. This whole SR thing is fuckin ace &amp; I just wished I&#039;d come across it sooner.<br /><br />-Making a Killing: The Untold Story of Psychotropic Drugging....excellently portrays the power the pharmaceutical industry has to fuck with our heads!<br />-The Problem with Atheism.....I personally am intrigued by the recent wave of interest in atheism, and despite the irritating presenter, I thought this program raised some good points. <br /><br />What does anyone else think?
