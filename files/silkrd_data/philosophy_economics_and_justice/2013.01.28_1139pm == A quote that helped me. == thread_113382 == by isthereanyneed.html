				<br />Below is a quote from the late great Steve Jobs. If you read it till it makes perfect sense in your mind then never forget it maybe put it as a sticky note on your computer or phone and when ever your feeling low for which ever reason that may be or when ever your feeling that you cant do something in life all I ask you to is to simply read the quote below that you got from a guy off the Silk Road forums one day when you were bored and I promise you with all my heart it will change your mind set from negative to positive almost instantly it is literally the post powerful thing I have ever read. Steve Jobs wrote this when he was dieing he was an inspiration to many, RIP Steve Jobs and if this quote helps just one person then I will be happy very happy indeed, thanks for reading........................................<br /><br /><br />“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life”<br /><br />“Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.<br /><br />You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.”<br /><br />

				A few days ago I got robbed, then totaled my car while trying to get away. Obviously, this has been on my mind nonstop since the incident. The middle quote kind of helped me though. Yeah shit sucks but everything I have including my life is only temporary anyway. I don&#039;t mean that to sound depressing but its true. To me its about getting over it. Thank you.
