				Yesterday, twenty 5-10 year olds and several adults were shot dead while at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The shooter killed himself at the scene. Three firearms were found, each were registered to his mother who may have worked at the school. Connecticut has stringent gun laws compared to many other US states.<br /><br />I think every member of this forum would want to extend their sympathies and condolences for anyone affected by this tragedy.<br /><br />President Obama is now calling for &quot;meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this. Regardless of the politics.&quot;<br />What do you think Obama means by this?<br />Do you think there will be a strengthened effort to further restrict the American right to bear arms, now that Obama doesn&#039;t have any further elections to worry about?

				It&#039;s a terrible tragedy. And I hope the American people will realize the futility of government &quot;control&quot; of anything, weapons or otherwise. I hope they also notice that these massacres happen mostly in &quot;gun-free&quot; zones. A form of gun control that leads to buildings full of defenseless and innocent people, and allows massacres of this scale to happen. Allow teachers to carry firearms at work, along with administrators, and these school shootings will cease to claim so many lives.

				I can see the argument from both sides. As i live in Europe i do not have the rights to bear arms as a citizen. <br /><br />There is logic in assuming that if any of the teachers in that school carried a firearm, that teacher may have prevented a significant number of deaths by shooting the assailant before he could proceed to inflict more deaths. <br /><br />Living in an place with stringent gun control, i would consider the reasoning that &quot;if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns&quot; to be perfectly valid. <br /><br />A prime example here is that gun control doesn&#039;t actually work that well. We had a shootout in a shopping mall here resulting in the death of tens of people. The perpetrator in that case did have a weapons license, but not one that allows possession of semi-automatic weapons. I don&#039;t think the latter makes the difference though, someone on a killing spree could proceed even if he had to squeeze the trigger for every round fired. Perhaps that would even make things worse since that would force such a person to take aim between every shot, resulting in more accuracy.

				Seems like trying to stop a suicide bomber - there&#039;s little you could do in a remotely free &amp; open society. This Conneticut kid got his Mom&#039;s guns (I had heard they were also locked, but I am not certain of that) that she owned legally &amp; took them to school to kill a bunch of children. At this point it must become, in the perpretrator&#039;s mind, a suicide anyway, and you couldn&#039;t stop him at this point.

If someone wants to mass murder a bunch of people be that a school full of children of an office block full of adults they&#039;re going to do it one way or another. If they can&#039;t have a gun they will build a bomb. <br />What needs to be done is the American media portraying the killers as some sort of infamous characters that other fucked up psychopaths can look up to and admire, if one kills 30 and becomes infamous for doing so why wont the next one want to go better and kill 60?<br />They should be anonymous and have no place in history.

				Spot-on! I read yesterday where some gun-nut was yelling&nbsp; &amp; screamin at one of the Conneticut victims&#039; parents. I believe in freedom of speech, even yelling at a victim, but what America has lost is common courtesy. What happened to &quot;love your neighbor as you love yourself&quot;?<br /><br />&nbsp;:&#039;(

Usually the media doesn&#039;t make it clear and contributes to the ignorance and mis-information.<br /><br />Fully automatic weapons, where multiple shots are fired with a single pull of the trigger, are already banned in the US. The media and politicians keep calling for bans of &quot;military style semi-auto&quot; weapons, which is a contradiction. They are doing everything they can to confuse people and convince them to ban semi-auto weapons while thinking that full-auto weapons are what is being discussed.

				More political posturing by an administration playing ball with the elite.&nbsp; The one sidedness of the gun issue in the media is a major red flag.&nbsp; They&#039;re not truly giving information but indoctrination.&nbsp; Once people see thru the facade its easy to see what they&#039;re up to.&nbsp; Terrible thing a mentally unstable guy got ahold of a relatives guns and went berserk.&nbsp; But what that has to do with people having guns that won&#039;t ever do that? Nothing.&nbsp; Media wants to paint all people that are in favor of having guns as potentially violent or whatever, anything to discredit so the populace will dismiss anything said in favor of guns.&nbsp; Get guns and hide them like you would a stash of dope.

This fellow, Stefan Molyneaux (I may have mis-spelled his name) has a channel that is like a philosophy talk-show.

				I&#039;d believe it was a hoax if Obama completely took away the right to own guns. When will the government learn that re-writing legislation in direct response to an act of terrorism (such as the the patriot &amp; 9/11) simply lets the terrorists win. It almost turns those legislators into the real terrorists by dehumanizing all citizens vs just cold-blooded murder.
