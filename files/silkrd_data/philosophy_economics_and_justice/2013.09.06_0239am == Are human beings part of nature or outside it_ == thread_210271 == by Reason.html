				Hi!<br /><br />This is an interesting question I&#039;ve kicked around with a few people, especially so called environmentalists.&nbsp; Now don&#039;t get me wrong, I generally like environmentalists, they&#039;re usually nice folks with an earthy-crunch quality and often have good weed.<br /><br />However I&#039;ve had a few occasions where those nice folks have gotten a bit tense when someone starts talking about eating meat, or taking a cruise, or getting a new race car.&nbsp; &quot;You&#039;re killing the planet!&quot;&nbsp; They cry!&nbsp; &quot;We have to save the planet!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Well...on this topic I&#039;m with George Carlin, in that I&#039;m pretty sure the planet is going to be around long after we&#039;re (humanity) is gone.&nbsp; Life (along with the planet) I&#039;m quite confident will carry on.&nbsp; Even if we lit off every nuke in the world, I&#039;d be totally blown away if life ceased to exist.&nbsp; Not a chance IMO.&nbsp; In that situation it basically meant that a natural life form (us) introduced extrodinary environmental changes that the rest of the life forms either had to adapt to or die (including us).<br /><br />The environmentalists almost seem to suggest that we are somehow above nature,&nbsp; outside of it, and somehow it&#039;s our responsibility to care for it.&nbsp; I dunno about that.&nbsp; Save the whales?&nbsp; Fuck the whales...save the people (if necessary by eating them..the whales that is..not the people).&nbsp; A lot of these folks point to the last few polar bears floating away to sea on a piece of ice that melted and broke off because of global warming and say &quot;See...that&#039;s our fault, those animals are going to go extinct because of us!&quot;, whereas I then point to pigeons and dogs and say &quot;see those animals are totally thriving because of us!&quot;.<br /><br />What do environmentalists have agains dogs anyway!?&nbsp; <br /><br />If humanity makes things happen to the environment...isn&#039;t that &quot;natural&quot;?&nbsp; Aren&#039;t we part of nature too!?<br /><br />BTW:&nbsp; Totally playing devils advocate here...as always I continue to ponder the idea...and look forward to your contributions to the discussion.<br /><br />PS. I like polar bears (unless they&#039;re trying to kill me) and would never eat whale (way too fatty).<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />R. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m a Carlinist too.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ve always thought the &quot;Save The Planet&quot; rallying cry was stupid.&nbsp; Save?&nbsp; Save what?&nbsp; The Planet?&nbsp; The planet doesn&#039;t give a flying fuck about us or what we&#039;re doing scurrying about on its microscopically thin layer of decaying matter, fungus and bacteria that we call &quot;Nature&quot;.&nbsp; We don&#039;t get any more attention outside of the Planet either.&nbsp; Our Solar System, Galactic Arm, Galaxy, Cluster, Super Cluster, Universe, Multiverse, could fucking care less too!<br /><br />Earth was here long before we came along and will be here long after we&#039;re gone.&nbsp; It doesn&#039;t need us to save it, but we need it to save us.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The cry should be &quot;Save Us&quot;. And if that means destroying the planet to do it, then fucking bombs away!<br /><br />ps.&nbsp; No, I don&#039;t want to die.&nbsp; Yes, I like nature.<br />

				On the other hand, that doesn&#039;t mean we get to be pricks.&nbsp; &nbsp;Driving polar bears to extinction sucks and if changing my habits a little bit could prevent that, I&#039;m in.<br /><br />My point is the hypocrisy of the statement &quot;Save the Planet&quot;.&nbsp; I have shit loads of empathy for all of nature.&nbsp; I don&#039;t even kill bugs if I can avoid it.

				Humans are very much part of nature. Its similar to the way a parasite is part of nature. Or the way mold grows on a peach. It&#039;ll cover the entire peach and suck the life out of it. That&#039;s what we&#039;re doing to our planet. But its perfectly natural... and unfortunate...

				I&#039;ve heard people refer to humanity as a virus, so the parasite idea seems pretty close to that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think that of course we are part of nature, though many humans think we&#039;re above it.&nbsp; I don&#039;t agree with the idea that we should save ourselves at the expense of other creatures necessarily, especially when we created the problems in the first place.&nbsp; They really had no way to counteract us, just like most humans can&#039;t really counteract what is essentially a small group of actors speaking for all of the planet.&nbsp; <br /><br />When I hear people talking about animals like they have no ability to think or feel, I think that they&#039;re just egotistical and narrow-minded.&nbsp; The same goes for when people think that humans are inherently better than any group of animals and deserve more than them.&nbsp; Hell, they haven&#039;t done anything wrong, and they&#039;ve been wronged, I think they deserve far more leeway than we do.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are some countries that are giving civil rights to animals and plant life, which I think is really an amazing concept considering where the thinking is in the rest of the world.&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it&#039;s going to save most species that are dying out, and the Anthropocene (what many scientists are calling this era of human created ecological activity on a worldwide scale, basically replacing the Holocene since the Industrial Revolution period) is dangerously close to changing the face of the planet and its living makeup in the largest way that any lifeforms have done since, well, since O2 entered the atmosphere, perhaps.&nbsp; <br /><br />I get that people want to save themselves over other creatures, though, *if* it comes down to that, but what irks me is that it doesn&#039;t have to come down to that and yet it will likely do so.&nbsp; But this is another stage in our emotional evolution and maturity, I keep telling myself, because it&#039;s a good way to stay sane about the affair.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personally I slow down or swerve for little fuzzy animals, but I kill the fuck out of spiders, roaches, and crane flies if they don&#039;t stay away from me.&nbsp; So call me a hypocrite, call me a human.&nbsp; But yeah, the planet will live on, and eventually it will regenerate the mountains, and clean the streams and air.&nbsp; The plastic and other land litter we leave behind, well.&nbsp; Who knows what that will become down the line.&nbsp; The earth could very well become icy cold and then burning hot and it could break down into its components again, or it could remain a dirty wasteland free from all living creatures.&nbsp; There&#039;s also the possibility that whichever species of plant and animal survive the human-made atrocity this earth is potentially becoming (what with pollution AND chemical interference) might evolve and evolve and evolve and while we lose individual creatures and individual species, we will regain the planet in new, ever-changing designs as different species take the stage for their time as masters of the planet.<br /><br /><br />This was fun to think about so thanks for the thread.<br />

				Thanks everyone for chiming in!&nbsp; I guess the consensus of Silk Roaders is that...yep we&#039;re all natural!&nbsp; I don&#039;t suppose I should be surprised at this, I&#039;ve found my fellow SR travelers to be a very rational lot.<br /><br />I guess the one thing that I&#039;ve felt a vibe about in this thread that I&#039;m not in agreement with is a common theme about how bad humanity is (we&#039;re like a virus, or that we&#039;ll kill ourselves off and the plantet will get better...that kind of thing).&nbsp; I am soundly pro-human.&nbsp; I love humans!&nbsp; <br /><br />Why?&nbsp; Well we are just really awesome critters.&nbsp; We build spaceships and video games, we are just super smart.&nbsp; We fuck not just for procreation but also for the sheer joy of it, we&#039;re super sexy.&nbsp; We&#039;re hugely social, and remarkably empathetic and compasionate (as evidence I cite all the kindness and compasion to vulnerable bugs and animals that so many whom have responded to this thread have expressed).&nbsp; <br /><br />I find it strange that people look at the occasional nasty thing humans do and basically say &quot;well there ya go...humans are shit&quot;, but somehow ignore the far more common acts of kindness, compassion, and reason that are the absolute norm for people.&nbsp; If you were walking in back of an old lady and she stumbled, would you not absolutely instintively rush to her aid?&nbsp; Of course you would (or at least 99% of everyone would).&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because your&#039;re a natural human...and you&#039;re really nice.<br /><br />Polar bears on the other hand...not so much (he&#039;d eat the old lady for sure).&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Reason, I agree with you that most humans are empathetic and kind creatures. However, when we look at the big picture and our actions as a whole, what I see is obscene. Being rich is glorified while we leave so many people on their own to die in poverty. We are divided along bullshit lines by the media. Ethnicity, wealth, political parties, drug users.... Those in power care little about others.

				Great thread! <br /><br />i wish i had the faith in humanity some express here, however i dont- i as well try to respect all living organisms ( with few exceptions) but i cant imagine that the majority of the other 7 billion people feel the same- i think probably most people are just concerned with their own survival and cant or wont see beyond themselves- is this nature? is this natural? IDK<br /><br />but i think humans are one of if not the only species that is able to choose thier actions based on reason , abstract thought and delayed gratification ( ive heard of that, but never managed it- haha)- <br /><br />but realistically i feel that in the time since the indstrial revolution we have put this planet on a path that will lead to SEVERE collapse- not in our life time, or maybe even a thousand years, but it is IMHO inevitable ( at the rate we are going) and the industries and companies and politicains that are controlled by said interests, just dont care, in fact its in thier best interest to continue to make profits while thee is still a viable environment to exploit, is this natural, is this nature ? IDK, but it is certainly human.<br /><br />and as humans we ae given some time here and the ability to choose our attitude about it- and for me i try to take all the negativity and turn it into a sense of urgency for me to enjoy it, and if i can share it with others- because ive seen things change in front of my eyes and its got a ling slide down before anything starts to get better- for example i read where the annual migration in north america of monarch butterflies- one of the greatest mass migrations on the planet, which has been on going since time immemorial, is concerably small this year- but the truth is that is a miracle its lasted this long, they all congregate in a small area of mexico and if that area was not protected- it could have been logged long ago and thier breeding ground removed in one season and their continued existence would be tenuous at best- but fortunately its a tourist attraction<br /><br />and the examples can go on and on- mostly due to habitat loss, or over harvesting or pollution, fro example another of the great migrations on earth is the blue fin tuna which is slowly being hunted into extinction, and as they become fewer in size and number, their value increases and they are hunted more fiercely, and because they travel such huge distances even if they are protected in some areas, they will be caught in others- and there are no tourist protecting their breeding grounds-<br /><br />another example is the use of&nbsp; DDT in north america in the 50&#039;s &amp; 60&#039;s that almost extinguished the peregrine falcon and the bald eagle-<br /><br />the examples never end<br /><br />but i guess my point is the balance of the natural world is (IMHO) irrevocably unbalanced- so go enjoy it while we&#039;ve got it-<br /><br />but i really dig this thread and im glad to read all the optimism- thanks <br />

				Very interesting topic, and I&#039;ve put quite a lot of thought into this.&nbsp; Primarily, yes, I absolutely do think we are natural, and not &#039;above&#039; it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I think there are several different perspectives you can take on this subject.&nbsp; One belief that I do hold is that, universally speaking, human life is as valuable, or should I say, has as little value, as animals.&nbsp; In other words, a human life intrinsically has the same value as a bugs, which I think some people have great difficulty agreeing with.&nbsp; In the grand scheme of the universe, we are incredibly insignificant.<br /><br />However, as a species, of course we are going to value ourselves over other animals, and will be concerned primarily with our own development over other species&#039;, this seems perfectly natural to me.&nbsp; <br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t say we have some universal moral duty to protect the rest of nature per se, as you said we are a part of it, and simply a very advanced part of it.&nbsp; I think it is definitely relative, hence why some people prioritise it more than others, or don&#039;t really feel a duty to at all.<br /><br />My own personal belief is of course that despite my opinion that I first explained, I appreciate the complexity and beauty of the world and its creatures, so it does sadden me when I hear about a species dying out, or whatever, but of course, this is perfectly natural as well, almost every species that has ever existed on Earth has become extinct.&nbsp; At the same time, I find animal cruelty completely sickening and unnecessary.&nbsp; I think things like conservation is noble, but what does worry me is when people start to prioritise animals over humans in negative ways.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can&#039;t remember the exact details, but I remember hearing about some research facility that did animal testing, and protestors mailed one of those long tubes that posters are delivered in to one of the scientists in charge.&nbsp; It was basically a nail bomb that would detonate when opened, and his four year old daughter picked it up, fortunately she didn&#039;t open it and her father called the police.&nbsp; Dissent is fine, but to that extent I think it&#039;s completely unjustified regarding animal rights.&nbsp;

				Great topic!&nbsp; One of the things I love about the SR is the abundance of intelligent discussion and debate here in the forums.&nbsp; <br /><br />The more developed technology and machines become, the further from the &quot;circle of life&quot;, and natural selection human&#039;s become.&nbsp; Some may even argue humans are eliminating &quot;Natural selection&quot; as it&#039;s been known for thousands of years.&nbsp; We no longer rely on hunting and fishing to survive.&nbsp; For thousands of years, survival meant a human had to have a wide range of exceptional skills.&nbsp; Early &quot;man&quot; had to learn to work with the weather, seasons, and traveling herds.&nbsp; &quot;He&quot; had to learn to not over hunt the herds, ensuring plenty of meat year after year.&nbsp; &quot;Man&quot; had to put a great deal of thought into working with the circle of life so as not to deplete it.&nbsp; Naturally, a harmony developed.&nbsp; &nbsp;The more &quot;advanced&quot; we become with technology, the less we rely on these ancient insights and wisdom.&nbsp; I see this as a loss for humanity.<br /><br />The amount of energy needed for just &quot;living&quot; was great.&nbsp; &nbsp;People had to not only be physically strong, but mentally acute.&nbsp; Also, developing important relationships to ensure cooperation for survival were necessary.&nbsp; Today, if you have money, you really don&#039;t &quot;need&quot; any other skills to survive.&nbsp; Most people today have no idea what to hunt during all the months of the year.&nbsp; Very few can make their own shelter.&nbsp; &nbsp;Having cash means we have essentially found the cheat code for survival.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most people don&#039;t ever think about how they&#039;re going to survive.&nbsp; Can you imagine having to think of this every single day?&nbsp; And having to make daily decisions that ensure survival or end you and your family&#039;s life?&nbsp; &nbsp;The world is a far different place now.<br /><br />I think most environmentalists have good intentions.&nbsp; I am always surprised at how little some really understand about the actual circle of life.&nbsp; One example is the overpopulation of deer in residential areas.&nbsp; It&#039;s a fact that too many deer is a bad thing for the environment.&nbsp; Wolves naturally eat deer, but they&#039;ve been hunted close to extinction.&nbsp; Thinning the overpopulated deer herds helps lower disease rates, and ensures plenty of food for pregnant doe&#039;s and fawns.&nbsp; Yet so many environmentalists are against hunting deer?&nbsp; Most people who hunt deer eat all the meat.&nbsp; Some use the hide for a blanket.&nbsp; &nbsp; Many hunters say a small prayer of thanks to the deer when it&#039;s killed.&nbsp; In a way, the hunted deer lives on through the people who ingest it&#039;s meat.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t see how that same &quot;environmentalist&quot; can go to the grocery store and buy cow meat from an animal that lived in torturous conditions it&#039;s entire life.<br /><br />And reproduction has certainly changed how man is evolving!&nbsp; &nbsp;We can now produce human&#039;s in a lab dish.&nbsp; This to me is scarey stuff!&nbsp; I think bypassing natural reproduction is asking for trouble.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can understand a young couple who&#039;s been unsuccessfully trying to get pregnant, and thus getting fertility treatments, or eggs implanted.&nbsp; &nbsp;But creating animals and people in a pietre(spelling?)&nbsp; dish?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />There is a certain balance in the animal kingdom.&nbsp; It&#039;s violent, but it&#039;s also reliable and sensible.&nbsp; Everything happens in cycles.&nbsp; Seasons, weather, hibernation, new spring growth, traveling herds, etc.&nbsp; Being aware of and being able to benefit from these known cycles made for a very rich life.&nbsp; Knowing that something wants to eat you is as real as it gets.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />To thrive today, most emphasis is placed upon developing a set of business skills.&nbsp; Once the money is made, we don&#039;t have to worry about hunting, fishing, collecting and drying wood for heat and cooking, making clothing to keep us warm, maintaining a good shelter, and solidifying community relationships for our survival.&nbsp; So I&#039;d sadly argue that we are no longer part of nature.

				I was discussing this topic with some mates the other day, and to a certain extent everyone is correct as it&#039;s down to perception and language.<br /><br />Everything on this planet is part of nature, some things may be modified by forces from a non-human source (perceived as natural, the Sun or a volcano) and others from a human using tools, one appears random/chaotic and another with intent but the result is the same. We are a product of nature and so the things we produce must also be from &#039;nature&#039; at least vicariously. I get that we have consciousness and that separates us from many of the other inhabitants of the planet, and perhaps it does come with some form of responsibility, but primarily for our own survival - which relies on the survival of our natural environment. We share at least that with every other species on the planet.<br /><br />The idea that we could or even need to save the planet is ridiculous, what we can and should be trying to save is the environment that allows us to live. If a species is so stupid that it will cut down rain forests and therefore some of it&#039;s own air supply to fund the paper industry, it perhaps deserves to become extinct. Hemp could produce all of the world&#039;s paper far more efficiently with far less impact on life on this planet and yet we choose wood-based paper. What kind of a government decides that fracking is a good decision when there is clear evidence globally that it probably isn&#039;t? Even the smallest risk of water contamination should deter us especially when there are other options, not because we want to save the planet but because we should want to save ourselves! <br /><br />It&#039;s not us that are unnatural, it&#039;s the concepts we created - money for example, money runs this world, it is a force as great as gravity for most of us and yet it is completely alien. It&#039;s money that leads to our lives being at risk and those of other species. We&#039;ll do anything for a bit of money, and more fool us.<br /><br />In the end we are not that important at all, who knows how many worlds there have been before ours even on this planet, a few billion years is a very long time, we may fuck ourselves out of existence but the Earth will barely notice we were even here. Another glitch. Hopefully the next lot will do a bit better (possibly Ant-people?).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

				If human was a part of nature they would know they are herbavores..<br /><br />Now they think they are scavangers and that they lack empathy for the animals who gets tortured and killed by a machine behind closed doors, humans are very good at ignoring the negative sides of themselves and society, and they are the ones who will fail now when Earth is going to react to what humanity has done to her under the last 100 years.<br /><br />Chinese who eat dogs are really sick people compared to the people in the western world who love their cats and dogs, but the pigs and cows are less worth and they can be tortured behind closed doors thats no problem for the people in the western world.<br /><br />Its a problem if they did look into a slaughterhouse then they would stop eating animals instantly, so its important that we keep the door closed so we can treat humans for their disease later when they get sick. How else we goiing to survive if we dnt let people get sick so we can make money from the sicknesses? <br /><br />Im sorry but most of humanity are psycopaths and they think they can live of other beings missery just because &quot;the god&quot; in the bible told them humanity can take advantage of every animal on the planet. =(<br /><br />The designer of all life did not design books , the designer of all life designed the feelings inside you that lets you know right from wrong and that its wrong when animals gets tortured.<br /><br />The problem is probably that people are atheist dumbasses or religious dumbasses and they dont belive in higher powers and they also believe in death since otherwise the ones cntrolling humanity would have some problems if people know that there is&nbsp; no end to life and that wha you do in this life will deside what you will be doing in your next life.<br /><br />Fear of death and ignorance to the higher powers in this world is probably the rootcause.<br /><br />What youre opinion?

				Man can accept god saving humanity, but man can&#039;t accept being a god himself and save humanity himself..<br />/ I dont remember who said it, might be Tsarion.<br /><br />People are really afraid now since they know they aint living in harmony with nature or animals..<br /><br />People think they will be alright but inside them they know it will not continue forever if you aint living in<br />harmony with nature since when to much nature has been transformed into piles of garbage then its game over..<br />They just continue consuming the bullshit products created to break so people have to buy new produucts for ever, <br />or should I say until its game over since things like that can never continue forever.<br /><br />Electrical and hydrogen cars exists, people ignore it and continue burning oil and destroying the planet and they believe they aint responsible hahahaa<br /><br />Only if they knew they are responsible for every action they do on this planet, then they would not be destroying their homeplanet because they <br />dumbed down beyond belif and they dont realise its game&nbsp; over soon if we dont change.<br /><br />Prophecys are created to show humanity the future so every human can change their ways and change the path and avoid the prophecy, <br />the bible contains a prophecy about lucifer, the marks of the beast and dooomsday, and when Obama talks about eveyone should put a <br />microchip in your arm.. Then will just do it since they dont know they are walkin into the abyss and loosing their souls when they put a <br />microchip of the beast into their body... game over.<br /><br />People will get the chance to become millionairs by getting chipped thru the NESARA proposition, little do they know theywill loose their <br />soul and dreams and ideas will never happen again since having a soul is kinda special while the only ones who dont know that are the <br />soulpeople, sunchildren, humanity..<br /><br />Money aint shit, its a slaverytool used to destroy humanity and Earth.

				You have to disagree because you still believe bullshit and you dont have the skills to look it up on google, the differences between herbavores, scavangers and omnivores..<br /><br />Herbavores have jaws that move sideways for grinding herbs, carnivores bite straight and it for biting and killing prey and a jaw that goes sideways would not work for that.<br /><br />Herbavores have a very long bowel, DESIGNED to digest herbs over long periods of time, while carnivores has a short bowel for getting rid of the meats fast before it gets rotten.<br /><br />Carnivores and scavangers dont have to cook their animals to be able to eat them since they got substances in their stomach that is DESIGNED to deal with the bacterias of rotten or raw meats.<br />&nbsp;<br />Herbavores need to cook an kill the bacteria in foods before eating dead animalmuscles.<br /><br />You did not evolve from monkey you damn monkey, aliens created humanity in labs then they had to go because of the karma they created when dealing with genetic modification.<br /><br />You just writing lies upon lies and you have no idea that karma does not give a fuk if you know what youre talkin about or if you just spreading bullshitinfo because youre dumbed down. If people listen to the lies you repeat because the beast who tricked you to repeat that bullshit without having science to back up what youre sayin, then youre messing yoursellf up by creating karma.<br /><br />deprogram that bullshit the schools taught you since it very backwardsinfo..<br /><br />if you care about yourself that is but I know you dont since if you did you would had noticed some lies on this sick planet of misdirected love.

				Thats the thing Im talkin about, your opinions does not matter since everyone can use google and get the info im talkin about, I know youre opinion is that what I know is just my opinions and we have different opinions, but I dont have opinions like that i let the evidence speak first, then I make my opinion based on it..<br /><br />You do the opposite you have opinions on the evidence and your opinion is that there is no evidence hahahaa<br /><br />Now i do know much about your intelligence level since youre telling me about the slavecathegory you have been trained to be able to do.<br /><br />My slavecathegory is a computer software programmer.. But my job is truthseeking, sharing and caring with the ones I can reach.<br /><br />Im not insulting anyone Im insulting the idea of having opinions on the evidences avalible online in theese last days. I dont know you I only know what you write, so how in the hell on Earth can I insult YOU by writing about your stupid opinions based on belifs.. Youre sounding like one of those girls who think their self confidense was destroyed by w hat someone else said.. But its a impossibility to make you feel bad about yourself if you aint bad yourself and knows about it.<br /><br />You probably realised youre a part of animals cruelty by eating animals and now you wanna tell me that Im the problem since you cant admit its embarresing that someone had to wake you up and tell you its wrong to be a part of animals cruelty because others do it.<br /><br />I know how you feel since I was ashamed of myself for having to listen to someoone who woke me up and made me look into a slaughterhouse just to realise what I was a part of, none should have to wake me up to not be a part of animal cruelty, since I was a psycopath by just eatning animals and ignoring what they have felt going into the slaughterhouse to be tortured and killed so I can eat shitty dead foods and kill myself slowly..<br /><br />Its all love tho but in this world of misdirected love I know many will see this as some kind of attack but trust me, i dont know you and I have been in your shoes before so I innerstand what youre going thru reading this truths I was sharing.<br /><br />And its not easy admitting youre a dumbass who is a part of animal cruelty just because aliens thaught you that youre a damn omnivore, and you trust them thats why you never used google to look it up what kind of bodydesign the human body is. =(<br /><br />Anyway, its all love, but its real love I know it might be new to many of you but some of you know what thisis and they will listen and take care of themselves and thats all that I wanted.<br /><br />Peace

				It says humanity was created in labs on all the pyramidewalls and monuments all over the planet since they built those so we could evolve and know there are higher powers in this world, but I actually heard this from the creators themselves since they are present and they still got love for humanity but they know about the evil aliens that enslaved humanity after they left because of karmareasons when they had created humanity.<br /><br />So our goodhearted alien creators from higher dimensions ar here for the ones who are still humans and they want us to know about the aliens who anslaved humanity and that their slavery is over and its about to get out of this hole before the planet turns into a cold desert just like the evil aliens want.<br /><br />The evil ailens dont have a home and most of humanity dont cae about their home so they are moving in and eating most of humanity because they ate animals and created karma that made them stuck in this dimension, forced to be food for the ones at te top of the foodchain.<br />Stop the challenging since this is not a competition , thats slavethinking if you think Im here to compete with yall since you already have all the answers if you just repeat what the slaveowners old you to repeat.<br /><br />Normal clever humans will look it up thru the internet if they hear something important like its a fire in the house or aliens are spaying the sky to block the sun out so they can come down and eat people.. Normal people would listen with big open ears if someone came with info like that.<br /><br />You have no evidence that politicians are humans since they start wars and divide and conquer humanity like its a game, and it is a game for them but we also in this game of life and ther are many aliens in human bodies to.<br /><br />They created us as sungods basicly and our pineal gland is the seat of the soul and our soul is the sun, and theese aliens controlling humanity are soul-less and the sun burns the shit out of them thats why they have to block it out and make you drink flouride and poisons to calcify/disable your pineal gland, in other words youre higher being then them and they cant even come close to you without a soul of their own so they have to calcify your pineal gland before they can take over your body. and thats what they are doing, they are going to try to get to a higher dimension by takin peoples bodies over and try to do the rebirth in 4-7 years, but they will burn at the gates/portals since we are going thru the sun to the 5th dimension and only the ones who is crystalized on the inside will be able to do that and them are the ones who eat living fruit and veggies instead of dead animal and human muscles.<br /><br />Look up the hidden history of humanity since they hav found stonetablets in a undestructable material that shows the hidden history of humanity and how the pyramids was buildt and why, they was basicly buildt to make humanity evolve very fast since the time was short, just a few tousands of years until rebirth. only 4-7 years until it happens now.<br /><br />It will be chaos on the plaet until then tho just like it says in the bible and on the pyramidewalls probably also. Its no secret, only to the sleeping sheeple who think everything is wonderfull.<br /><br />I dont know if that answered your question or anything since im still unclear about if it was even a question or a damn competitionpruposal since Im not so into that, Im into sharing and caring but its no competition an i dont like calling myself any kind of cathegories in this world, not even a swede since the countries was created by the slaveowners just to divide and conquerer.<br /><br />Shure call youreslef americans or mexicans or swedes, but youre just calling yourself the cathegory that slaveowners created for you to put yourself into it and get stuck int this dimension.<br /><br />Take care man, much love, peace

				To bad this thread derailed a bit, lets get back on track!<br /><br />In the end I think it all ends up on what the definition is that we give to the word nature. Personally I dont think that there is such a thing as free choice and that everything what happens happens because of the fact that our universe (multiverse?) is a state machine reacting on previous actions into a never ending chaotic state. Since that is all the same you can argue that either everything must be natural or nothing must be. <br /><br />Is the state machine we live in (are part of) natural or not? That is the question and its one we will never figure out. We will probably not even find a definition of the word natural what everyone can agree on.<br /><br />

				watch this and then hear me out:<br /><br />Doug Stanhope - Animal &quot;trainers&quot; are assholes http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eavEZfVrUjw<br /><br />humans are trained to jump&nbsp; thru hoops when kids gets foorced to go to school because governments and parents know their kids will be best of as slaves when they get older, so a few people can get rich from their workefforts..<br /><br />Its the same as the killerwhale who bite the head of its trainer because she holds the food infront of the killerwhales face tryin to make the killerwhale act in unnatural ways.<br /><br />Nature is about to bite the head of humans who live outside of nature and enjoy eating animals and watchin wild animals in cages and jumping thru hoops since human slaves like to watch animal slaves do unnatural things instead of walkin into nature and watchin the animals in nature.<br /><br />humans are a part of nature, the beast aliens want us outside of nature, and they want us to enjoy watchin animal slaves outside of their natural life.<br /><br />Am I wrong about this you think? <br /><br />

				My belief - we&#039;re as much a part of nature as the trees, seas and mountains. We, humanity, are just doing what we have evolved to do - think, create, destroy, fuck-up, redeem ourselves .. we are what we are. <br /><br />I think that it&#039;s somewhat arrogant of us to assume that we&#039;re somehow outside of the world from which we came. I think it&#039;s a mistake to try and keep everything exactly the same as it was before modern humans built cities and factories. The natural world outside of humanity has made many many drastic climate changes all on it&#039;s own long before homo-sapiens showed up; at least 4 ice ages and a multitude of warming periods. If for some misguided reason we collectively decide that we should have no (zero) environmental impact on the world then at what state should it be kept? Pre-industrial revolution? Pleistocene ages? Jurassic era? 1980? <br /><br />Having said all that we probably want to keep things nice and comfy for future human existence. Moderate regulation of greenhouse gas and environmental chemical restrictions are probably a wise thing as too much change too quickly probably ain&#039;t all that great either. This is what we are most likely meant to do as our natural innate intelligence and human wisdom kind of points in that direction. I&#039;m fairly certain though that everything is as it was meant to be. The natural world is not always a kind and gentle place.<br /><br />... OR we could listen to Roger and rebel against aliens who created us to be sun-god slaves before they eat us .. or something. I apologize to Roger if he is in fact schizophrenic.

				They have been dumping barrels of nuclear waste in the world ocean since 1940&#039;s. Fact look it up. They even dropped barrels on the boats of Greenpeace once while they was filming it. Its avalible for the world to see on youtube.<br /><br />All fishes in the oceans have poinson in them from paperproduction-factories or mills or what ever.. This is something they tested in Sweden where I live, and there in not one single sea of water in Sweden that has poisonfree fishes.<br /><br />In the places where they clean the water from cities they are unable to clean every poisonous substance from the water so they let the worldocean clean the substances they cant clean from the water.. They just pump it out there for future generations hahaha like there will be one on this Earth. come on lets be serious and stop dreaming.&#039;<br /><br />The airplanes have been spraying chemtrails for 10 years now in almost every country on the planet, AND over the oceans, go and look at satelite pictures before the media edits the white lines all over the oceans and countries all over the planet.. Fact, let the evidence speak and stop playing like a noob in the game of life.<br /><br />Products are buildt to break so people have to go buy new products all the time, they even got schools that teach humans how to make products break after they have been used for a while, some companies put small microchips into their products so the product will shut down after the warranty runs out, fact this is nothing I am makin up and this is turning rich natue into piles of garbage and we dont yet have a solution to where all the poisonous trash should be stored. <br /><br />The rich countries sells their trash to the poorer countries where the corrupt leaders dump it in nature somewhere since there is no laws there and polices or even reporters sometimes that can tell the peoples about it.<br /><br />So we are all living on borrowed time to be honest, oilspills and factoryfarming totaly destroys the envoriment to.<br /><br />And when BP sprayed poisons into the oceans using airplanes just so their oilspills would sink was kinde uneccesary since we only have 1 world ocean on this round planet so we can never push away poisons anywhere since gravity holds all the poisons here for a very long time.<br /><br />I think you should grow up and stop calling me names bc you think you need to protect yourself from the truth, Im saying there is a way out of this but its thru the sun and onto the New Earth in the 5th dimension.<br /><br />But for you to do that you need to detach from all the destruction of mother Earth and activate your third eye and stop creating karma by eating animals for example.<br /><br />You dont destroy nature when you eat fruit and veggies, I say your poop are delicious for other trees then yourself,we have a common destiny with the trees, they give us food and we give them food when we poop out the fruits.<br /><br />I also was talkin earlier about selling and buying human vegetarian poop and turning it into food by giving it as food to the fruitbearing trees..<br /><br />But I guess people rather run in a damn hamsterwheel and go buy the freefood to the ones who put a fence around the trees that was put here for all of humanity, for FREE..<br /><br />You got that stockholmsyndrome and believe me i know what that syndrome does to people since I live in the country where they first noticed it and gave it a name. People are afraid to get killed if they talked about how they are getting killed. And thats very bad gamingskills in the game of life to be honest. ;P<br /><br />Peace folks do what ever you want, hate me for pointing out the truth buut youre only hating yourself probably thats why you hate the truth and the ones who bring it. Aint many getting out of this alive. around 15% of humanity is what i have heard. The rest will not see the need of detachin from everything that is destroying humanity and Earth. =(<br /><br />Much love
