				Ive been using a lot of psychedelics and have recently been thinking heavily about suicide... My lifes fine and all, but I&#039;m far removed. I had one close friend left I lost. He said maybe we&#039;d see eachother in another lifetime, and goodbye, cutting off all contact. weird in my opinion, especially for someone I&#039;ve known so well...<br /><br />So I feel like its time to move on learn more, enter &#039;hyperspace as a light being&#039;... I was wodering if anyones had near death experiences and could give my advice?<br /><br />I imagine suicide as walking into a black hole. Noone who goes in returns to tell about what its like... but clearly our souls are eternal. The black souls lead somewhere people havent been before

				All scientific evidence currently most strongly supports the notion that when you die your ability to perceive and think cease to be, causing &#039;you&#039; to enter a state most similar to extremely deep sleep, although even more so. There is no scientific evidence for an eternal soul, and all religions promising eternal life after death have been thoroughly debunked and believing in any of them is essentially the same as believing in arbitrary bullshit. One of the leading theories of the end fate of our universe is that it will enter into a state of heat death, in which change ceases to be. This means that our universe is likely not cyclic, and there will not be a new singularity formed or a new expansion, and therefor there is no chance that you will reemerge from the singularity again after you die. The probability that a neural network making up your consciousness will be recreated in the remainder of time up until heat death is likely to be infinitesimally low. Pretty much your only hope for life after death is a multiverse with eternal inflation. However, in many multiverse models it is predicted that there is already at least one other life form equal to you somewhere in reality, and considering the fact that your ability to perceive doesn&#039;t seem to stretch to this clone it seems likely that after you die here you will not suddenly be able to see through the eyes of your counterpart in the multiverse. Also, the multiverse is not even proven and it probably never will be, and many physicists see the notion of a multiverse as being more religious than scientific.<br /><br />Near death experiences are not the same thing as death experiences. If you want to experience a near death experience I suggest that you snort approximately 250 miligrams of ketamine, which will also probably have the added benefit of giving you temporary relief from depression lasting for some weeks, as you are probably actually depressed if you are contemplating suicide, even if you claim otherwise. Other than that I would lay off of the psychedelics for a while because you don&#039;t want to get so far out there that you kill yourself trying to have a spiritual experience.<br /><br />Failing that you may want to consider joining a cult, your beliefs seem to map with heavens gate pretty well, unfortunately for you they already blasted off into heaven on a spaceship hidden by a comet.

				Why do all my former friends say &quot;youd make a good cult leader&quot; or &quot;go join a cult&quot; Like, gee, thanks. Anyway the ketamine idea didnt work<br /><br />The way you put this information&nbsp; into words makes little sense... If youd explain it in another ay Id still love to read it. But ibogaine basically taught me that if I commit suicide, then Ill pick up where I left off, still learning. Ill have better circumstances in my new life.

				people who are in with the reincarnation stuff are doing it because they had some glimmer of a memories from a past life. Don&#039;t buy into my friend. My hypothesis is that basically the energy is recycled. Bare with me. Yea the same energies is re used but not individualized. It is thrown back into the main energies and mixed back up. Expanded if you will and new life energies are given or taken , or assigned ( however it&#039;s easier for you to understand) to the newly conceived of the world INCLUDING ALL LIFE FORMS. <br /><br />People are individuals and some claim to have recollections from another life. Maybe true but the truth is they don&#039;t have no clear thoughts of actually being somebody else. Everyone that ever researches out somebody they think they were in a past life ends up finding loads of differences in them&nbsp; and their selves.<br /><br />I agree a lot with what kmfkewm said. When you die your gone and the earth and the rest of the planets are being drawn into the sun slowly. I sometimes think that if there is a God then maybe he put this whole thing in place as a scientific experiment but can only watch now. The world was set up for us in the beginning and it is what we make of it. Have you ever heard that song &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot;? Well if you look for the bad and stay negative then you will find what you are looking for like that as well. All negative experiences.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mean no body really knows til they byte the fucking bullet and stay dead right? I&#039;ve had out of body experiences and could not tell nothing from it about life after death. I can say for certain that we each have full control over our own thoughts and whatever thoughts you have are what causes you to feel however it is you feel. Music is a good way to get out of a bad mind set. Something up beat that you love. <br /><br />There are people who get tired of living and they start thinking about death and not long after they die. When you are truly ready to die you won&#039;t have to do any suicide it&#039;ll come to you. Man fuck that shit tho. I say DIE HARD BRO! You only have one life and that life is meant to experience and enjoy all that life has to offer including growing old<br /><br />So the Ket idea did not work?

				I don&#039;t have much to add, but feel that I should mention that I&#039;ve recovered from some terrible depressive episodes to live a healthy and reasonably happy life. That means anyone else can too. It always worries me when I hear talk of suicide.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been extremely fortunate to have only known a couple people who took their own lives, but I did have a good friend hang himself this past spring. It left a lot of us with a heavy cross to bear, so I feel inclined to point that things can (and do) get better for most people.<br /><br />FWIW, even though I&#039;m a man of faith who believes that is not for me to decide when the gift of life ends, I think science also points in the direction of the end of life being all there is.

				A person is a focused illusion of being, and death occurs when the illusion of being is no longer sustained. Then everything flows out, and away from the disequilibrium state that is life. It is a state of disequilibrium, yet it is maintained for decades, but finally, like all disequilibrium states, it must yield to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, and at that point it runs down, its specific character disappears into the general character of the world around it. It has returned then to the void/plenum. <br /><br />What I imagine happens is that for the self time begins to flow backward, even before death; the act of dying is the act of reliving an entire life, and at the end of the dying process consciousness divides into the consciousness of one&#039;s parents and one&#039;s children, and then it moves through these modalities, and then divides again<br /><br />It&#039;s moving forward into the future through the people who come after you, and backward into the past through your ancestors. The further away from the moment of death it is, the faster it moves, so that after a period of time, some say 42 days, one is reconnected to everything that ever lived, and the previous ego-pointed existence is allowed to dissolve, returned to the ocean, the morphogenetic field, God, or the One of Plotinus--you choose your term.<br /><br />

				Only way is to find out yourself. Only then will you experience what 100+ billion people have experienced. Don&#039;t think just because you deem it &quot;trancendal suicide&quot; it&#039;s going to be any different.<br /><br />Who knows? Maybe what you think will happen will happen. Or maybe we&#039;re part of the matrix. Or maybe you become a god.<br /><br />Or maybe you&#039;ll just Darwin yourself.

				I&#039;d recommend you implement some sort of suicide &quot;waiting period&quot;, where no matter how much you want to kill yourself, you have to wait a certain amount of time before you can actually carry it out. I think at least one, or much preferably two-three years is a good amount of time to wait. This helps mainly because things do get better over time, and suicide isn&#039;t something you want to be impulsive about. The way you feel &quot;removed&quot; right now will pass, but suicide is fairly permanent.<br /><br />Transcendental suicide? Yes, the atoms and energy in your body will flow into the river of the universe and all, but unfortunately no, you will not experience consciousness in the way you do now ever again. That&#039;s why now is special, and since our lifetime is so short already I don&#039;t see how making it shorter is really a solution to anything at all.<br /><br />EDIT: Almost forgot to mention: TRAVEL!! Contrary to what the news media would have you believe, our planet and the people on it are amazing. I doubt you&#039;ve seen every corner of it, you should really check out more of it before you enter hyperspace as a light being because you might not make it back to Earth then.

				To me suicide is a sign of weakness. Well always has been in my situations with the people I know. U are different . You want knowledge.?? Why??? Why question the unknown that you will never know. When u die u will just die like there is nothing else. A huge release of dmt into the brain I think and nothing else. No othef conciusness. Is there not any more girls u wana fuck or new people u wana meet. Its a very materialistic world and I love every minute of it. <br /><br />I don&#039;t ever want to die I just want to go do what I love. Whixh is fishing and chaseing girls and doing drugs.

The brain is merely an organ of forgetfulness.&nbsp; It is like a sponge filled with images of this world of illusion and of heaviness. It deals with relativity and illusion. Intellectual intuition, on the other hand, is the latent remembrance of the Absolute, hidden deep down in our &quot;I&quot;. It is far greater than the merely sensual knowledge of illusory things which is obtained by the brain.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again, how can you be SURE of this? All what you talk as if you are certain that it is what it is, can be just a certainty arising from an experience that comes itself from a chemical change in the brain AND NOTHING MORE. You cannot be sure one way or another. It&#039;s futile that you try to pretend that you can be sure, you cannot. It&#039;s just that you simply cannot admit it even to yourself.<br /><br />What we humans can do is just experience and relate what it SEEMS to be like from what we experience. We can only guess based on that experience and what it seems like it is the &quot;truth&quot; from that personal experience, but we will never be able to be certain that what it may seem is then really what is happening, just because we cannot have an objective look at the thing from an outside (and hence objective) medium. <br /><br />Consciousness and hence all experiences tied with it can just be a result of a physical reaction or stimuli, as it can be totally the contrary or a thing in-between. We will never know one way or the other.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The brain exists only within the mind. &quot;Chemicals&quot; are just ideas in your head.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />And those &quot;ideas&quot; can still be tied to that physical organ we call &quot;brain&quot;, or not; the &quot;mind&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; can also be a result of that same physical organ or not. There&#039;s no way to know.<br /><br />All you perceive and you are can just be only a complete physical (and hence totally mortal and finite) result or completely the opposite or a thing in-between. Basing hypothesis on the experiences you have is fine and good (we humans are in this world just to experience and base hypothesis on those), but still you have ALWAYS to take in consideration the full picture, because elsewhere you are just pretending to call as truth something that cannot be called such because an absolute truth requires an objective certainty that you cannot have, one way or another. You cannot extrapolate the objective from the subjective in the case of humans, so you cannot discern the objective.

				Joywind I don&#039;t know what to say to you exept I am a nieve fool. And I want to stay that way. Intead of questioning my excistance I would rather do watever I can to make my excistance the best it can be. I have always wondered what life was and why we were here. But since I&#039;ve started using psychedelics its had the opposite effect on me than most. Whatever excistance is is just to powerful for me to understand and instead of wondering about it for the rest of my life I just want to make the best of it.<br /><br />I have had a few friends commit suicide and it wasn&#039;t to find the meaning of excistance it was because they were weak and couldn&#039;t make good out of thier life. <br /><br />I&#039;m not scared of death by the way I have experienced my death many times through my eyes and others. I don&#039;t see it as a bad thing. It is beutiful and sad at the same time. I love all people and all things I just never want to lose that. Thats my weakness. I&#039;m sorry if I sound ignorant because well I am a little ignorant but we all have our beliefs<br /><br />Sorry for spelling and stuff. I&#039;m doing this off my phone and a little intoxicated. +1 to u joywind for the good explination on how u feel

However it is even more important to be able to work with what you experience, instead than asking what it really is what you experience and blocking yourself from doing it.<br /><br />&quot;If power stops and asks why then it is power weakness&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=180932.msg1360595#msg1360595">Quote from: ProudCannabian on July 20, 2013, 02:36 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should you be complacent in your knowledge, and just &quot;be?&quot;&nbsp; What is the point of that?&nbsp; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The point is: is it really so important to know what &quot;love&quot; is, for example? Or is it more important to embrace that love to the fullest?<br />Is it more important to know why you can do a thing or be able to do it? Is it more important to know what a thing really is or be able to work practically with that thing and have benefits from it? Is it more important to know how it is that you as an human were created or to experience being it to the fullest?<br /><br />You can say that one thing doesn&#039;t necessarily invalidate the other, and it is true, but if the &quot;why&quot; becomes more important than the &quot;do&quot;, if the &quot;because&quot; stops the action, than this can happen, and you harm your experiencing with your research. It is like a runner beginning to focus on the way his legs works to the point of obstacolating their natural function and slow himself down.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=180932.msg1360595#msg1360595">Quote from: ProudCannabian on July 20, 2013, 02:36 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Should we not learn anything and everything we can to participate in the survival and advancement of life on Earth?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Naturally. But is it wiser to waste your life to learn how can you participate correctly (and probably never being able to) or to simply participate? Both things are important and have to co-exists, but if your asking why you do exist comes to the point of blocking your actual existence then you are actually killing yourself while pretending you are searching a way to live.<br /><br />The point is that many of the &quot;why&quot; man has he will probably never be able to discover because the mystery is too vast and there are no ways to do connections between two things when the gap is too large. We humans are at the center of what we experience, we cannot be outside of it and as such we can&#039;t be able to look at what we experience from the outside so as to have an objective view at it. Certain questions are so outside our possibility to provide an answer upon that it is futile to even try since doing so, given the complexity, will just stop you from simply acting and enjoying the process.

				I do agree with some of what you&#039;re saying.<br />If in the end, we discovered that we are all just a chemical cocktail that became sentient by chance, and there is no after-death consciousness, wouldn&#039;t that make life unbearable for some, and remove a lot of the joy of it for others.<br />Certainly.<br />Every person has a different view of joy though. To a scientist exploring the universe and/or consciousness you would perhaps find joy and excitement in the more mechanical way things are, in the same way a devout Christian may find joy waving snakes in the air and wiggling their heads in epileptic ecstasy.<br /><br />People these days definitely exercise their right to remain as educated as they please. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s wrong to chase answers, if that&#039;s what you enjoy.&nbsp; The thing about &quot;strong beliefs&quot; is that people who hold them will seldom relinquish them for anything - even cold hard facts.&nbsp; So I don&#039;t think any harm is inherent in allowing the search, and I don&#039;t think many of those scientists do so at the expense of their enjoying life.<br /><br />I would never end my existence to see what is on the other side, as I will be there soon enough.&nbsp; I don&#039;t NEED that answer right away.&nbsp; We are here on this planet so briefly - I feel it&#039;s important for us to find our joy and exercise it to the fullest, as long as it does not impinge upon the joy of others.&nbsp; That includes future generations, so it is not a selfish joy at the expense of our world or the people in it.&nbsp; My joy is bringing joy to others, now and in the future.
