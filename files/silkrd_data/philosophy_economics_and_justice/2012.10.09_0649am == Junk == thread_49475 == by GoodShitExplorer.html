				love /l…ôv/<br /><br />Noun:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An intense feeling of deep affection: &quot;their love for their country&quot;.<br /><br />Verb:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feel a deep romantic or sexual attachment to (someone): &quot;do you love me?&quot;.<br /><br />Synonyms:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noun.&nbsp; affection - fondness - darling - passion<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;verb.&nbsp; like - be fond of - fancy - adore<br /><br />Well, I never experienced it and i did shag quite a few girls, but I guess shagging is not the purpose of love. My best guess would be that you fall in love when you find that person that understands you, has the same thoughts, the persona that you can happily share your small amount of happiness with, from time to time. It would be nice to find it at some point but there is no rush there are plenty semi-retarded hot girls out there that don&#039;t mind you sticking your dick in them.<br /><br />That being said, + I&#039;ve heard people saying that the brain is the most outstanding organ. It works for 24 hours, 365 days, right from your birth until you fall in love.<br /><br />We can only come to a conclusion fucking random is better.<br />

				Love is merely an animal instinct which urges your body to procreate with a suitable partner as is demonstrated by the fact that you can fall in love over and over again.<br /><br />Once you have created offspring with that person that is when any relationship really gets difficult, because those impulses are not longer necessary as they have served their function. <br /><br />Although this argument is somewhat vulnerable to the notion of homosexual love which is beyond the realms of purely procreation.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Love is what anyone wants to make it. It can be love between a husband and wife or an elderly lady and her cat. We can&#039;t have the love Romeo and Juliet had, and even their love was flawed. LOVE is what you make it, so LIVE as if today is your last day, LAUGH until you can&#039;t laugh no more, and LOVE like you&#039;ve never been hurt :)

				I wrote this at the start of this year, I doubt any of you will agree.<br /><br />&quot;i once thought love was the desire for two people to be come one; a carnal lust for anti-amitosis. i had come to this conclusion after many unsatisfactory embraces with high-school sweethearts, where no matter how long and how securely i held those loves ones, there was some urge for intimacy unsatisfied. <br />upon later reflection i realised that i was in fact a teenage boy and what i was yearning for was penetration.<br />in saying that, i believe love extends beyond reproduction and biological obligations. i now believe that love is more about being seperate than a whole.<br />love is an exchange, not of body fluids, but of energy in a way similar to opposite magnets, or &#039;opposites attract&#039;.<br />the metaphor i have found best to describe my perception of love is the photovoltaic cells of the solar cell, belonging to the solar panel.<br />imagine one partner to be silicon bonded with phosphorus, and the other to be silicon bonded with boron.<br />silicon+phosphorus has extra electrons, and silicon+boron has &#039;electron holes&#039; to fill.<br />in my metaphor, an electron is an element of a person&#039;s personality: characteristics, mannerisms, interestsm etc.<br />upon contact these two substances (siliconp and siliconb) want very much to undergo a chemical reaction and become a new compound, to become one, for one is positively charged, and the other negatively.<br />the two partners want to know all their is to know about the other person, they want to be interested in what the other is interested in, do what the other does, and so forth.<br />but if these chemicals did have a reaction and become a new whole there would also be a byproduct as well as this new whole, as in all chemical reactions.<br />this byproduct is all the characteristics lost by each person in their bid to impress the other, or to suit their views/interests.<br />opinions lost.<br />lifelong familiar annoying habits thwarted.<br />and on top of this, if they are to become one, there is no two to be attracted to each other, no positive and negative charge, just one or the other.<br />and so the two move on and go on to seek new chemicals that are charged accordingly to their attractions, and the initial romance is lost.<br />this is one example of a failed relationship.<br />what dialogue exists between two identical people, or one person?<br />in a photovoltaic cell, when silicon p and silicon b make contact, their electrons and characteristics rush at each other, but instead of a reaction they meet at a junction of metal and mix, and eventually they form a barrier between them.<br />this barrier makes it harder and harder for electrons (characteristics) to flow from one side to the other.<br />eventually an equilibrium is reached and we have an electrical field separating the two sides. (this is how a solar cell generates electricity; irrelevant)<br />this energy, this electricity itself is what i believe love to be, it is the product of each other&#039;s attraction to each other&#039;s individualism.<br />it is the erratic yet comfortable dance of the two people constantly exchanging everything and yet remaining unique in themselves.<br />this equilibrium is known in the contemporary as &#039;giving each other space&#039;, this is what lets there be subject for discussion at the end of the day, regardless of how many thousands of discussions have been had, this is what gives us the sexual drive to exchange sensations and pleasures which crescendo into a short-lived high voltage electrical field that joins our body not as a whole but as a ying and yang.<br />two inseparable but seperate beings.&quot;

				Love happens during the emotional collocation of two deficient psychoses. Love either &#039;takes&#039; or doesn&#039;t take. The circumstances need to be right for love to occur, but most or all the deficiencies need to be reconciled. The positive emotions we feel when in love result from the feelings of satisfaction we get when our deficiencies are either fully or partially reconciled or when they are accepted by another.<br /><br />Not at all romantic and if my wife asks me why I love her I&#039;m not repeating the above, but &#039;tis what I believe.

				there&#039;s no way to define something subjective like love imho. It&#039;s a word attributed to many different symptoms and behavior patterns - but everyone experiences it differently I guess. I&#039;d compare it to an addiction though :D

				I believe a fair few people are incapable of experiencing love.<br />Love is when your willing to put someones happiness before your own.<br />When I was a teenager I fell madly in love with a girl two years above me a school. We used to spend every day together, laughing, joking, smoking weed, she was the most beautiful girl I&#039;ve ever met! Turned out she was a lesbian. We still remain good friends till this day.

				It is hard to describe love and easier to give an example of an action that I feel shows love. <br /><br />I am no longer with my girlfriend but she is pregnant and we are still civil and hang out. We definitely don&#039;t get a long and she is thick headed and more stubborn than an ass. <br /><br />Anyways, I currently haven&#039;t been talking to her for a few days after walking out since she said she wasn&#039;t going to get food stamps even though she makes 300 dollars a month has a 2 year old and another on the way in 3 months, because it isn&#039;t necessary and is embarrassing. This pissed me off so much I just wanted to tell her she is a selfish fool, but I don&#039;t raise my voice or cuss around her since she is sensitive and cussing is something she doesn&#039;t do or anybody in her family. I got up and walked out without saying a word.<br /><br />The next day I got cheesecake for myself and bought her two pieces anyways, because it is her favorite and left them on the front porch for her even though I was really angry about her immature attitude about not taking food stamps, so that our child can have nicer things instead of having us spend money on food and be left with not much else left over to spend on. <br /><br />To me that is love when you can still care and do nice things for a person you are so mad at you don&#039;t even want to speak to at the moment.

				Joy, I gave you a plus 1 for that. I agree a lot on that one. Nothing makes you feel less loved when you compromise, but never are reciprocated.<br /><br />I would enjoy hearing your philosophy on why compromising shows love.
