				Greed and selfishness are always around us. It seems they&#039;re an integral part to the human psyche and the survival of the fittest. But in my heart I know them to be hateful characteristics in any human being. I just can&#039;t find the logical argument that reasons it&#039;s better for an individual to not be greedy and selfish. Any thoughts...

				i belive greed to be nothing more than the concious evaluation of basic tribalism,one upmanship. the concept of whats mine is mine and whats yours is yours. a aspect of greed is fear, and its a fear of those without the money you have; of them actually having that money

				Playing devils advocate here, you could logically say;<br /><br />[1] To attain the greatest satisfaction from life, my goals would be best served by putting my own interests first, above anything or anyone. Those goals could include success, happiness, obtaining wealth, being comfortable, having a family to produce offspring.<br /><br />[2] It would also be in my interest to get the people around me &#039;on-side&#039;. The people who have the chance to effect my life in any way. To either have these people contribute to my success, or to limit any potential damage they may do to my cause. These people and me are on the same &#039;team&#039; (&#039;team&#039; could mean race, nationality, sex, geographic location, or any other factor people use to divide up the worlds population). The only reason to spend time or energy on these people is to forward my own cause.<br /><br />[3] Anyone who is not with me, is against me (and my &#039;team&#039;). These people are the common enemy and my be competing for the same resources. They must be overpowered, subdued, enslaved or eliminated (whichever best fits my purpose).<br /><br />We know there are people who use similar principles of greed and selfishness in their lives. You could argue that success in a world of &#039;Survival of the Fittest&#039; is dependent on following similar principles. But at what price? For however effective these greedy, selfish principles are, it&#039;s this kind of logic that could be used to rationalize all manner of awful acts, from racism, slavery and genocide (from point 3), to corruption and bribery (from points 1 &amp; 2).<br /><br />We know all this. But we still (at some level) live in a world of &#039;Survival of the Fittest&#039;. I just wish I knew a logical argument against the use of greed and selfishness. Maybe there isn&#039;t one, maybe the principles of greed and selfishness will always be the easy route to success. Even so, I&#039;m still going to live without them, even if it means more of a struggle to achieve my goals. The easy way is often the least rewarding one, if that makes me some kind of chump then so be it...

				I&#039;m no philosopher, but I believe every human is inclined to varying amounts of greed. <br /><br />The more one has,&nbsp; the more one wants.<br /><br />On the contrary, the less one has, the more fulfilled one gets when they receive something of value.<br /><br />Then again, humans are very odd and unique creatures...

				Greed is a virtue. Why would I subordinate something of greater value to me for something of lesser value? It would be irrational, and the only thing that makes people do it is guilt and slave morality. <br /><br />How about this example: If I owe my friend ten dollars it is greedy for me to pay him back because I value his trust more than the ten dollars so by paying him back I am pursuing what is in my own selfish interest.
