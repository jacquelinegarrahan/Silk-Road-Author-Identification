				I&#039;ve been searching and looking extensively for groups or people selling insider information for equities - but so far I&#039;ve only come across a limited number of Scandinavian stocks. I&#039;d be very interested in creating an organization aiming at getting this kind of info - either by extortion, hacking or bribery / payments.<br /><br />We could build such a network anonymously and ensure confidentiality to all participants via Tor and Bitcoins. With enough info we could easily trade without raising suspicion (or we could use services such as TorBroker - or even build our own broker-service).<br /><br />This network would have a front for guiding people how to use the service (both on and off Tor) - encouraging people within companies to give out information for cash, hackers to hack, torpedoes to extort, etc. The network would of course feature a back where all action and communication happens anonymously. The information would be ranked based on the reliability of the sources history, the more reliable a source becomes over time - the higher the payouts they get.<br /><br />What do you guys think? Inputs? Do you know of any existing anonymous groups doing something similar? Please let me know!&nbsp; 8)

If you can do this you will be safe. General tips: don&#039;t trade the same stock twice, hell don&#039;t even stick to the same sector, don&#039;t buy/sell at similar times, don&#039;t use similar entry methods for acquiring stock (or dumping at that), don&#039;t use the same account for multiple trades, throw regulatory agencies off by having a couple of losing trades (not over 70% should be winning trades), and finally be the only one who knows you did it (don&#039;t brag, be the first and last link between the info and your trades). <br /><br />I have also been interested in finding this information, but if it&#039;s out there and the quality of info is high, then it is going to be very hard-both exclusive and expensive- to acquire.

				You can mask such history by not only buying on insider info, but also based on technical and fundamental analysis. It would be impossible to find a pattern if you do it right. Only crazy people would go solely for buying companies they have insider info on. It would be like cheating at school and giving yourself the best grades in everything.<br /><br />Using this info to your benefit is simply to get better results - not amazingly &#039;impossible&#039; results that attracts everyones attention. A portfolio should consist of several companies, for instance, if you have six companies in the portfolio and two of these are based on insider info, then they would have to be pretty damn good to see some kind of pattern. It&#039;s only about having the upper hand, like casinos.

Thus bringing many more than just the SEC into finding out WTF is or went on. Think of the out cry from people on here that lose a few bucks while the bitcoin re-balances itself. Now, think of these old and new fuckers who don&#039;t like that 10&#039;s of millions and 100&#039;s of mils will be shifting to people that are not in the PROPER CIRCLES. A very LOUD SCREAM would be heard around the nation and depending on how much $ might be heard around the World..<br /><br />Old money has always stomped on New money, unless that new money pays, and pays the Correct people handsomely.. ;) JFFT

				You should read &quot;The Wolf on Wall Street&quot;. The SEC is under funded and lacks the man power/knowledge to persecute everyone. Just think if the American plutocrats gave the SEC more power....Rich people do not end up in American prisons unless, you really fuck up or piss someone off...How many executives were arrested from &quot;Too big to fail banks&quot; from the last economic debacle?

It would greatly be hinged on the amount of money that was profited and whom was in on it.<br /><br />You have to understand(which I certainly don&#039;t claim) the real players behind &#039;To Big To Fail&#039; as well this did become a National and to some degree Global economical disaster. However it was not routed in insider trading, as well there were far to many big players of the financial world that would not allow their cohorts to be persecuted by the Laws at that time. I believe these laws have been amended because of the late discovery of impending doom brought on by this Greed.<br /><br />Again, amount and players is the key. Never said it is impossible, just unlikely to be successful unless they are talking about a few million, but certainly under 10 is much more possible.<br />

				I&#039;m not talking about making billion dollar profits on a few deals - I&#039;m talking about consistently making stable profits over time. If the insider information you have is based on getting quarterly results a day ahead of release for instance, then of course you also buy companies you don&#039;t have this information on - a day before they release their results.<br /><br />How can they prove you have insider information when this is going through an anonymous network without any connection to your actual investments? They have to prove that you get this information from somewhere. I believe it would be quite hard to prove how you got the information as long as the users of the network are anonymous. They would have to investigate everyone buying in - simply because everyone could potentially be a member of set network and therefore also an insider trader.<br /><br />It would be like the police trying to pin a specific vendor to SR just because they intercepted a random letter with some drugs in it.
