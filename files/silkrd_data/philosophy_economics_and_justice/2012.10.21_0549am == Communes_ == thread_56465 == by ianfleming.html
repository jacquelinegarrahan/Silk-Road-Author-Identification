				What is the general consensus on communes?<br />I&#039;m thinking of visiting one for awhile.<br />However the (arguably horrible) movie Wanderlust has given me second thoughts.

				I dont think that such a ridiculous film should affect ones perception of communes as the oppinion presented in the film cannot be very accurate considering it is Hollywood.

				I have a friend who lives on a commune in the eastern part of America, no religious affiliations there. I spent a few months living/working there and i think it was a great experience. It surely isn&#039;t for everyone but if you want to know anything feel free to shoot me a message. But yea, what limitless said, back to the 60&#039;s for you. I think there are only 5 or 6 FEC (Federation of Egalitarian Communities) recognized communes in America, and that number might actually be smaller.

				I&#039;m not overly sure of that really.<br /><br />Communes often try to live independent of the rest of the world as best as they can. This involves growing your own food on the commune land and such.<br /><br />The downside is that as a westener this may not be all that positive an experience. Farming crops and animals for food is very labor intensive, and may seem to be pointless nowadays. In the real world the hard work is outsourced the the second and third world, for good reason. Working on the cattle feedstock production with cutting edge machinery may be okay, but if you want to resort to donkey-pulled ploughs and such it&#039;s an inefficient and probably msierable way to live.
