				Good afternoon all,<br /><br />So I&#039;m sitting here mid-roast preparation (the British Sunday kind not the Comedy Central kind..) and I wondered something that many people must have thought before - what if all the weed smokers of the country united and marched upon London? What if we all sparked up our torches of freedom in unison and bellowed out the smoke of a new era? <br /><br />Even if say 10% showed up what could the police possibly do? I wonder what the tipping point would be, how many people would such an action need in order to be effective?<br /><br />Best go check on the chicken now..have a good one!

				That sounds great and all..<br /><br /><br />But any kind of controversial gathering of that nature, is sure to have agent provocateurs ready to get the herd riled up, so the police can flex their muscles and ride in on their horses to &quot;stop the madness&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;

				Good idea - would love to see that happen&nbsp; :) ! Can you imagine the BBC News and papers oh they would just feed on something like that.<br />Most people in this country just accept what they&#039;re told to do - no complaints just do what the govt tell us, get so fed up.<br />So we&#039;ll be buying cigarettes in plain boxes because the fancy boxes encourage us to smoke... what the hell will they think up next?!

We were going somewhere? Fuck it. I&#039;m grabbing a snack. <br /><br />(cool idea, man. Just not going to happen--at least it&#039;s not going to be organized on SR [unless I&#039;ve much underestimated the numbers active on these forums]<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Snoopish

				There is 420 on April 20 in several 100 towns around the world<br />and then there is <br />World Cannabis Day somewhen early May.<br />Clearnet link: http://globalcannabismarch.com/<br />These are the biggest smoke-ins.<br />Typically for stoners there is no update for 2013 but to my best knowledge it is happening.
