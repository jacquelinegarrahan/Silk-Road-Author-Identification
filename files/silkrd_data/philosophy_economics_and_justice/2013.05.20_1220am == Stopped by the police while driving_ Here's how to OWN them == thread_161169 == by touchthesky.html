				I HATE it when people are harassed and stopped by the police. A lot of people I&#039;ve seen simply comply with whatever the officer is telling them like mindless zombies without asking any questions from their side. Sometimes I&#039;ve seen people start asking questions then get shut up by the police after they bark &quot;obstruction of an officer&quot; or &quot;yadee yaa act&quot;. <br /><br />If you are EVER stopped by a police officer. These are the questions you should ALWAYS have with you and you should ask relevant questions to your situation (you DONT go through them 1-28 like a jabbering moron). Once you start asking these questions, the Police know that you know what the fuck you&#039;re talking about and will let you go in most cases.<br /><br />If you&#039;d like further elaboration on any of the questions, or you try these and run into some problem post here. This will be a great help for me and the community in general<br /><br />Few general things:<br />You DONT have to have a drivers license<br />You DONT have to pay ANY speeding fine<br />You DONT have to pay ANY parking fine<br />You DONT have to present a cop with drivers license, insurance and rego papers first thing<br />You DONT have to waive your rights<br />You DONT have to be harassed<br />You DONT address the cop as &quot;Officer&quot;. Address him as &quot;Policy Enforcer&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot;. Police ARE Policy Enforcers. They don&#039;t enforce the law, despite many of them thinking they do. Police UPHOLD the Law and ENFORCE Government Policy a la Statues and Acts.<br />You DONT ever say you were &quot;driving&quot;, you say you were &quot;travelling&quot;<br />ALWAYS VIDEO RECORD YOUR RUN INS WITH THE POLICE. I suggest travelling in pairs so if one gets harassed the other can video record. The Police WILL try to get you to stop recording in many cases, but you can politely refuse or ask to see the law which says a Police Officer can&#039;t be recorded in a public place.<br />DONT roll your window ALL the way down. Simply crack down the window a little bit. If the cop tells you to wind it down all the way you politely decline, &quot;I&#039;m quite comfortable with this thanks, I can hear you fine&quot;<br />LOCK your doors when the police pull you over.<br />You DONT waive your rights, You DO tell them that you&#039;re waiving all benefits (these are the implied benefits police have e.g. if you&#039;re not stopping them from searching you then you&#039;re consenting to being searched)<br />You must always remember that exercising your right is NOT wrong at all. DO NOT doubt yourself NO MATTER WHAT the Police or anyone else may say. You getting stopped while traveling if you haven&#039;t done anything wrong (i.e. SPECIFICALLY HARM SOMEONE, driving 5km&#039;s over is not &quot;wrong&quot;) then you are being harassed and your right to travel without harassment is being violated.<br />You are NOT obligated to answer ANY of their questions or do ANYTHING they ask you to voluntarily.<br />If you are extracted from the car or anything else which is not voluntary, you DONT resist you simply keep saying &quot;I do not consent to this, I am acting under protest and duress&quot;<br />Every so often you should assert that you are a peaceful man who just wants to go about his private business. You are an upstanding citizen, have not breached the peace and do not know why you&#039;re being stopped and would like to be free on your way<br />You NEVER, EVER, EVERRRRRR say the words &quot;I understand&quot;. That means &quot;I stand under your statements&quot; in law terms, you&#039;re waiving your rights. If the police say anything and end it with &quot;do you understand&quot;, your reply should be &quot;I heard you officer but I don&#039;t stand under any statements you make&quot;<br /><br />1.) What seems to be the problem POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM?<br />2.)&nbsp; POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, is it true that you are wearing a hidden microphone on your person and that you are recording everything that I say?<br />3.)POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, is it true that if I ask you to write down every question that I am going to ask you, that you are required to write it down on your narrative report?<br />4.)

POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM Under what authority are you acting?<br />6.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, Is this a transaction of security interest? If not, you will not be generating any obligation upon me to pay or perform so there is no reason for us to be talking. If this is a security interest transaction, then you need my consent for that and I do not give my consent to your transaction of security interest.<br />7.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, In regards to my drivers license, registration and insurance: Are you willing to to claim under full commercial liability that I have an obligation to have such a thing to exercise my common law right?<br />8.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, do you know that a &quot;driver&quot; is defined as &quot;one EMPLOYED in conducting a coach, carriage or other vehicle&quot;, Boviers Law Dictionary, 1914 edition, Page 94<br />9.)

POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, do you know that, where a private statue exists of which intent&nbsp; is regulation of commercial common carriers, the particular agency enforcing the private statue, shall not apply it by trickery and deceit, to persons who are not noticed by the statues as the persons regulated and taxed, nor should it permit any party to do so in violation of a persons right to stay out of compelled license/contract, when he is not a person subject to the statue, unless clearly stated in words<br />15.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, do you know that where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them?<br />16.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, do you know that, the assertion of Federal right, when plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local practice?<br />17.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, do you know that statues that violate the plain and obvious principles of common right and common reason are null and void?<br />18.)POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, do you know that the state cannot diminish the rights of the people?<br />19.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM, do you know that an individual may stand upon his Constitutional right as a Citizen. He is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way. His power to contract is unlimited. He owes no duty to the state or to his neighbours to divulge his business, or to open his door to an investigation, so far is it may tend to incriminate him. He owes no such duty to the state, since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of life and property. His rights are such as existed by law of the land long antecedent to the organisation of the state. He owes nothing to the public so long as he doesn&#039;t trespass upon their rights?<br />20.) POLICY ENFORCER/SIR/MADAM do you know that the right to travel upon highways is a Constitutional right? Do you know that the use of highways for the purpose of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common and fundamental right of which the public and the individual cannot be rightfully deprived?<br />21.)

				yes it pisses them off, because they realise you know your rights. If they keep yapping on you simply demand they call their supervisor. They&#039;ll always say &quot;sir you could&#039;ve ended this a long time ago by just doing what you were told to do&quot;.<br /><br />Freedom has its prices, and you may be there a little bit longer than intended but you get out knowing that you &quot;fucked&quot; with a police officer as much as they &quot;fuck&quot; with the rest of the general public.

If you do, you&#039;re lucky, if you don&#039;t, consider lying and saying you do. Go right to their superior at the police station as soon as you can, file a complaint and ask to speak with their superior. If that fails go to a diff dept. for example state trooper harasses you and his superior doesn&#039;t hear you out, go to local sheriff or vice versa.<br /><br />RECORD EVERYTHING <br /><br /><br /><br />

				I&#039;ve seen too many pull older cars over with more than 3 people in it cause they think drugs might be inolved. I&#039;ve seen my mate get harassed too many times simply because his skyline has the R bade on it after GT. You know sometimes they pull you over for bullshit reasons.<br /><br />My girlfriend got a $250 fine because she was driving while talking on the phone to me (my call was on speaker but she just held her end close to her mouth because she was driving and there was a lot of noise. They pull you over and give you random citations, signs. This is the order in which I&#039;ve seen Police go down<br /><br />1.) Pull over<br />2.) License and registration<br />3.) Alcohol breathaliser<br /><br />if no alcohol and no previous record on your license its your luck weather they let you go or not. I had one cop pull me over go through this order except after everything came negative he went back to his car for 15 minutes. Came back issued me a $200 fine and 3 demerit points for not waiting 3 seconds at a stop sign......there was a railway track that was down because a train was passing AND a car in front of me which stopped AND I stopped for a second or two. They still thought it wasn&#039;t good enough. Needless to say they didn&#039;t get the money they were after from me<br /><br />Police have a BUDGET. They give fines to meet their BUDGET. They put speeding cameras in places which have the most traffic passing through to increase the chances of speeding fines to meet their WEEKLY TARGET.<br /><br />and Jack. Do you know that in fact Police are Policy Enforcers? A lot of them has the misconception they are Law Enforcers. They&#039;re not.<br /><br />Police UPHOLD the law and ENFORCE government policy a la statues<br /><br />And they are bound by their laws and their oath. Think about it. If they weren&#039;t and they could search ANY car. They would just pull you over, break your car window, extract you from the car, pin you to the ground, rip your car open and then leave. They can&#039;t do that. What do they do? &quot;Sir can you please step out of the car&quot;, &quot;You don&#039;t mind if I have a look inside do you&quot;, &quot;Why would you not wanting me looking inside if you haven&#039;t done anything wrong&quot;<br /><br />The last one especially. I see Scout has a similar thinking. I&#039;m not saying you&#039;re wrong Scout, everyone is entitled to their opinion but to say that if you&#039;re not doing anything bad you should just be complying with police officers is basically saying &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; and is the reason the Police are drunk with power. Why should a Police Officer be suspicious if you know your rights and refuse to let them harass you? But they are. Because even their training says has the &quot;guilty till proven innocent&quot; undertone.<br /><br />Not ALL cops are bad. But corruption is deep, far and wide in the Police Force

Common Law and Criminal Law. Unless I have committed a crime for which you have proof, you have no right to interrupt my right to travel. Period.

				I see where your going with this and I&#039;m all for Row Row Fighting the Power, but at the same time the phrase &quot;asking for it&quot; springs to mind.<br /><br />They can still find a way to make your life worse if you come across as a straight smart ass.<br /><br />Here you might not get the initial fine but your 750% more likely to leave that traffic stop with a vehicle that is now &quot;unroadworthy&quot; and must be assessed.<br /><br />Parts of what you encourage here is probably spot on, but as for me, I will be picking my battles and a $50 speeding fine isn&#039;t always one of them

				if they do then they are acting under personal prejudice. If you have recorded the encounter and shit like this happens you can file a complaint against them.<br /><br />They will harass you no doubt, because they don&#039;t want the people rising up, so they do everything they can to suppress you. But it&#039;s about your willpower. I&#039;m sure they&#039;d get into deeper shit randomly declaring a car &quot;unroadworthy&quot; without inspection. I&#039;d demand proof. There is always a way around bullshit that Police pulls<br /><br />Again I ask those to all that have said it. How is knowing your rights, and not allowing Police to harass you, &quot;asking for it&quot;. You think lawyers here go around paying these stupid fines and letting Police search their cars? Are all lawyers &quot;asking for it&quot;? Does knowing the law and your rights, protecting them and not waiving them simply mean you&#039;re &quot;asking for it&quot;? That&#039;s very single minded thinking. &quot;Do as Jesus tells you in the Bible or you go to Hell&quot;. Fuck off (to the jesus thing not anyones opinion on the matter, I&#039;m more than happy for an open discussion)<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161169.msg1145674#msg1145674">Quote from: Tellemetree on May 20, 2013, 01:37 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Parts of what you encourage here is probably spot on, but as for me, I will be picking my battles and a $50 speeding fine isn&#039;t always one of them<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why shouldn&#039;t it be? How many of those fines have you paid up until now and how many would continue to come in the future? Anytime I get a mail asking to pay a fine. I return to sender with FRAUD written nicely across the back of the letter. Got a court summon two times. Showed up once, said it was a &quot;special appearance&quot;. Stayed 5 minutes from the moment I started my case (defending myself of course, fuck an attorney for these petty matters) to get the case dismissed. Never showed up to the other. No warrants in my name. Suck my dick Police.<br /><br />Also interesting is that you&#039;re not obligated to show up to court when proceedings for one of these fines takes place. The time I did go was to prove to a friend how ridiculous it was. I went to the magistrates court a few days before to get a copy of the record of the complaint. Provided the number, lo and behold they haven&#039;t even filed anything with the Magistrates office, recorded that, had 5 people with me. Showed up on the day of the hearing. Lo and Behold, a record is there which pre-dates the day I came to check on my complaint with 5 witnesses and a video recording. Needless to say the judge merely called my case up to look at the evidence I filed prior to my hearing, including my motion to dismiss. Tried to get me to enter a plea, failed and simply hammered, &quot;case dismissed&quot;<br /><br />They abuse the system.

The main point is to have the questions with you and ask the ones which are relevant. If I wanted people to be disrespectful towards them I would have written &quot;Fucking Pig&quot; at the start of every question.<br /><br />Again I ask you, why would a Police person take offense to being called a Policy Enforcer?, say if your real name was Jim but instead of saying &quot;hey Jim&quot; they said &quot;Hey Man&quot;, or your brother said &quot;Hey Bro&quot;, would you get offended? No police officer I have met has been offended by this, and I&#039;m sure any sane clear level-headed police officer won&#039;t be taking offense to this. Like I said they do enforce policy, that&#039;s their job.<br /><br />And again, I will say, if they treat you differently by you asking these questions, then they are acting under prejudice. That is why true revolutions are few and far between now.<br /><br />I think the story of Rosa Parks is a great example here, every black person KNEW that they weren&#039;t ALLOWED to sit in the front of the bus, heck it was considered law (like a lot of things now are &quot;considered&quot; law). Why do I say Rosa Parks? Despite what many people believe she WASNT the first one to refuse, people before her had refused and gone to jail for it (that makes it law right?). But she refused, went through hardships and battled her way through the court system. That&#039;s what I mean by they&#039;ll try to tear you down as much as they can, but in the end true justice will always prevail if you keep fighting for it. I believe she&#039;s known as &quot;the first lady of civil rights&quot; and &quot;the mother of freedom&quot;

I went to jail because I did, in the cops own words, &quot;a California roll&quot; at a stop sign and turns out I had a warrant out for my arrest for failing to appear in court for getting a ticket for parking the wrong way on the street in front of my house. I literally went to jail because I parked in the wrong direction in front of my house. A few months later I was working a night job delivering Chinese food and I delivered to this house in the ghetto and parked facing a parking lot with a bunch of cop cars. When I delivered the food the customer even asked &quot;What are all those cops doing over there?&quot; &quot;I don&#039;t, probably spoiling someone&#039;s night.&quot; I joked. After I pulled out, the cops pulled out of the parking lot, got behind me, pulled me over for my car not having a bumper. There were 6 different cars too. They asked why I was &quot;watching them&quot; back in that parking lot and I explained I was just doing my job and just parked there by coincidence. They then told me they were in the middle of a drug bust and thought I was the get away car, search my vehicle, tour apart my car, opened the other order I had and went through the food looking for drugs. I didn&#039;t have insurance at the time because I JUST starting working this job after being unemployed for a couple months so I haven&#039;t renewed my insurance and they threatened to impound my car. I was so shaken and confused and hysterical at the time I told them if they got the word to impound my vehicle I&#039;d start swinging and until they shoot me in the head. After that they told me that &quot;We&#039;re going to leave but if we come back and this vehicle happens to be gone then we aren&#039;t liable for that. But we can&#039;t let you drive it.&quot; So they let me go, but I was an hour late to deliver the order, got suspending from my job for not having insurance and being late on the order. I was pissed to say the least. Thankful they let me go, but angry because I felt like I was getting picked on because I&#039;m too poor to afford a nice car.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fuck the police. That&#039;s what I say.&nbsp; These are like, 2 of a dozen or show similar &quot;wrong place, wrong time, prick cop&quot; stories I have too.

				I&#039;m right with you man, all these damn cops think they can make me do whatever the hell I want.<br /><br />I&#039;m 19 and I always carry a handgun in my truck (legal in my state)<br /><br />Most cops that pull me over try to tell me it&#039;s against the law blah blah blah, then I inform them of my rights and I give them the specific law that states I am allowed to carry a handgun and they usually just let me go. I&#039;ve had to request a supervisor once, but he went back to his car and came back and said he spoke with his supervisor and that I was right and I was &#039;free to go&#039;. BITCH I WAS BORN FREE <br /><br />Anyways, I like to pull the, &quot;sir, didn&#039;t you swear an oath the uphold the constitution?&quot; &quot;then enforcing this unjust law that goes against the constitution breaks that oath...&quot; <br /><br />I used to always comply to mostly everything they asked, mainly because when I used to smoke pot I always had some on me and I was not looking for a court summons, or a possession with intent to distribute charge. <br /><br />Awesome thread though man! I always tell people that if cops are here to protect us, why are you scared of them.<br /><br />And they like to say, I&#039;m just following orders.... The Nazi&#039;s were just following orders.

				great feedback guys. keep em coming. hopefully through more stories we can see how corrupt the Police Force is around the world.<br /><br />I think we all know what happens with a big drug bust. Yeah sure, they might record the raid and their findings and do everything &quot;officially&quot; but you know what happens afters its &quot;bagged and tagged&quot; and taken into evidence? I&#039;ll give you an example with Meth in Aus<br /><br />There was a HUGE seizure of Ice in WA a while back. Supply dented for a few people. People not happy. Trying to chase whatever link they can to secure a source. Shootouts. Bikies. So what do the cops do? They take the ice they confiscated. Re-crystallize to change the colour. Sold Pink Crystals and Blue Crystals to dealers just so they could see who are the people making the big purchases. <br /><br />But it&#039;s &quot;unofficial&quot; sales and its in cash......hey.....who&#039;s going to ask questions? might as well give it as a gift to the narcotics unit or keep for some black ops (as in actual black operations not COD Black Ops although who knows they recruit a lot of young people to taint them from their teens)<br /><br />It&#039;s funny to me how you step out of the car while the whole time holding your hands in front of the steering wheel and the officers still going to &quot;frisk&quot; you for officer safety. I&#039;d like to see how they react some guy pulls them over while driving, points a gun, orders them around, tells em to get out, frisks them etc<br /><br />A lot of cops thesedays even refuse to have their 3 pieces of I.D on them. They refuse to give it. Do they not realise they are public SERVANTS? if they do not give ID, even if its a Police car, you do not have to even listen to any &quot;lawful orders&quot; they might give; for all you know they could have killed a copper, stolen his car and pulled you over to steal your car now.<br /><br />ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ASK A COPPER FOR THEIR 3 PIECES OF ID. <br />Badge<br />Warrant/ID card<br />Business card<br /><br />they are OBLIGATED to give these out at the request of the public. See the thing, they&#039;re OBLIGATED, we&#039;re not but somehow they&#039;ve flipped it around?

				I want to add something.<br /><br />I got a letter from the district attorney, that I was caught stealing copper in a house at a particular street.<br />I traced the date back and indeed someone with the same age was caught stealing copper and detained at the policestation.<br /><br />When I paid 180 euro&#039;s , the case should not become before a court of law.<br />I was never in the neighborhood, let alone in the house and I do not steal, NEVER !!<br /><br />The district attorney is hard to reach, no address, no email, so I could not react to say he had the wrong person.<br /><br />The second letter came, and now he threatened me to pay 70 euro or else I would face the judge.<br />He did not want 180 euro anymore but 70 euro was enough<br /><br />I may hope that the copper the thief stole is confiscated, I am sure it carry&#039;s not my DNA or fingerprints.<br />But our police is stupid enough to lose the evidence.<br />Not that they gave it back tio the thief, just to make it impossible to retrieve DNA or fingerprints from it.<br />So I did not react to his letter and am waiting for a date when it will become before court.<br /><br />If I Stole something I would know. Police asks questions etc. Non of such things happened to me.<br />I didn&#039;t read anything, never went to a police-station, not even for 10 minutes.<br /><br />I am sure I will get a letter again where they inform me that I do not have to face the judge, because they have not the tiniest bit of evidence.<br />Pay to prevent to go to a court of law?<br />Never!<br />I did not do it.<br /><br />The thing is, that there was someone with my age cought stealing copper, caught on the act in a house at a street where there are no houses.<br /><br />I want to see evidence.<br />When caught, you will have a conversation with a cop and sign a paper , right? <br />I have a bead memory, but I am sure the police confuses me with someone else.<br />The guy from the newspaper, that had been caught.<br />But that guy was not me.<br /><br />I am only once convicted to jail, because I possessed a perfecta fbi 8000.<br />I said it was not a real gun, just for blanks.<br />Every sports-ware-shop sell those guns.<br /><br />The police did not believe me.<br /><br />Things turned nasty, so I told the police to keep my mouth shut.<br />So I was put outside on the smoking-place every police-station has.<br /><br />The sun was shining and I wanted just a quick smoke from a cigarette.<br />This was about 09.00 am.<br /><br />At 03.30 I as still outside in my t-shirt and the temperature was -8 degrees.<br />No food, no water, almost 19 hours in subzero temperatures.<br /><br />At my cell I got a paper-cup of water, where I still could see the powder turning.<br />So I trowed the water in his face.<br />He said wait till tomorrow when you shit in your pens and don&#039;t you dare to go to the newspaper.<br />We have our story ready.<br />You are the one who thinks the police here is the same as in south America.<br /><br />I saw the powder still turning, the policeman said something about south america and still I had not have the slightest idea I was poisoned<br />The next day I had to go to the toilet. but the toilet could cope with my load of shit.<br /><br />Now it became clear to me...the words &quot;&quot;tomorrow you will shit in your pens&quot;&quot;, that the policeman did nothing when I trowed the water at him.<br /><br />This was in the 1980&#039;s. After 3 days at the policestation I got a laywer.<br />I told him the store where I bought the fake gun.<br />I did not go to court, because the gun was not fireweapon and harmless and was sold in every town.<br /><br />I was send to jail anyway.<br />I called my lawyer that I wanted a appeal.<br />He forgot , so I found out 3 months later.<br /><br />But There are no fire-weapons from the brand &quot;&quot;Perfecta&quot;&quot; and the fbi8000 can not shoot bullets, how can I go to jail fro a item sold in every sport-ware-store.<br /><br />When I was out of jail I wanted to make a case of it and go to the newspapers.<br />So an other attorney asked for my criminal record. <br /><br />The 2 weeks I had served were disappeared.<br />I never went to court, was never convicted and did no jail-time.<br /><br />Fucking cunts!<br /><br />In an other case I attacked 6 police-officers.<br />One on each arm, one on each leg, on behind me put his arm around my neck and one police-man punched me with force between my nose and chin.<br />You guessed it probably ...I went to jail for 30 day because I toke a bite in policeman nr6 in his hand.<br /><br />I have it black on white from a department of the police who controls and keeps a eye on the police.<br />I told them what it meant to be held tight and firm on every limb and a police-officer claiming to have seen that I was beaten on my mouth.<br />The policeman who was honest and told about the amounts of blood coming from my mouth did not count because all other policeman declared different.<br /><br />30 days to jail-time because one policeman beat two and a half teeth out of my mouth.<br />The policeman who told the truth is no longer working there.<br />Trying to give his colleges a bad name or worse.<br /><br />Justice in the Netherlands !!<br /><br />Punched me in my stomach so my food came out<br />Went to the police-station for 4 days, went back with a lawyer.<br />&quot;&quot;No sir, I am reading all that happened and who were here the last days, but your client has never been here&quot;&quot;<br /><br />When you never was at the police-station, you can not do anything.<br />I said I had my food, my one hour of fresh air, so there have to be some paperwork.<br />There was non<br /><br />And I am a non stealing law biting citizen, who pays taxes for their salary.<br /><br />Am I glad , That I am no criminal.<br />At least I came out of the police-station (Where according to the police I never have been)<br />To every criminal in the Netherlands, I hope you will go to jail.<br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I meant at least you didn&#039;t disappear mysteriously.<br /><br />Police are fucking cunts!<br />And every police-officer who sees things that are against the law, but are afraid to say something to their superior or afraid to put a note in the wissle-blower-box is a fucking cunt just the same.<br /><br />Love and peace and I hate those who hate.<br /><br />You know the Dutch police has a slogan? It goes like this;<br /><br />The police is your best friend<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Who needs enemy&#039;s with such friends?<br /><br />Fucking cunts!<br /><br />

				While a lot of them are correct, Do you also realize that all a police officer has to do is this, and none or most of the above dont apply, especially the ones about not consenting to searches etc.<br /><br />All they have to do is pull you over, Say they smell marijuana even if they dont and they are instantly allowed to perform a drug search. I have persnally been stopped, Said a few of the above, Asked for a supervisor who was called, And they said, &quot;sir, i apologize in advance if this is a hassle for you, However this officer has smelled marijuana and is now allowed to perform a drug search under whatever law he quoted&quot;, He also produced a copy of the law in question as proof of this.&nbsp; <br /><br />On top of this if you start all the questions and crap, It triggers any cops suspicions, Thye either think your some idiot who just watched&nbsp; youtube video, or read some legal shit on a forum and thinks he knows everything, In which case they decide they want to fuck you every way possible. Or that you may know your shit but ae hiding something hence their suspicions are raised majorly. You will get the Sir if you will just allow me to quickly search your vehicle you can be on your way in less than 2 minutes if you have nothing to hide. Now this is technically pressuring you into consenting, However i have noted from personal experience, If you have a really good stash then it&#039;s sometimes better to just allow them to do it, Act very friendly and even talk to them as they are searching it, Try and distract them (very subtlety of course) And the search is Almost Always 95% of the time a lot less thorough. If they think you have nothing to hide it is a lot easier. <br /><br />You have rights yes, But using some of them should be a very last resort. The best thing is to act friendly, Consent to a search AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A GOOD STASH, if things start getting out of control say something like &quot;Sir, I realize you are only doing your job, but i have a doctors appointment i need to be at immediately and this is starting to invade on my personal time, which may effect my health&quot; <br /><br />Now they will usually say &quot; sir if you just let me do my job it will be over a lot faster&quot; Shit like this, You say &quot;sir i allowed you to search my vehicle in good faith, you are now abusing your powers as a law enforcement officer and then quote the bit above about the oath they took as an officer. <br /><br />Now dont get me wrong if you have 2 kilos in your car, Maybe you want to go a different route, but it is all up to you.

				Yeah man. I had a similar experience with the dutch police.<br /><br />Got mistaken for some one else because I was wearing a black hat. And the guy that reported some one had he had a knife (he lied). When I saw the police coming at he I reach to my breast pocket to get my ID. Because that is always what the want to see<br />Then the police with out any warning started attacking me and my friend. I though they just wanted to beat me up. So I resisted then locked up in jail for 3 days. And when later I was found innocent but still got a fain of 200 euro a criminal record for resting arrest. And 2 years probation.<br />But the most insulting thing was that I had I bottle of Surinami sambal saus and they opened the bottle and toke a little taste. And bragged about it so loud that I could hear it.<br />&nbsp;<br />The dutch police like all LE are bunch off assholes

				Jesus you people are crazy, maybe shit is different in Oz, but you DO NOT FUCK with the police. The power balance is totally against you. ie they have all the power and you have NONE. Maybe not none legally, but NONE practically, they have a thousand different ways they can fuck with you, they know it, and they are good at it. &quot;Yes Sir, No Sir, how high would you like me to jump sir&quot; is the only rational response when confronted with that kind of power imbalance, especially if you are a criminal. Now maybe if i was an upstanding member of society i would enforce my rights, but lets face it, you are on SR, you are not an upstanding member of society, no matter what you think.<br /><br />It may be your right to drive a nissan GTR, but if you are a criminal driving one, i&#039;m sorry, but you are a fucking idiot. Drive a camry for fucks sake. Obviously if arrested never say anything without a lawyer, but pissing off the police is just plain stupid, here in Oz, i know for a fact, that they will fuck your shit up. Nobody likes a smart ass, police have ways of dealing with them. I always dress conservative, drive a late model boring car with no dings, warrants etc, am extremely polite to all government employees, and generally present myself as a boring, shy nerd. And i have been getting away with this shit for a very very long time. You CANNOT &quot;own&quot; the police, only they can own you.

				I&#039;ve never had a problem with them, and I&#039;ve had &quot;run-ins&quot; many times.&nbsp; I actually think an honorable police officer is one of the best people in my society.&nbsp; It depends on the country, but where I live most just want to do their job, which is enforcing laws which society deems are needed to protect the public at large.&nbsp; It can be a pain to have them give you trouble via a law that you don&#039;t think is right, but I think that&#039;s pretty much a matter of &quot;hating the messenger&quot;.&nbsp; Now there can be some asshole cops, or cops that are being assholes that day, but regardless...<br /><br />I would recommend being respectful and to-the-point with officers, while also knowing your rights.&nbsp; Let them do their job without a hassle and leave.<br /><br />If you get a cop that is on a &quot;power trip&quot;, the last thing I&#039;d recommend is being confrontational (outside of reasonably asserting your rights) or disrespectful to them.<br /><br />-PB

The power balance is totally against you. ie they have all the power and you have NONE. Maybe not none legally, but NONE practically, they have a thousand different ways they can fuck with you, they know it, and they are good at it. &quot;Yes Sir, No Sir, how high would you like me to jump sir&quot; is the only rational response when confronted with that kind of power imbalance, especially if you are a criminal. Now maybe if i was an upstanding member of society i would enforce my rights, but lets face it, you are on SR, you are not an upstanding member of society, no matter what you think.<br /><br />It may be your right to drive a nissan GTR, but if you are a criminal driving one, i&#039;m sorry, but you are a fucking idiot. Drive a camry for fucks sake. Obviously if arrested never say anything without a lawyer, but pissing off the police is just plain stupid, here in Oz, i know for a fact, that they will fuck your shit up. Nobody likes a smart ass, police have ways of dealing with them. I always dress conservative, drive a late model boring car with no dings, warrants etc, am extremely polite to all government employees, and generally present myself as a boring, shy nerd. And i have been getting away with this shit for a very very long time. You CANNOT &quot;own&quot; the police, only they can own you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=161169.msg1184527#msg1184527">Quote from: DoctorFate on May 31, 2013, 08:58 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Can we change the title of this post to something more like &quot;How to get arrested on the spot&quot;?<br /><br />If for whatever reason you get stopped by a police officer, be polite, respectful, courteous and above all act like you recognize their authority, even if you don&#039;t.&nbsp; If you don&#039;t act like a total scumbag they will just get their power trip on and let you off.<br /><br />1 thing goes through my mind when I&#039;m sitting on the side of the road with those stupid blue and red lights in my rear view mirror, &quot;I just want this over as soon as possible&quot;.&nbsp; So I put on a smile, sound as accommodating as possible, end every sentence with sir and an apology. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is very smart Doctorfate and&nbsp; AustralianHash this is exactly what I do, I let them know(think) there in charge and I respect that fact. anything that keeps them from finding out that Im a full of shit con man with Drugs hidden somewhere and rockin a buzz at the same time.

				Agreed suck up to them (but not too obviously).<br /><br />Do not do anything to draw attention.<br /><br />If they try to arrest you, grab their gun and shoot them dead!

				Honestly, there&#039;s only a handful of things you need to know, almost universally, about the pigs<br /><br />1.&nbsp; They&#039;re not all pigs.&nbsp; Sure, the profession attracts bullies, but if you&#039;ve ever been bullied before it&#039;s easy enough to spot those ones.<br />2.&nbsp; Don&#039;t say &quot;I&#039;m sorry&quot; unless you truly believe what you&#039;ve said/done was inappropriate.&nbsp; This really only applies to bully-cops.&nbsp; They take &quot;sorry&quot; as a sign of weakness.&nbsp; <br />3.&nbsp; Don&#039;t give a big schpeel and don&#039;t act submissive.&nbsp; Stay neutral and find a way to get on the copper&#039;s good side.&nbsp; If no good side can be found, then defer to your rights.<br />4.&nbsp; You (should) understand your rights, and so should the cop.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to remind him of that unless he&#039;s taking a clear step against them.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be pompous about knowing your rights.&nbsp; They exist, they&#039;re mostly understood, forget about them unless you need to bring them up.<br />5.&nbsp; They are not a judge.&nbsp; Don&#039;t try and plead innocence while they&#039;re writing you up.<br />6.&nbsp; They&#039;re not all pigs.&nbsp; I think I said this, but really, they&#039;re probably just another working stiff who got stuck on traffic duty.&nbsp; It&#039;s their job.&nbsp; If you can talk or schmooze your way out of a ticket, fantastic!&nbsp; But don&#039;t take it out on Officer Joe Schmo (who, like most working stiffs, would really rather be fishing right now).<br /><br />It&#039;s not an &quot;us against them&quot; thing unless it comes down to something fundamental, like the desire for a truly free market.&nbsp; Otherwise, just buck up and pay the damn fine and be glad you weren&#039;t caught with any of SR&#039;s finest freakeries.<br /><br />Following OP&#039;s advice, however, is an easy way to get yourself in a lose-lose situation.<br /><br />Cheers and Be Safe,<br />~Ali &lt;3

				Fuck OP&#039;s Guide. Whenever I get pulled over, I simply address them as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma&#039;am&quot;. If they ask what I&#039;m doing, I simply say&quot; I&#039;m driving&quot;. If they ask why am I being pulled over, I say &quot;I don&#039;t know Sir/Ma&#039;am&quot;. If they keep asking,&nbsp; with no attitude, no emotion, just cold answers, continue to say &quot;I&#039;m just driving&quot;.&nbsp; You are dealing with Law enforcement here, aka Cold-blooded Sharks, treat them as such. Usually at this point, they&#039;ll ask for ID/registration or try to trick you into friendly banter. Show them ur ID/registration but don&#039;t get buddy/buddy with them. They&#039;re just fishing for ANYTHING to give you a ticket or trick you into leaving your vehicle and giving up for rights. I&#039;ve been dealing with cops, MP&#039;s, and highway patrol like this for years and it has always worked. Don&#039;t let cocksuckers like them intimidate you. Their workers just like everyone else and wouldn&#039;t take a bullet in the the head for you, but they&#039;ll definitely put on in yours. Don&#039;t play their game or think you can &quot;out-lawyer&quot; them because you saw it work on youtube. Limit contact and be on your way.

				I like the guide. You gotta play it by ear. A nice guy pulls you over and is polite and chill? Be cool with him. I had a cop telling me that &quot;I KNOW YOU HAVE WEED IN THE CAR I SEE IT IN THE GLASS JAR IN YOUR TRUNK&quot; <br /><br />He&#039;s said &quot;You&#039;re an idiot I&#039;m calling another officer and I&#039;m going to search your car.&quot; I told him &quot;No, I will give you the jar though and show you nothing is in it.&quot; and I did and he was like &quot;ughh get back in your fucking car&quot; and I got a speeding ticket. Fuck that, man I would&#039;ve used all that law jargon on his ass if I knew it cuz I knew I was getting a ticket anyway lol<br /><br />but yeah he had no right to search my car yet he was telling me he was going to. For what, he sees a glass mason jar in my trunk?? That&#039;s not paraphernalia. He also saw a bag in the passenger&#039;s side door which I keep filled with first aid supplies. He&#039;s shining his light stick around asking &quot;WHAT&#039;S THAT?! OK WELL WHAT&#039;S THAT?!&quot; So fucking annoying.
