				swazi offers grams for 3-8 bucks pending on whether it&#039;s high mids or hash. I&#039;ve heard of pounds being sold very cheap; no such person exists on silk road? Someone who has such connects and is on board with the escrow system?<br /><br />Lo&#039;s, Mid&#039;s, High&#039;s, Hash; <br /><br />I am also interested in coke, molly, xanax, vicodin, hulicigens, DMT. &amp; any other party drug beach folk would enjoy.<br /><br />

				There are two problems, both of which can be circumvented by somebody with imagination and capital.<br /><br />1. Many developing countries have ready access to product, but they cannot arbitrage this ability so quickly because:<br /><br />A: Internet access is limited or strictly controlled.<br />B: The postal system... is pretty corrupt.<br /><br />2. Later on, once you have lots of product coming through, you got kiboshed by the red flag system at customs. Naturally you&#039;re shipping from the cheapest to the most expensive jurisdictions, so any post from an African or South American country is in a tiny pool, making interception very very easy.<br /><br />--<br /><br />I did say that this could be circumvented by people of imagination and capital. The solution is to create tag teams and transship.<br /><br />Let&#039;s call the tag team, Alice and Bob, for the sake of cryptoanarchic tradition.<br /><br />If you have a Bob in Swazi, you give him a sat connection. Then Bob has a special staging depot with which he packages product, bought off the happy natives (at a premium to ensure loyalty and any &#039;heads-ups&#039;). Bob will require serious protection, because Bob will eventually become a well known go-to guy.<br /><br />Bob uses private courier to send the product to a country which is &quot;neutral&quot;. A neutral country is one which where large amounts of trade/post between Bob&#039;s country and it exist.<br /><br />You may have to chain two or three &quot;neturals&quot; to make this swarming technique work (you&#039;re aiming for getting into the legit postal system ASAP, because private couriers are expensive). Eventually the product arrives at Alice&#039;s country having been transhipped here and there. Alice then retails on SR from here, a western developed domicile, receiving each shipment at separate disposable virtual offices. Then you arbitrage the difference between prices, in many cases this is &gt; 10,000% profit. No matter your P&amp;P, security costs, all that will fade into insignificance after the first couple of shots.<br /><br />This is an ancient capitalist technique, and it works, but it requires capital/imagination and some risk. Still, you can become rich fast this way. I&#039;d do it right now, but I don&#039;t have the right partner.<br /><br />The Silk Road. Putting the Transnational in TCO! :)<br /><br />Note: This technique works best of all with diaspora esp. from a security point of view.<br />
