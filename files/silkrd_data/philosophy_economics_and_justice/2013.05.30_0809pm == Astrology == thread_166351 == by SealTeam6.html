AlfalfaBillMurray has read Wikipedia and everyone else is wrong.<br /><br />Lmao.<br /><br />Really though, if you reach a little farther than Wikipedia, there is a TON of &quot;facts&quot; concerning Astrology, much of it to be found in the understandings of ancient civilizations and so on. When you take into account their very accurate knowledge of celestial bodies (without the use of telescopes .. or anything we know of), then what they believed about those celestial bodies must be taken with some merit as well. They were obviously privy to something we are not. This kind of information itself could be considered &#039;fact&#039;, but there is still more tangible measurements which can be made. For example, the now highly publicized (and wrongly defined) &quot;2012 shift&quot; is a very real and measurable thing that is happening to our planet and our solar system as we speak, and the &quot;2012 shift&quot; in an Astrological event.<br /><br />I came across some information I thought resonates quite well. It says that; the idea with Astrology is to describe the movement of energies relative to each other. I&#039;m no expert on the stuff, but for example, certain planets, stars, systems, etc. represent certain qualities, ideas or energies (for whatever reasons, determined long ago by methods unknown and carried on through tradition and myth). At any given time there is a unique celestial situation taking place. Planets and the energies they represent may be may be far away, or close together, and either coming together or moving farther apart as the cycles spin.<br /><br />The idea of your &quot;horoscope&quot; simply represents a snapshot of our solar system at the moment you were born. The horoscope is supposed to be a reference point, to help you understand the things you came here to do as a human by studying the specific energies in place when you were born. &quot;The way things were moving&quot; at that time, is an indication of the direction you were trying to take in life. For the people who care to look into it a bit deeper, if you approach it from this broader esoteric sense, and not the daily horoscope section, I guarantee you will find correlations with your own life when you begin to familiarize yourself with the specifics of your star sign. There are also transition periods between two signs, called &quot;cusps&quot; which are not addressed by newspaper horoscopes or 21st century horoscopes at all.<br /><br />Just to clarify, I think that Astrology is like any other ancient teaching which has survived to this day. What we have today is but a remnant and a scrap of the true scope of the information, but the keen will be able to peer between the lines and uncover deeper meaning in the teachings. Newspaper horoscopes are complete bollocks, because a &#039;real horoscope&#039; is not that cut and dry. There is literally a different horoscope for every single day that has ever passed, and no two horoscopes are the same. If we multiply 30 days in the month by 100 (100 year lifespan of a human) there is approx. 3000 different horoscopes going on that month, which is why one summary for all doesn&#039;t work.<br /><br />If you really want to put this to the test, go to a big department book store, go to the astrology section and find one of those giant astrology bibles. The book you are looking for has detailed write-ups for every single day of the year, and even better books will have date+year combinations. Find the detailed write-up for your exact date of birth, and see if it doesn&#039;t trip you the fuck out.

				If you want an eye opener, go speak to an astronomy prof about astrology for 10 minutes.

				&#039;astrology&#039; means the practical application of astronomy to human use. our response to it must necessarily hinge on our understanding of what it means to be human, because those of us who have been educated in the &#039;values&#039; of modern Western industrial culture, the traditional view of time is as difficult to grasp as is the unfoldment represented by the traditional symbolism of astrology.<br /><br />astronomy interprets the meaning of the zodiac and the planets, just as alchemy interprets the meaning of the elements and the metals. <br /><br />every soul has an astrological-alchemical symbol; this means that man will either squander his salvation or, by the grace of God, attain the meaning of earthly life.

				I&#039;ve done a fair amount of personal study into western astrology and I&#039;ve also dabbled in a teeny bit of vedic astrology.<br /><br />I will say first off that there&#039;s a lot more to astrology than horoscopes and that it can only be validated from a point of view that also accepts mythology and some level of spirituality.<br /><br />A bit of history:&nbsp; <br />In the times that preceded the series conquers by Julius Caesar in Europe around 40-50 BC, astrology was used by the European laymen as a tool for predicting when certain farming activities had to take place such as planting, harvesting, etc. as well as other natural cycles such as female fertility and reproduction. It was after these populations were &quot;urbanized&quot; under the dictatorship rule of Caesar that astrology took a much more ego-centric spin where it began to be used towards personality and life prediction. <br /><br />Astrology is essentially based on archetypes that give certain influences to planets and their relationship with other planets. When assessing a person, astrologers use a birth or natal chart that&#039;s drawn up using mathematical equations based in astronomy of where each planet was located at the time of birth based on the geographical location (longitude and latitude points) of the place of birth. From here the astrologer applies the cosmology of the system they practice in to draw information.<br /><br />There is a trap where people begin to think of these archetypal influences as a predetermined and established outcome. However they are but influences that each have more or less influence at a given time, and we all possess a certain amount of free will that allows us to create our realities. There must be a balance between being aware of what sorts of energies are affecting us on a higher scale and recognizing where we have the power to change. <br /><br />One interesting thing I have noticed by reading into different sorts of astrology over time is that although there are differences across the board, which some are major, but in most cases there are similarities or parallels and at times the information is the same. It is interesting to see how cultures that vary so greatly from each other still found the same or similar meaning when translating the stars and the cosmos in their own way. <br /><br />

There must be a balance between being aware of what sorts of energies are affecting us on a higher scale and recognizing where we have the power to change. <br /><br />One interesting thing I have noticed by reading into different sorts of astrology over time is that although there are differences across the board, which some are major, but in most cases there are similarities or parallels and at times the information is the same. It is interesting to see how cultures that vary so greatly from each other still found the same or similar meaning when translating the stars and the cosmos in their own way. <br /><br /><br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Very well said! <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=166351.msg1242937#msg1242937">Quote from: Hungry ghost on June 16, 2013, 07:30 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">I have found this website to be very useful in sorting the wheat from the chaff:<br /><br />http://skeptoid.com/episode.php?id=4173<br /><br />You mention the moons effect on the ocean; are you suggesting that astrology works by gravity?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Going off what leaf said about influences as well as responding to this question: I believe that these influences of energy that affect us on a day to day basis function much like the weather does. When it&#039;s cold and rainy and miserble outside, we tend to feel less invigorated with energy. Not many I know like to do a whole lot on days like this and people tend to be bitter. On the other hand, comfortable weather tends to make people feel happier, more upbeat, more active etc. <br /><br />I believe that astrology or the effort to understand the influence of the heavenly bodies, not quite like weather, but similar in a way, is based on gravity. You will hear of astrologers talking about retrogrades. This is based on the movement of planets away from and towards us as they move in the cycle around the sun. I don&#039;t know a whole lot about astrology but I think this is the basis of how influences upon earth is determined. These planets are having a gravitational affect upon the forces of earth. Gravity is a wholly complicated force that is still the least understood. It is more than just keeping things &quot;stuck&quot; to each other or in orbit with one another. <br /><br />These retrogrades have a gravitational affect on our planet which affects the chain of forces acting upon us. These influences make us feel certain ways: up, down, passionate, creative, complacent, energized. The manifestations of the complexity of the astronomical bodies as they move in cycles appear in many ways in our lives. It does not mean that you can predict whether you&#039;ll win the lottery based on the movement of the stars and planets. I believe it does mean that you can use these influences in the way that they are understand for various purposes. Some influences are better for creating. Some influences are better for self-reflection, etc.<br /><br />The manifestations of these influences are understood based on the history of their occurence, discovered by minds who were very in tune with their happening. It was a combination of a firm grasp of astronomy, i.e. the predicatable movements of the stars, and observations of what they and others were feeling and what was happening in their lives under a particular sky (during a retrograde, during a full moon etc.). Astrologers today, good ones, are able to interpret these influences because of astronomy, history, intuition, and observation.<br /><br />Astrology is a way to relate a person (based on the time and geographical location of their birth) to the flux cyclical movement of the heavenly bodies. From the moment you were born, you have a very specific relationship to the moon, planets, and stars that is unique from everyone else&#039;s relationship. Signs like scorpio and capricorn etc. are ways to partition this relationship into 12 sections. These influences do not inhibit our free will, they do not at all fortell what specific fortunes will come our way. This is where horoscopes are wrong, imo.<br /><br />I see astrology as simply the interpretation of how the effect of gravity from each heavenly body effects the chain of forces acting upon each individual. The reason people yell BS I think is either because people think astrology is nothing more than those BS horoscopes you may find in the paper OR because no one is able to prove the gravitonal effect that mercury or mars retrogrades have upon our experiences. To say BS because of the latter is a really closed minded way of looking at things because gravity is so hardly understood and often deemed to be a really simple force when it is really so mind-bogglingly complicated that there are probably some really intensely significant things happening when a planet passes us by in the solar system.<br /><br />Don&#039;t bet next month&#039;s rent based on a horoscope, but I think that at least paying attention to the fact that there is a mercury retrograde going on or that there is a full moon or that we have just entered into a new beginning of a 26,000 year cycle (in 2012, the precession of the equinoxes) is just as significant upon our physical reality as atoms bonding together is.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Excellent. I&#039;m going to take the proper amount of time to digest this information.&nbsp; I would love if you could expand on your reference to a 26,000 year cycle, what is this all about?

God&#039;s imagination is reality to us. Our own imagination, is also reality on some level, we cannot deny it also exists &quot;somewhere&quot;. <br />God would probably imagine multiple worlds, and universes. At some stage of development we can travel from one to the next.<br /><br />Yes, by getting born in THIS world - as defined by our body/brain and senses - we probably agree to a set of rules for example so we can&#039;t override nature&#039;s law by our minds. Only in few cases this seems to be possible- otherwise everyone would think of a lion and the lion would suddenly appear (=tendency towards chaos) - IMO this is the very speciality of this world that we have a very solid common ground.<br /><br />However, on &quot;subtle planes&quot;, called &quot;astral plane&quot; by the esotericists, or &quot;common unconcious&quot; by C.G. Jung, we still can work on the &quot;subtle matter&quot;. I&#039;m mentioning this because it&#039;s necessary for the next theory..<br /><br />Back to astrology. I have got an idea how to make up a scientifically theory on how astrology CAN work. <br /><br />Assume, generations of people watching the sky. Sun and moon as the largest celestial bodies from our point of view. Sun has it&#039;s obvious seasons in spring, summer, autumn, winter ... building a rhythm. Moon has some more subtle seasons: waxing, full, waning, new moon-.-..still good for everyone to see who doesn&#039;t sit in a large company&#039;s office (or mum&#039;s basement which is essentially the same). Moons gravity is of minor concern here, unless you also live at the seaside, watching the tides ;)&nbsp; It&#039;s the moonlight that matters because it impresses our imagination !<br /><br />Bright planets like Venus and Jupiter (and sometimes Mars) are seen by most people, too, who take a glimpse at the sky. The least obvious planents would be Mercury and Saturn. Ok, let&#039;s assume, by observation throughout the aeons, people are building subtle seasons for each of these planets.<br />Why ?.. Because it&#039;s the people&#039;s imagination that CREATES these seasons, as analogue to the sun&#039;s seasons.<br /><br />Consequently, after millenia of conscious build-up by millions of observers, rhythms have been established in the astral energies (hey! that&#039;s how they are called! &quot;astral&quot; actually means &quot;stellar&quot; - a giveaway?)<br />SUCH rhythms actually WOULD have an effect on our emotional life (and consequently on our connection to the world, too), and the zodiac is a psychological depicting of these rhythms. <br /><br />//And i wonder if the zodiac shouldn&#039;t get reversed if you are living in australia .. Aries&lt;-&gt;Libra, Taurus&lt;-&gt;Scorpio, etc.. Just as a side note.<br /><br />Now does this make sense?.. Would this be enough to have a serious effect? I think it&#039;s possible.
