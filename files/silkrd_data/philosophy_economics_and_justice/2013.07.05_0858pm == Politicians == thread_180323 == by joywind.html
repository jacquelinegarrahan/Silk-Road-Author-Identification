				One thing weird about major American cities is how the politicans who represent them are just these random nobodies who embark on a political &#039;&#039;career&#039;&#039; when they&#039;ve not done anything. This happens at the state level too - guys like Bobby Jindal. He&#039;s just some random Hindu guy with a lot of money who decided to become governor. Why doesn&#039;t anyone think that&#039;s weird? <br /><br />People have become conditioned to think of politics like they would acting or entertainment. Just random personalities appearing. <br /><br />I mean, guys like Blagojevich and the like are shit-liberals, but Blago was a West Side guy who was plugged into the Outfit. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s weird he had a core of support especially from white proletarians and some of the West Side blacks who thought him better than some alternatives. For practical purposes, Blago was &#039;&#039;one of their own&#039;&#039;. But why would some Louisiana redneck vote for Bobby Jindal? <br /><br />&quot;Racism&quot; exists as a political phenomenon, but not in the way Liberals claim it does. It&#039;s also symptomatic of crises/frailties in the internal situation of any political culture, it&#039;s not a cause of anything in and of itself. Southern blacks and whites didn&#039;t one day decide to hate each other for no reason and thus shape the political divide of the South.<br /><br />Racism functions as the great scapegoat for the shitbird underclass. It&#039;s a convenient narrative that guarantees votes and gives goy liberals un raison d&#039;etre. <br /><br />I might get involved with L&#039;Alliance Francaise and work on the French military shrine so we can talk about the French Empire while I can get laid on the process. Everyone else is a fag. It&#039;s hard to talk with people who don&#039;t know where I am coming from.

Yeah, but I can see that said about any politician running for any position in America, state or federal level. See, most people don&#039;t follow politics and laws - it strains them too much because there are people who do that for their job. Those people are the very politicians who, as you&#039;ve described, are seemingly random. I believe it comes in part from no one being interested in them and their interests and their pursuits. <br /><br />Who knew who Barack Obama was before he was a candidate for president? I keep forgetting he used to be a senator, mainly because there&#039;s not much to say about that right there. Senators (and other politicians for that matter) only get televised when they&#039;re sticking their neck out or being really bold. And unless a politician is going to be bold on a daily basis, we&#039;ll always wind up voting in the most random personalities you can imagine.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;Racism&quot; exists as a political phenomenon, but not in the way Liberals claim it does.

It doesn&#039;t just exist or just happen, it gets used. It is a great scapegoat in one sense, because so many don&#039;t want to admit that they&#039;re in the lower class they are because of their own shortcomings or lack of (or misplaced) effort. But this will always happen when you have a capitalist society as ours where the individual is important to themselves, and the whole country is worth shit to them.
