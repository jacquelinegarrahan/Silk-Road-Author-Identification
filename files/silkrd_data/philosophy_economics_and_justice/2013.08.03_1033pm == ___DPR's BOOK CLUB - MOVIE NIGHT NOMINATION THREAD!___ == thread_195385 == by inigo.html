				So we finally finished up &quot;The Creature From Jekyll Island&quot; and we&#039;ve decided this would be a great time for our second Movie Night! To create some new interest in the book club, we are going to let you guys choose the movie! Use this thread to nominate whatever films you think should be included in a poll, and after we get enough nominations I&#039;ll put up a poll for everyone to vote on which movie we will watch for the 2nd official DPR&#039;s Book Club - Movie Night! <br /><br />Remember the focus of the book club is &quot;agorism, counter-economics, anarcho-capitalism, austrian economics, political philosophy, freedom issues and related topics.&quot; Please try to keep the nominations related to that general realm as much as possible. I know there aren&#039;t many movies that were written or made by people who share these ideas, so finding good ones can be a challenge. However I am confident that of all people the Silk Road community is up for that challenge. <br /><br />Let the nominating begin!<br /><br /><br />P.S. - For those of you who are new to the book club, for our first movie night we watched &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, so don&#039;t bother nominating that as it won&#039;t be included in the poll. I thought it was best to clarify that since I&#039;m sure it will be the first movie to come to mind for many of you.&nbsp; :)

				As obvious as it may be, &#039;1984&#039; would be an excellent choice, or given the recent revelations about how much the NSA is intruding into people&#039;s privacy, a re-watch of &#039;Enemy of the State&#039; might be an interesting one.<br /><br />There&#039;s always &#039;Braveheart&#039; for an excellent look at how one man with unrepentant Libertarian ideals calls his people to arms to collectively rise up against their oppressors.<br /><br />Libertas

				Just a few obvious ones. But great movies nonetheless.<br /><br />Enter The Void : Holy mother of god ! This will tear you apart if you watch this whilst tripping the whole movies based around DMT. But my god... You just need to watch it.<br /><br />Donnie Darko : Confusing as hell story-line but still blows my mind whether I am high or sober.<br /><br />A Scanner Darkly : A film adapted from the Sci-Fi book under the same name by Philip K. Dick. An absolutely amazing storyline and every frame has been filmed then cell shaded. It produces a really nice trippy effect.<br /><br />Spirited Away : A good ol&#039; Studio Ghibli film about some girl that ends up in the spirit world after here parents are turned into pigs (Worth a Watch)<br /><br />Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas : Obviously

				Snatch -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, dicks have drive and clarity of vision, but they are not clever. They smell pussy and they want a piece of the action. And you thought you smelled some good old pussy, and have brought your two little mincey faggot balls along for a good old time. But you&#039;ve got your parties muddled up. There&#039;s no pussy here, just a dose that&#039;ll make you wish you were born a woman. Like a prick, you are having second thoughts. You are shrinking, and your two little balls are shrinking with you. And the fact that you&#039;ve got &quot;Replica&quot; written down the side of your guns...And the fact that I&#039;ve got &quot;Desert Eagle point five O&quot;...

				I like all the suggestions so far. I have two of my own, that I didn&#039;t see mentioned already. <br /><br />The Terminal (Tom Hanks) - I believe this one qualifies because it deals with freedom issues.<br /><br />Altered States (William Hurt) - I don&#039;t really think it fits under any of the themes, but it&#039;s a really wild movie.<br /><br />Anyway, just my two cents.

				Ghost in the Shell (1995)<br /><br />A little dated but absolutely great for foreshadowing the landscape and problems of the future, the original 1995 film Ghost in the Shell lets you take it in on multiple levels, its got action, suspense, provocative philosophical questions, a critique of the direction our society is moving towards, and an overall decent plot.<br /><br />I thus humbly submit this for your consideration.

I agree, inigo, it&#039;s sort of refreshing re-watching it. All of the ideas that are expressed in the movie really change my perspective for several days after I watch it. Also, each rewatch thus far (seen in nearly 10 times) reveals a greater understanding of certain conversations that are sometimes too packed full of information for me to process the first few tmes around.

				It might not fit the criteria well enough but &#039;Momento&#039; is a bloody good movie. It&#039;s about a guy who sustains a head injury and can no longer create new long-term memory, every time he stops thinking about something he forgets it. The last thing he remembers before his injury is his wife getting killed so every morning when he wakes up he thinks it&#039;s just happened and has to live his life based off clues that he doesn&#039;t remember leaving for himself, mostly notes and tattoos on his body.<br /><br />I challenge anyone to watch it and not spend the rest of the day wondering what you would do in his situation.<br /><br />Failing that, I nominate &#039;Fight Club&#039; as it closely fits the criteria. I&#039;ve watched that dozens of times and it never gets old.

Best way to describe it is a psychedelic western. It&#039;s based on a comic called Blueberry and I think you can also find the movie under that name some places.

Very eerie, creepy and challanging movie.<br /><br />Valhalla Rising - A wild man is captured by the king of england&#039;s knights and used for prize fighting, this thought proking movie follows their travels .<br />

				Hmm I was thinking of having it this coming Friday, but with how much response this has received in just the first 24 hours maybe we should put it off til the following Friday to give enough time to get as many votes as possible and narrow down the huge selection to the perfect choice... How does that sound to everyone? We let the nominations come in for a few more days, then we can spend a week narrowing it down with a poll.<br /><br />Unless there is any good reason not to, I say we do this on August 16th.

				I think some of you must not be reading the OP and are suggesting things so unrelated to the focus of the book club that I&#039;ll have to weed a few out when putting the poll together. Don&#039;t get me wrong I&#039;m not strictly defining what relates and what doesn&#039;t, but this isn&#039;t supposed to be a thread for &quot;name a good movie&quot;. <br /><br />That being said, there are a LOT of great suggestions so far! I am really excited to see what you guys end up deciding on. I am surprised there haven&#039;t been very many documentaries nominated yet, considering the focus of the book club, I would think it would be much easier to find documentaries that fit the bill. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195385.msg1412020#msg1412020">Quote from: maxkeiser on August 04, 2013, 09:44 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The secret of Oz- a smaller version of the money masters, although very similar to the creature from jekeyl island, all 3 are brilliant peices of work<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This would be a GREAT choice!! It would tie in perfectly with the book we just finished!! Even if that&#039;s not selected, I am going to have to give this a watch myself, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who was reading the last book with us, or anyone who wanted to but didn&#039;t have the time. This would be a great way to educate yourself on the same subject matter.

				Well I suppose it is specifically the &quot;drug&quot; part of the freedom movement that brings most of us together, so I have no problems with a drug related movie, as long as it has some underlying message about the war on drugs, the legality of them, societies view vs the govt&#039;s view, etc etc. <br /><br />Something that can somehow be tied into the topic of &quot;freedom&quot;.

				It&#039;s kind of a little let of the middle but I highly recommend &quot;The Seven Psychopaths&quot;. It stars Colin Farrell, Christopher Walken, Woody Harrelson, Tom Waits amongst others. Great story line, great acting and you&#039;re guaranteed quite a few laughs at the twists in the plot and how life starts to reflect art in a manner of speaking. <br /><br />I&#039;m not giving the plot away. It&#039;s a great view and one of the best movies I&#039;ve seen it quite some time.<br />Another all time favorite is definitely &quot;The Men Who Stare at Goats&quot; based on the book by the legendary British journalist / author Jon Ronson.<br /><br />Great thread guys!! I&#039;ve now had my must see movie list updated for quite some time now. Just when I though I was starting to run out decent movies to watch. I can&#039;t stand watching most of these overly produced and poorly scripted movies that are constantly spewed out by Hollywood these days. <br /><br />If I so much as hear of one more Fast and the Furious movie or anything remotely akin to such trash being produced again I&#039;ll tear my own hair out! I don&#039;t know how anybody has the patience and mental stamina to sit through such boring drivel?<br /><br />Sorry if I&#039;ve offended any fans of the Fast and the Furious franchise but I highly doubt that there&#039;s anyone here amongst us who fits that profile. At least not on this thread based off of the previous threads I&#039;ve read.<br />

				Star Wars! What a great libertarian struggle. Much better than Star Trek&#039;s &quot;federation knows best&quot; theme. Firefly was a show with a lot of cool libertarian lines so I guess Serenity should be on the list. Dr. Strangelove is one of my favorites. Minority Report, Red dawn. Starship Troopers is a little Fascist but they talk a little about the &quot;failed social experiments of the 20th century&quot; in the movie, much more so in the book. ATLAS SHRUGGED is my nomination. At least until they make &quot;the moon is a harsh mistress&quot; my all time favorite book.

				I just watched waking life after reading this thread, it was a really amazing movie. Extremely thought provoking and it was good to know I&#039;m not the only person who spends hours thinking about this kind of stuff. Several of the conversations in the movie about free will, becoming a new person every 7 years and language were topics I have vigorously debated with friends in the past and the whole thing really struck a chord with me.<br /><br />I will definitely be watching Waking life again, as well as torrenting and watching every single movie suggestion everyone has made here, thanks guys :)

				I&#039;m nominating Steven Soderbergh&#039;s very underrated movie Traffic. It&#039;s not explicitly libertarian, but I think its stinging critique of the War On Drugs should make it a contender. Also, there&#039;s a fabulously anti-government scene where Michael Douglas as newly appointed drugs tsar has to attend a meet and greet function with Capitol Hill legislators who want to pepper the new drugs tsar with all their great ideas for winning the War on Drugs. He has to belt down several tumblers of whisky so he can tolerate all their bullshit. And the kicker is that the politicians were all genuine sitting senators at the time of the movie&#039;s release and were improvising!<br /><br />Great cinematography, too...Soderbergh&#039;s use of filters to differentiate the storylines worked a treat and was widely emulated. Some awesome acting as well. Benicio del Toro, say no more. Don Cheadle was predictably solid and I&#039;ve always loved Luis Guzman; even Catherine Zeta Jones turned in one of her better performances. Oh, and the soundtrack was bloody excellent. Soderbergh even used a 20 year old Brian Eno track from his Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks LP for the final scene of the movie....class. The final scene was touching, too. Civil society asserting itself.

				The Lives Of Others is a fucking excellent movie. Not libertarian in bent, but a scalpel-sharp insight into the workings of the totalitarian state. Of course, softcock social democrats and big government conservatives shake their heads in horror but sleep easy thinking &quot;at least that could never happen to us&quot;, as the state slowly and incrementally assumes more and more control over the individual. <br /><br />Dear OWS idiots - THE STATE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND and never will be, not even if you could somehow enact the ideal state you envisage.<br /><br />I suspect no one mentioned the obvious - Atlas Shrugged - because it wasn&#039;t a particularly good movie.

				While it doesn&#039;t necessarily promote libertarian ideals I think &#039;Wake in Fright&#039; is a cautionary tale of the possibility of libertarian distopia.

				Hey I saw the thread and thought I might check it out. If any of you enjoy or are interested by a more documentary movie about at least a few of the things Inigo mentioned in the OP, then how about the movie ZeitGeist? If anyone else has seen it you should know how great it is and I&#039;m sure your mind has been at least opened up to a huge array of possibilities, If not entirely changing what you believe about the subjects.<br /><br />If you haven&#039;t heard of it I&#039;d say google Zeitgeist movie summary or the such. Really is a quite amazing movie.<br /><br /><br />NS

				&quot;Enter The Void&quot; Here is the wikipedia description &quot; Jump to: navigation, search<br />This is a good article. Click here for more information.<br />Enter the Void<br /><br />Enter the Void is a 2009 fantasy film written and directed by Gaspar Noé and starring Nathaniel Brown, Paz de la Huerta and Cyril Roy. Set in the neon-lit nightclub environments of Tokyo, the story follows Oscar, a young American drug dealer (edit: DMT) who gets shot by the police, but continues to watch succeeding events during an out-of-body experience. The film is shot from a first-person viewpoint, which often floats above the city streets, and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own shoulder as he recalls moments from his past. Noé labels the film as a &quot;psychedelic melodrama&quot;. &quot;

				What about &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; Ii just watched it a few weeks ago and I&#039;m still trying to get my head around the whole film, It can tie in with the theme in that it highlights how everything is connected and how one small thing from the past can inspire a revolution.....Ahem <br /><br />From imdb<br /><br />&quot;An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution. &quot;<br /><br />Plus it&#039;s amazing to try and keep up with it and make sense of it all if your high.

				economic and political type of movie with a good background in a book ?<br /><br /><br />dang. This is hard. how about &quot;Rango&quot; ?<br /><br />it&#039;s about losing all the water, with a town losing all it&#039;s resources backed up by capitalist greed.<br /><br />A good book would be like moving to the west for gold type of thing. were money is all backed up by tangible good or barter like a cool system of trade
