				This is just a book recommendation for Jason Brennan&#039;s Libertarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know.<br /><br />Like every book in the &quot;What Everyone Needs to Know&quot; series, this is formatted as a lengthy question-and-answer session. Brennan, a blogger at bleedingheartlibertarians.com and an academic, certainly has culled all of the familiar talking points from libertarians.<br /><br />Nonetheless, while not being &quot;scholarly&quot; in a sophisticated sense, it maintains a substantive approach to libertarian thought. The failure of minimum-wage legislation is asserted, but also demonstrated using terse economic logic. The prohibition on organ sales is similarly vaporized by such pithy economic analysis. The arguments are concise but still compelling. Moreover, you need not have read David D. Friedman&#039;s Price Theory to grasp the supply-and-demand mechanisms at work.<br /><br />He rightfully paints libertarianism broadly. The movement is not merely Murray Rothbard and doctrinaire Austrianism, but also Chicago-School luminaries like Gary Becker.&nbsp; It&#039;s not only anarchism, but also minarchism, perhaps even support for a classical-liberal safety net for the most needy.<br /><br />Sometimes, though rarely, his arguments are insufficiently nuanced (e.g., the War on Terror), but for the coverage he maintains, most ideas are presented in a substantial fashion.<br /><br />If I had to recommend a book to non-libertarians to grok my thought, it would be this. I believe it can also be appreciated by new libertarians or those that just want to remind themselves of why libertarianism was originally appealing to them. No libertarian will agree with all of his generalizations, but any book will possess such a flaw.<br /><br />

				I&#039;ll have to pick up a copy thanks for the recommendation. <br /><br />Check out &quot;Libertarianism: from A to Z&quot; by Jeffrey Miron<br />it&#039;s basically a dictionary for libertarians (and non-libers) <br />a great read all in all. <br /><br />Also Gary Johnson&#039;s &quot;Seven Principle&#039;s of Good Government&quot;
