				Hey Guys, <br /><br />I am interested in opening up my own greenery in my hometown with my current business partners in my small business now, when it is legalized of course. I have been doing research but I can&#039;t seem to find much information.&nbsp; I would like to get as much information as possible on stores, the pro&#039;s and con&#039;s of the business and the laws regarding it such as, who can grow it for you, do you have to sell under a certain amount, do you have to get it tested, who makes the edibles(in house) or out house, fines associated etc etc.<br /><br />Like I said, we have talked about this, and we need to get more general information to see if this is worth our time, money, and effort.<br /><br />I call them Greeneries, I know the correct term is a Medical Marijuana Dispensary!<br />Thank You, <br />Nuggets

				The amounts and regulations depend on the state / city you are in.&nbsp; <br /><br />The biggest disadvantages are going to be banking / tax issues and the fact that federally marijuana is still illegal and you may be raided by the DEA.

				Thank You, <br /><br />I understand it is still a difficult topic in Politicians eyes. With that being said, this would be in the future anywhere form 2-5 years when my state goes legal. We wanted to go ahead and figure out the in&#039;s and out&#039;s of the green business.

				Sorry for such a late reply, but I figured I would chime in.<br /><br />I had someone close to me run a dispensary in CO. He said it was the biggest hassle he&#039;s ever had to dealt with in his career. You can&#039;t imagine the fees associated with it in comparison to selling it at market prices.<br /><br />Just take a step back and realize you have to pay for rent, licenses, taxes, security, etc etc in addition to being paranoid about the DEA. Not to mention, extreme competition. If money making is as easy as growing a couple plants, you sure as hell bet that there will be tons of people trying to inch their way into the business. <br /><br />Federal law is federal law, no state can avoid submission. <br /><br />I don&#039;t want to discourage you, because no doubt there are shops that make it, but my buddy after having the life experience suggested I never try it. I trust him, he&#039;s been around for several decades. <br /><br />Peace
