				I appreciate the thread of &quot;what happens when you die&quot;.&nbsp; To expand it, I think you can&#039;t know one without the other.&nbsp; Like 1+1= 2.&nbsp; Without either of the halves it is nothing.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if this is a place to be honest considering the high need for anonymity.&nbsp; However I am not here to be anon, as I am here with &quot;Reckless Abandon&quot; to complete my end of life mission.&nbsp; <br /><br />That being said I don&#039;t expect to live much longer, however I am not afraid, I have been afraid maybe but the more I draw out the self the more I understand that the only thing that matters is the spirit.&nbsp; <br /><br />The only thing that concerns me is what happens to the spirit of me when I die.&nbsp; Of course I could die of almost a million different ways, nature is no play thing in that regard with its vast array of weapons, let alone humans also wanting to kill.&nbsp; <br /><br />I am very much well learned in history, there is no way we all will become anyone in this world.&nbsp; DPR has, but at what risk?&nbsp; I guess when you look at it every large seller is DPR because they share the same risks, as what does it matter really with such large sentences, it is for life anyway.&nbsp; But with history on the cusp as long as you don&#039;t end it with a gunfight there is a small chance you might get let out in the future. <br /><br />So maybe life is just a quantified series of risks that we all must face, yet with having to rely on each other is makes it even more complex.&nbsp; We cannot control the risks we will face each day, we can only try to mitigate and minimize the risk.&nbsp; <br /><br />And to conclude I think the soul is what comes out of us after our series of risks.&nbsp; Some violent, some slow diseases, some suicidal, and some peaceful, and some lonely, some of all the above who knows what goes on in the minds of all the dieing people who die each day.&nbsp; What percent were really ready for death?&nbsp; Is life just a series of risks to prepare us for death?&nbsp; But what is death? Well, considering we don&#039;t know what life is how therefore can we assume to know death without knowing it?&nbsp; It seems the only thing that can be used for experiment is &quot;LIFE&quot;.&nbsp; Nothing happens in death as far as we know.&nbsp; However lets look at some other factors shall we throughout history.&nbsp; <br />Death of Rasputin caused the Russians to stay in World War 1 longer than would have been.&nbsp; So by the British murdering him with the help of the Russians even though Rasputin could no longer play a role in world politics, in his death meant things happened a different way.&nbsp; Also in death Franz Ferdinand was murdered which started World War 1.&nbsp; Would Franz Ferdininand started World War 1 if he was still alive?&nbsp; If yes so be it he must have had a diabolical plan and no doubt his death was warranted in the eyes of the killer.&nbsp; If no, than how is it that in death he accomplished that which he could never do with life?<br /><br />So what is more powerful, the learning ability of life?&nbsp; Or the mysterious ability of death to lead the way?

				Death is a transition into whatever comes next (damn, why do I get attracted to these existentsial threads like this?!). As I watch my parents getting closer &amp; closer to their life&#039;s ends, it&#039;s difficult to not worry &amp; fret over dying, but everybody does it. I just finished reading &quot;The Rise of Rome&quot; and I always wondered if, esp. in the early periods of a civilization, the people that become mythical heroes thought they were doing anything other than killing (lots of killing with Rome, in good and bad times). I&#039;ve gotten more into the Bible the last 2-3 years; that may not work for everybody, but it doesn&#039;t seem to harm me. And no, I don&#039;t &quot;beat people over the head with my religion&quot; (way too lar to the left for that).<br /><br />&nbsp;:)

				There is no such thing as death. Life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves. We are part of one eternal consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. We die to remember what we live to forget. Your ego, bank account, family- it&#039;s all an illusion. I am you and you are me. Why should you go about living your life going out of your way to help people that you don&#039;t even know? Because you&#039;re not helping someone else, you&#039;re helping yourself. Eternal love
