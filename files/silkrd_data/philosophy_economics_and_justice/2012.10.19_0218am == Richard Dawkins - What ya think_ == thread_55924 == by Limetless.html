				I think Richard Dawkins is an exceptional scientist, former professor at Oxford University, expert in Biology, and a thought-provoking speaker. As far as his stance on atheism goes, I believe he is misunderstood by many people. He has plenty of intellectual integrity and is determined in his logic and arguments to the point of being militant. He just wishes for all of us to apply reason and evidentialism to pass judgement over scientifically unjustified faith and region (I am not an atheist, but do appreciate his reason and logic), so we may evolve and prosper as a species and progress in technological, intellectual, and other pursuits of our choosing.

				Dawkins is the man! And I&#039;m amazed that this thread has progressed to a second page without someone who is purportedly &quot;no fan of religion&quot; saying how much they HATE Dawkins.<br /><br />And why do they hate Dawkins? Because he is, like, SO rude!<br /><br />There are far too many atheists (or people too cool to identify the term that describes them) who cry about The God Delusion because, hey, atheists don&#039;t need some BOOK to tell them what to think- leave that to the Christians!&nbsp; Meanwhile, these folks can&#039;t find their ass with both hands and a map when they encounter the most elementary, William-Lane-Craig-caliber pro-God arguments imaginable. So Dawkins actually did something very necessary in The God Delusion: he showed you how to demolish the most typical arguments for the existence of God; he codified that shit so you can parrot his rebuttals (assuming they make sense to you) until you come up with something better on your own. <br /><br />To quote/paraphrase Dawkins&#039; friend Daniel Dennett: &quot;there&#039;s nothing that upsets me more than a bad argument for a position I support.&quot; Don&#039;t be part of the problem.<br /><br />A final thought, this time paraphrasing Dawkins: whether or not a proposition is desirable (e.g. the existence of a benevolent, omniscient, omnipotent God) has nothing to do with whether that preposition is TRUE- yet many people seem unable to tell the difference.<br /><br />(OK, one last thing: The Blind Watchmaker is one of the more dazzling Dawkins books I&#039;ve read, and Dennett&#039;s Darwin&#039;s Dangerous Idea is on a whole different level.)

				Most people love Dawkins for his contribution to the Atheist agenda, which I think is fabulous. &#039;The God Delusion single-handedly helped me shed my garb of agnosticism and embrace Atheism completely.<br /><br />However, his scientific contributions are often overlooked in popular media. &#039;The Selfish Gene&#039; has literally revolutionized the way scientists think in many diverse fields, including computer science, cognitive science, physics and philosophy.<br /><br />Easily my favourite Brit. :)

				I have read all of Richard Dawkins books from The Selfish Gene and The Extended Phenotype onwards. I have them all on my bookshelf right now. He is an extremely well respected scientist who changed the way we think about genetics and natural selection, by (I think) showing clearly that the &quot;unit&quot; of genetics that natural selection acts on is the gene, rather than the organism or species.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His evolution books are masterpieces of clear reasoning which, when I first read them, blew my mind completely. For example:<br />&nbsp;<br />Male bees only have one set of chromosomes unlike the usual two.<br />This means that the single male who passes on his genes by mating with the queen contributes 100% of his DNA to the offspring. Thus the female worker bee offspring are related to each other by 3/4 rather than usual 1/2 ( The queen is related to the workers by 1/2 as she has two sets of chromosomes)<br />This means that the best way for a worker bee to pass on genes is to &#039;persuade&#039; her mother the queen to have more children. Hence, the Hymenoptera ( bees and wasps) have evolved the Eusocial behavior they display so often, where the queen has all the children. The workers are not her slaves, she is theirs.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His books are full of elegant, game theory explanations of animal behavior like this. I honestly recommend that everyone should read them if you want to understand how life works.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be honest, I feel like the God Delusion is just him blowing off some steam in old age. He has been a target for creationists for 35 odd years, and I think he just is like &quot;Look you ridiculous people THIS is what I think of your silly book!&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a decent enough read but he tackles the easy targets of religion. I&#039;m an atheist myself ( don&#039;t get me wrong I believe we can only perceive a tiny fraction if the real universe, but what we can understand is amazing. I just don&#039;t think there is anything we should worship as a god) but I would have liked to hear his arguments against the more subtle religious beliefs, rather than the literalists.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Richard Dawkins is a great scientist and I get tired of criticisms of him from people who know only his television work. He rails in his later books against people who read only the title of &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; and feel able to comment on it. &nbsp;As Russell Brand pointed out though, he does resemble Professor Yafl from bagpuss.

				Like the guy and he&#039;s a great scientist, but he can come across as a bit of a dick at times and sometimes as aggressive and fundamentalist as the bible thumpers. At least he uses logic and science for his arguments though. I&#039;ve only read the god delusion and was hooked from that intro to one of the first chapters about the god of the old testament being the most unpleasant character in all fiction!<br /><br />I know he says the book isn&#039;t having a go at the einsteinian god and mostly concentrating on people who believe in the literal truth in the bible/koran/other religious texts but to be fair that&#039;s sort of an easy thing to do. In fact taking on any argument for a prayer answering god is pretty easy and in our rational moments most scientifically thinking people can get there. However, I sometimes think he can be a bit like he&#039;s taking down a strawman.<br /><br />You have to accept that science will never answer everything and there will always be something that no matter how far we advance will be beyond human comprehension.&nbsp; Perhaps i&#039;m moving into einsteinian god territory here but to me this is where total atheism comes unstuck. I&#039;m not talking about a prayer answering god but say something much greater that we can&#039;t comprehend, that allowed existence to be a certain way so that life could develop and the universe could understand itself, then how could we possibly understand other than with the very simple analogies which religion provides. I&#039;m sure the strongest atheist pray when their loved ones are in danger and why is it that every society in human history has had a religion. Yeah they are nothing like the truth in the literal sense. But when a kid asks you how are babies made, you might say when two people love each other they have a baby - its not the truth but an approximation put in a way they can understand, Perhaps that innate tendency towards the theories of religion are the same. Its not a big man with a beard who will answer your prayers sat on a cloud but just maybe there is something, and if it created the universe that something is more than any of us possibly even conceive, so through some fucked means we perceive an approximation of it through religion and theology.<br /><br />Like i say i&#039;ve only read one book and seen a few interviews but i&#039;ve not seen him come out with anything that can counter that but to be fair science probably never could as there&#039;s always gonna be a bigger question but that&#039;s where the atheist argument comes unstuck in my head. For that reason whilst i&#039;ll never believe in a prayer answering god, Dawkins and anyone else is gonna struggle to stop me being agnostic of what i percieve to be god (though my definition of god is probably different to others).

				I HATE organised religion. I HATE any centralized organisation of peoples thoughts (political parties included). I dont know a whole lot about dawkins but i understand his a very intelligent man however i get the impression he is the head of atheism(if they have one, his at least the spokesperson or posterboy) which is quickly starting to become very hard to distinguish from a religious organization or a political party. Humans were given the ability of free-thought which supposedly separates us from most animals yet the majority tend to choose not to use it and the manipulative (predators, no different to sexual predators) take advantage of this.<br />Sorry in advance for anybody offended just had to get that rant out.<br />peace<br />BC

				From &quot;the selfish gene&quot;, I infer he&#039;s a great biologist, but from most of the media appearances he&#039;s made, he&#039;s an annoying preacher and integrist, as close-minded as the people he accuses. And worse, for someone puts rationality before everything, he makes a lot of fallacies. Last, he also ignores the virtues of religion and only focus on its dysfunctions. <br />

The domains do overlap. Scientific ideas have philosophical/religious implications.<br /><br />For example: there appears to be design in nature. This design, it was once thought, implies a designer, i.e. God. But Darwin&#039;s theory of evolution by natural selection provided an explanation for the appearance of design that, rather counterintuitively, does not require a designer. This idea most certainly has philosophical/religious implications - namely, that God doesn&#039;t need to exist - and this was immediately recognized by the countless Christians who opposed Darwinism and continue to do so.<br /><br />Dawkins actually agrees with the Christian fundamentalists on a key point: whether or not evolution is true MATTERS. Stephen Jay Gould and most liberal, secular &quot;Christians&quot; do not hold this view.<br /><br />So was the question, &quot;Can organized complexity come into being without the intervention of a designer,&quot; a philosophical question or a scientific one? I would say it&#039;s both- maybe even more philosophical- but there can be no doubt that it was science, not philosophy, that provided the definitive answer. Consequently, an intimate understanding of the mechanisms of natural selection is crucial for anyone presenting a modern defense of atheism, and that&#039;s why Dawkins is as qualified as anyone to do what he does.<br /><br /><br /><br />* - Just recently a friend of mine said this (&quot;Dawkins is a philosophical philistine who should stick to biology.&quot;) I then asked him to name a single living philosopher (&quot;since you clearly give a fuck about philosophy.&quot;) He couldn&#039;t. I&#039;m not saying that&#039;s the case with anyone in the thread, but it was revealing...

				Now I&#039;ve got time to tell you what I like about him. I have read a few of his books and it is the flow of logic that stands out to me. They are the closest to reading a math book you can get without actually reading a math book. When I first started reading The God Delusion I worried that on the next page there would be thought errors and I&#039;d have to throw the book away, but it never happened. His books are some of few books I manage to read about religion etc., because they don&#039;t frustrate me. I feel safe and calm reading Dawkins. What I admire perhaps even more is his patience, that he sits on these shows and has the patience to talk to people who spit bullshit at him, without ever loosing his temper or tranquility. When they don&#039;t listen/understand and run away from the discussion point, Dawkins will just sit in his chair and repeat the point seemingly unconcerned. Also, his voice is a bonus, I love that accent, and he is a pleasure to look at as well. Whenever I have an argument with someone about religion I tell them to read Dawkins, because if they don&#039;t understand the logical fallacies of religion when Dawkins spells them out it, they won&#039;t understand them when I say them.

I like repeating facts especially when I am barraged by emotional bullshit from others.

				RD is a very clear thinker and an exceptional mind. I nominate him troll of the previous decade. I also understand why some people are irritated by him. It&#039;s partly because they&#039;re hearing something they don&#039;t like, but also that they&#039;re being preached to. But I think this is OK to some extent, in order to redress something that has been out of balance for a long time. Many of us have had a whole lot of being preached to by evangelical Christians/Muslims and others. So there&#039;s a certain amount of the shoe being on the other foot for a change. I doubt this will cause vast quantities of introspection, but at least pine finds it humorous that many religious people find Dawkin&#039;s propositions outrageous bullshit, because funnily enough that&#039;s pretty much exactly... Well anyway. Pine is clearly enjoying the schadenfreude moments, so precious!<br /><br />But in all seriousness you have to read The Selfish Gene to understand his ideas proper. In fact you might want to read the Origin of Species as well. Many of his statements that people take the wrong way are actual biological statements of fact and it&#039;s not a matter of &quot;well, that&#039;s just your opinion man&quot;. These may not be what you think they are, you have to read his stuff. You cannot describe something as arrogant if it&#039;s actually true. Dawkins pissed off a whole bunch of people who were going along with the concept of &#039;group selection&#039; for example. It&#039;s not that he&#039;s militant about religion in particular. He&#039;s militant about anything he sees as an untruth.<br /><br />For example. Pine&#039;s obvious pet example. People are completely wrong if they don&#039;t accept they need to hide the paperwork related to their illegal transactions from LE agents using cryptography. Is that arrogant? No. It&#039;s a description of reality. We know empirically that people who don&#039;t use crypto get mowed down in a bust. If you do the (grisly) research of reading the court statements from situations like child exploitation rings or stolen(intercepted!)/declassified LE and intelligence documents, this will just jump out at you. <br /><br />Nonetheless, there is a distinction between telling people facts and calling people names. It&#039;s fun to call people names, but not very productive if you want people to see your point of view. FWIW RD isn&#039;t trying to convert people to &#039;atheism&#039; or something. He&#039;s trying to unearth those people who are mild mannered, who aren&#039;t believers but are &#039;quiet&#039; about it to make life easier. Since he began his project along with a few others, the number of declared agnostics/atheists in the USA has dramatically increased in the polls by several hundred percent or something crazy like that. It&#039;s not that they all didn&#039;t exist before, it&#039;s that they were, well, afraid to express their opinion too openly.<br /><br />The only real distance between Dawkin&#039;s views and mine is that I&#039;m content with a certain type of believer. The type who are thoughtful enough to think logically about their worldview, often have a very different point of view to the classical believer (follows church social custom but hasn&#039;t actually read his/her bible and thought about the contents). I wouldn&#039;t describe them as more &#039;liberal&#039; in their views, they&#039;re frequently more extreme. But they are consistent. That&#039;s important. So long as they are able to converse without finding it a personal affront that somebody else has a different opinion, I can live with such people. This is called tolerance, and it&#039;s in short supply. Dawkins is never going to physically force believers to change their views, but many Christians in the States could take a leaf out of the Bible (some biblical principals are excellent, a fact that Dawkins also recognizes, his critique is actually a whole lot more selective than you might imagine at first) and turn the other cheek, probably some unbelievers as well.<br /><br />The only thing that confuses me about Dawkins is that he is a socialist. To me that&#039;s replacing a metaphysical god with a secular one, but that&#039;s another story. <br /><br />Conversely it is also inconsistent, at least to myself, when believers in god appreciate the market, but don&#039;t apply similar principals elsewhere. Competition and the division of labor are universal principals, whether we&#039;re calling them titles like evolution or capitalism.<br />

The domains do overlap. Scientific ideas have philosophical/religious implications.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />While domains do overlap all the time (it&#039;s not like the universe is actually constructed from a field of discrete mathematics), it is also true that &quot;asshats&quot; from one field will mouthflap away on topics they haven&#039;t an inkling about. <br /><br />Just because one guy is good with, say, mathematics, doesn&#039;t make him a good chemist or historian, and visa versa. Fields of academia in particular tend to be highly compartmentalized, expertise in one area doesn&#039;t predicate expertise in another no matter how confident the speaker sounds.<br /><br />A classic example of this is economics and sociology. Sociologists are usually quite confident they know something about economics. They are almost always wrong. This is for the above reason, but it is also that sociologists in particular have an especially strong illusion of competence in this field from a political perspective, when people&#039;s collective opinions don&#039;t actually have a whole lot to do with economics, it&#039;s literally a different level of organization, they are living in the moment when what they are bladdering about takes place over decades or even centuries. It&#039;s like biologists finding political repercussions they dislike from the rules of chemistry, it&#039;s actually lubriciously inane, it just doesn&#039;t sound like it because of scientism. e.g. the way a lot of people know a whole lot of tech jargon from using a particular corporations products e.g. Mac, but don&#039;t get the fundamentals of tech.<br /><br />However I don&#039;t think NOMA is quite the same thing because religion does (or did) make certain claims that are scientific in nature. e.g. the age of the universe or earth in some cases. I think people today sometimes forget that Science used to be called &quot;Natural Philosophy&quot;, and was in fact part and parcel of &quot;Religion&quot; several centuries ago. All the major scientists in history were religious, being very religious was (for some genuine individualists, it still is) a higher motivation to learn what we today call Science. People laugh at the &#039;household gods&#039; of the Greeks/Romans and others, e.g. the god of wine, dancing etc. But I think we&#039;re forgetting that such &#039;household gods&#039; have their roots in concepts that today are not considered religious by either scientists and/or the faithful. A &#039;house god&#039; was a particular way of thinking about the world, not necessarily religious in the sense we think of it today. It would be more accurate to think of some gods, I&#039;m thinking of finance, as being mascots or corporate logos for a way of seeing the world, rather than literal metaphysical entities that people really believed existed. Consider the idea of the &#039;Market&#039; or &#039;State&#039; in this context. Are these gods worshiped? In a way, yes they are. So my point is that many seemingly metaphysical concepts were actually rooted in practical memeplexes, and thus what is newer is the idea that NOMA exists. That religion is completely separated from science or philosophy is a very new idea, not an ancient one. People seem to think our ancestors were complete godbothering twits with the simplest possible frame of reference. Actually that&#039;s not quite right... we have probably about the same per capita amount of twits per hectare as we always have done...<br /><br />As long as people, yano (word theft from Limet), think, we should be happy. It&#039;s anybody who accepts the status quo overly so that concerns me, and that can be any ideological framework, including my own which is capitalism, which is why I have read the works of Veblen and Marx as well as Smith and Hayek. It is similar to the deal where you purchase a copy of the New York Times and the Economist, and compare and contrast, that is a way to aggregate more meaningful information, that is what it really means to be a skeptic. You&#039;re not necessarily a skeptic just because you think religion is dumb. Being an skeptic is an activity, not a fixed position.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />

				I think he makes some reasonable anti-theist points, but not as well as Christopher Hitchens, and I do not think he has much interesting to say philosophically about atheism. Doesn&#039;t explore the moral implications of an atheist position, as someone like Sartre or Dostoyevsky does; comes up with his own commandment based morality in the God Delusion which annoyed me. Also saw him speak a few times, he tended to extend the range of his argument quickly in the last 10 mins or so - you know, go from: &quot;So we have no arguments that prove the existence of God...therefore science will one day be able to explain everything; there is a probably a multiverse.&quot; <br /><br />I guess my relationship to him is that I read the God Delusion and went from agnostic to atheist, now am more inclined to think that the sort of arguments put forward by people like Dawkins show the absurdity of an &#039;old man in the sky&#039; type position, but his &#039;science is the one true path&#039; type position isn&#039;t really enough for me either. But maybe he&#039;s right and I&#039;ll have to shut up whining for something more. His stuff about how great and fascinating and beautiful the scientific view of the world is is certainly great to read...but then so are stories of God - the human imagination and its history are just as fascinating as the world outside, at least from my perspective.

I was an atheist and a materialist at the time of that particular trip.&nbsp; I now believe in God, although I am not committed to any one religion. If anyone wants to experience God, I would recommend the ingestion of about 300ug of LSD in a comfortable setting, while focusing the mind on the eternal present. This will evoke a mystical experience in which the Self goes outward and finds the One in the external world.&nbsp; The experience is phenomenologically indistinguishable from&nbsp; the reports of mystical experiences described by traditional mystics.<br /><br />What Richard Dawkins needs is 300 ug of good LSD and an open mind. <br /><br />I have since learned that Richard Dawkins also has a very poor understanding of theology and philosophy. He presents school boy arguments against theism. He doesn&#039;t define what level of God he is talking about. He &quot;refutes&quot; mythic-magical conceptions of God as if they were applicable to transrational and integral conceptions of God (see Ken Wilber).&nbsp; I recommend watching the videos of William Lane Craig for a thorough refutation of Richard Dawkins. For example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP9CwDTRoOE . Although he is a Christian, his arguments are applicable to a generic theism.&nbsp; I also recommend looking up Ken Wilber for a non-Christian perspective on these issues.<br /><br />

This is why people find it difficult to believe you can experience God on LSD. They think it&#039;s some kind of hallucination. It&#039;s not. It&#039;s not something that can be defined in terms of sensation. Nor is it an emotional or ecstatic experience. It has the quality of perception, not of emotion.

You can&#039;t describe its qualities, because it has no qualities. You can&#039;t describe its activity, because it is at rest. You can&#039;t describe its relationships, because it is without a second and is not the object of anything but its own self. Hence it cannot be defined by an idea. God is a pure subject that cannot be made into an object. To devise a scientific test in order to &#039;verify&#039; its existence would be to look for an object, but by the very nature of the case, it cannot be made into an object, for it has no other but its own self. No, if you want proof of God, you will have to either submit to years of disciplined meditation and concentration, or you can try taking a higher dosage of LSD with an open mind. In this sense, God is a testable hypothesis.

That is an absurd statement. W.T. Stace, one of the world&#039;s foremost authorities on mysticism, has this to say regarding the LSD induced experience: &quot;It is not a matter of being similar to mystical experience; it is mystical experience.&quot;&nbsp; Again, he insists, &quot;The fact that the experience was induced by drugs has no bearing on its validity.&quot; <br /><br />Based on a&nbsp; historical survey of the literature of mysticism, scholars have also developed nine criteria of mystical states of consciousness, and have shown that LSD produces a state of consciousness that is phenomenologically indistinguishable from mystical experiences:<br /><br />&quot;Implications of LSD and Experimental Mysticism&quot; by&nbsp; Walter N. Pahnke &amp; William A. Richards (http://www.psychedelic-library.org/pahnke4.htm)<br /><br />If you wish to show that LSD has &#039;nothing to do with mysticism&#039;, you would have to demonstrate that it doesn&#039;t meet any of these criteria.<br /><br />In any case, I think I know the contents of my own experiences better than anyone else. I&#039;ve experienced mystical states without drugs,&nbsp; by disciplined meditation and concenntration, and LSD does produce the same kind of state of consciousness.&nbsp; If the LSD experience is not at times mystical in nature, then the difference is so subtle as to be indistinguishable.<br /><br />

				Amazing how many chemical users there are here...now if anyone of them had the smallest amount of background in the chemical sciences. <br /><br />Your brain is a mess of chemical reactions, this is a simple fact.

				Several years ago I was an evangelical Christian (albeit an intelligent, informed, progressive one), so Richard Dawkins was supposed to be, you know... working for Satan or something.<br /><br />My first impressions while listening to the guy was that he made some really good points about the pitfalls of monotheism as practiced today but he came off as a raging asshole about it.&nbsp; I guess if I was standing up on a podium talking about our culture&#039;s interpretation of monotheism I&#039;d start raging too, but at the time he made a poor impression as a personality.<br /><br />In more recent years I&#039;ve much more enjoyed listening to him talk about Darwin and evolution because his mood lightens, you can hear the excitement in his voice, and during his examples and explanations he&#039;s very eloquent without sounding overtly British.

				I&nbsp; love his spirit in all of this. Dawkins receives a stream of hate mail, death threats and such continuously. Instead of feeling sorry for himself, he sometimes recites them on video, and especially enjoys the one that wish that he burns in hell - a very moot threat to an atheist. I suppose he sees the irony in that better than most people are able to.

				Thats a great book indeed, although the concept really doesn&#039;t require a whole book to explain.
