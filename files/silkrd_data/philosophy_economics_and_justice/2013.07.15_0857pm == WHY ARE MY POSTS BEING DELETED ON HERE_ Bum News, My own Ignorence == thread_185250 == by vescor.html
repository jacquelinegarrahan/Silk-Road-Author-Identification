				This is a exact copy of my first post.<br />Maybe I say too much?<br /><br />I now realize the errors of my ways.<br />This battle must ONLY be fought in the heart soul and mind, no where else.<br />Fear not death, for when the storm clouds gather, you&#039;ll feel better if you remember the sun.<br /><br /><br />Did you ever feel different?<br />Not sure why?<br />overly emotional, yet knew when things are about to happen?<br />WATCH ---Southland Tales--- and read read read.<br />There&#039;s 3 waves of Volunteers.&nbsp; --- Dolores Cannon<br /><br />Afraid of U.S. Gov? ----Bum News, Streets of LA<br />« on: June 28, 2013, 09:08 am »<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Quote<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Modify<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Remove<br /><br />Hello Brothers and Sisters,<br />I got some shit to tell ya&#039;ll.<br />First off, I wish to be known now as Ve$c0r.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have had a much more prestigious nameS in the past, but that means nothing now other than to clarify I am not a newbie to the game both on the street and in the clouds(online), but I am new to tor; I haven&#039;t touched a computer for the last 5 years, just a lot of reading.<br />Now that i got a laptop I can experience TOR!<br />God bless this opportunity which allows all walks of life can talk freely across the globe with little expertise in networking, coding or ect.<br /><br />Just as a quick get to know me-<br />Getting a laptop might not sound like a big deal, but I&#039;m home free, or you might say homeless.&nbsp; So now its needless to say, I&#039;m broke, plus i fucked with tech most my life. I kinda wanted an escape.<br />I was a I.T. guy, mainly Data base admin, started selling drugs and made a ton of money.&nbsp; got cocky, got caught, did time, got out and only wanted to play my guitar and travel America.<br />So I live on the streets wrapped in a sleeping bag and tarp to disguise myself as a piece of garbage, lol-true!<br />&nbsp;I&#039;m a good looking guy, good hygiene, but I said fuck the world, and pursued travel, sex and all around anarchy.<br />I been all over the USA, prefer around Los Angeles.<br />I Seen everything out here, or so I thought.<br /><br />CRAZY SHIT IS HAPPENING AND NOW ITS THE LAST STRAW!<br /><br />Quick notes:<br />---They lock the doors at every park bathroom at night then the news films People pissing in the streets.&nbsp; --- This upsets the yuppies makes them hate us.<br />---They ticket us for sleeping---WTF<br />---Cops make the gangs clear out the youngsters.&nbsp; I know, because the gangs tip me off and ask me to try to clear them before they have to beat the sleeping kids up--This is politics, but we try to protect the streets from 5-0, all of us here.<br />---I seen cops rape a Chica right on the beach....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />---Every Thursday the 5-0 rounds up the streets to a large park.&nbsp; TODAY I was near a large SFV park and I was Horrified.<br />---THEY ARE MOVING US TO AN UNDISCLOSED AREA!!!!<br />Probably justified by saying they had warrants on the people, which is true they&#039;re warrants for unpaid sleeping fines, violations.<br />---but its a misdemeanor to sleep in a car, check the new laws.<br /><br />And The list goes on.<br /><br /><br />I knew them, most are good people that fell onto the streets recently, they can&#039;t survive alone.&nbsp; I help all my fellow Americans, I share my last food with the hungry.&nbsp; I help elderly with bags and all sorts of love and street passion.&nbsp; - plus, they usually they tip well without asking, but hey! This is California KICKDOWNS. Code of the streets, we all know it here!<br />Then I smoke a blunt and hit on the wanna-be actresses.<br /><br />RECENTLY, old ladys have been the least of the street-veteran concerns including myself.<br />There&#039;s alot more, like ten times more fallen yuppies. Young, old, guys, girls, sober, fucked, or what-eve.&nbsp; Some of them go insane instantly.&nbsp; Many us old schools Home-Frees chose this life, They didn&#039;t.<br />&nbsp;We try to look out for them, but we don&#039;t got much.&nbsp; least I can do is teach them the ropes because many go insane or get hurt.&nbsp; Especially the pretty chicas,&nbsp; They all been tricked and kicked.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />I know everyone on these streets, I know when my street children, brothers and sisters disappear...&nbsp; I heard the rumors, and noticed people missing.<br />&nbsp;On 6-27-13 at 2:00 Cali time, I SEEN it.<br /><br />I seen a lot more in my travels,&nbsp; Too much to write.&nbsp; Lets just say I&#039;m convinced we have&nbsp; 5-10 years before martial law if we&#039;re lucky.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;ll post more if I get the same love here as on the street.<br /><br />But anyways, This reminds me of a&nbsp; story my grandma told me.<br />One day she looked out the window and seen people cuffed and taken by the Nazis, a few weeks later they KILLED my grandmas family as she stayed hidden in a closet.<br /><br />YOU ALWAYS START MARTIAL LAW WITH CONTROLLING THE LOWEST LIKED PEOPLE!<br />THE US GOV KNOWs A SHIT STORMs COMING AND THEY ARE PREPPING!<br /><br />HELP ME, I HAVE A PLAN!<br />I need to set up farm/bases to sustain food and rest for future people of the struggle across the USA. because we believe war is coming.<br />Yes I said &quot;we&quot;<br />I&#039;m Reppin a few Street-Veterans here.<br />We got plans<br />WE NEED CAPITAL,<br />are not asking -directly- for money, I&#039;m a bum, not a beggar- there is a difference.<br />However I used to be a hella Dealer and I know EVERYONE in LA.<br /><br />PLEASE FRONT ME MDMA!&nbsp; I WILL PAY IT BACK!<br />and I&#039;ll become a great return customer, because I&#039;m gonna sell the shit out of it!<br />I mean FUCKING KIs across the whole country!<br />plus you&#039;ll be assured proceeds are going to the future prep.<br />I Chose to say fuck money a while ago, but if I fight without it, It will just be me throwing a empty jack bottle at a cop.<br />Either way I&#039;ll fight to the death.<br /><br />These songs of freedom, are all I ever had....-Bob Marley<br />And that&#039;s all I have, except for this new 10 year old laptop!<br /><br />I understand if you don&#039;t trust me, but please at least research events like these across the country and spread the word.<br />&nbsp;<br />Once, I almost dehydrated to death screaming for water as yuppies laughed in the dessert. So Hot I even had 1st degree burns from the sun.<br />BUT... When I make it, I will let them drink from my wells, and break bread.<br />I&#039;m doing this for everyone, one way or another.<br /><br />Thank you for reading,<br /><br /><br />Ve$cor,<br /><br /><br />The mentally challenged bum on many California curbs playing a mean guitar.<br />&quot;maybe he&#039;s not slow, maybe that&#039;s all an act?&quot;<br />Maybe I was just watching.&nbsp; Front Seat, Watching It all.<br />Shows over, time to get up, stand up...

				Wow, My own ignorance shines bright.<br />Thank you for showing me the truth brother.<br />Can you tell me why they don&#039;t show in the main Philosophy, Economics and Law topic page anymore.<br />It got 359 views, much karma, and responses. plus my poll indicated many want me to continue writing<br /><br />i guess i been so paranoid lately with what has been going on. I guess I jump to conclusions without proper evaluation.<br />Thankfully I didn&#039;t make any dangerous accusations<br /><br />Fun fact, Youtube counts are rigged. This I can Prove.<br />Watch ----4th of july rights taken. video,<br />I seen it have 2 mill, then 500k another day it had 1.7 mill and once again fell to 700k by night.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thank god they&#039;re not as strong as I thought. <br />I was starting to worry Tor may be a honeypot.<br /><br />Then again paranoia means your on top of your shit.<br /><br />There&#039;s a whole lot more cop presence in L.A. since the 4th...<br />They even broke my laptop on &quot;accident&quot; and left without even a sorry...<br />however, I still write.<br /><br /><br />Somehow I didn&#039;t disappear yet even though I&#039;m losing friends quickly. No one knows where they are.<br />911<br />hospitals<br />jails<br />shelters<br />no one can give information. even when I lie and say I&#039;m family.<br />And I say and do a lot...<br /><br />&nbsp;

				On a semi cold, cloudy 3rd of July, I made my way down the mountain and made my way around the City of Angels. <br />Tears fill my eyes as I write because I have a feeling i NEVER had before.<br /><br />Allow me to back up a couple days while I been gone in the no hotspot/wifi zones of the L.A. national forest.<br />5,000 feet up in the air, I wished many a times I could reach the clouds and speak to y&#039;all.<br />on my hike up the mountains I spoke to many home-frees and like I suspected many said there is a camp, and many didn&#039;t.&nbsp; They all did confirm massive amounts of federal agents in the forest, including possible BLACKWATER sightings.<br />One possible coincidence was all the low flying military-like(I have not confirmed they&#039;re military) choppers.<br />Either way I personally seen no camp.<br />Then one man stood out among the others USMC .issue dessert DIGI pants.<br />I met him laying in the sun with a look of discontent whistling the intro to war&#039;s low-rider.&nbsp; I starting singing and dancing along. He suddenly stopped and with a very serious look he only said &quot;WAR&quot;<br />I looked back stunned and replied,<br />&quot;I tried to tell everyone, but in the matrix they made to think you crazy.&quot;&#039;<br />&quot;&#039;Tellém what?&quot;&#039; he asked<br />to catch and protect myself from a possible agent I quickly said,<br />&quot;That the classics like WAR is making a comeback soon.&quot;<br />then I started sing Buffalo Springfield - For What Its Worth.<br />After that he teared up, which in return lead to me tearing.<br />I knew I found another BANDANA.<br /><br />Without hesitation he said<br />&quot;come and see&quot;<br />and I looked and behold,<br />A pale horse,<br />his name was death and hell followed with him. --- Johnny Cash<br /><br />CASKET &quot;LINERS&quot;....<br /><br />Now I don&#039;t care what you read or did not.<br />GO TO LOCATION AT THE END OF STONYVALE OFF BIG TUHUNGA RD IN THE L.A, NAT. FOREST!<br />I have SEEN&nbsp; seen more then I could count.<br />Big enough to fit many in each. <br /><br />He said,<br />&quot;This is more acceptable then throwing ém in a hole, Acceptance is everything&quot;<br /><br />I sat in awe after smoking a blunt with the man for the rest of the day.<br />We didn&#039;t mention it to each other again.<br />the only other thing he said about the topic was,<br />&nbsp;&quot;please have a very very safe 4th&quot;<br />.<br />&nbsp;Allow me to return to that topic.<br /><br />First I need to immortalize in our clouds someone I miss.<br /><br /><br />She is absolutely beautiful inside and out.<br />She was treated worse then a dog in these streets.<br />She carried a dirty blanket, jacket and a lot of trauma which made her appear &quot;special&quot;<br />All I wanted to do was GIVE her something better.<br />After months of keeping her warm in my bedroll, which is more time than I ever spent with someone without ever trying to make an advance.<br />with big smiles she once asked me if she saved up the money for us, would I accompany her to six flags.<br />This touched me in a way I can&#039;t explain. This girl can&#039;t afford to eat, and she wanted to pay for us to go to six flags, I said,<br />&quot;Of course baby girl, I&#039;d love to.&quot;<br />That day she got picked up on sleeping in public warrants and I haven&#039;t seen her again.<br />The police wouldn&#039;t even give me info on how to find her, they said it was<br />&quot;out of their hands.&quot;<br />I still have hope.<br /><br />Returning back to topic, I left the forest this morning and couldn&#039;t believe the word on the streets.<br /><br />EVERYONE IN THE STREETS OF L.A. BELIEVES SOMETHING BIG IS GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW...<br />I heard two guys saying there&#039;s going to be a lot of booming by the police, and that they where going to bang back...<br />I thought 2 things<br /><br />What did I miss?<br />Please no, not yet,<br /><br />NON POSSUM ILLA VESCOR...<br />&nbsp;<br />PLEASE BROTHERS AND SISTERS, DON&#039;T CARRY A WEAPON TODAY OUTSIDE YOUR HOMES.<br />And pray that armed march on DC do NOT HAPPEN tomorrow.<br />SOMEONE(s) MAY BE LOOKING FOR A REASON TO TAKE OUR INDEPENDENCE&nbsp; THIS INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br /><br />Please brothers and sisters, stay safe AT HOME.<br />especially anyone from Southern California.<br /><br />I was once told I will die for this...<br />I now fully came to grasps that they where right.<br /><br />I been working on this project for a while and tried quite a bit to get the start up capital. It still amazes me how hard it was to get nowhere. I had about $600 saved, but the cops robbed me while taking me in for a warrant. I was handcuffed with $600, left with $10. I talked to a lawyer and he simply looked like a desperado when he said,<br />you know they&#039;ll believe a cop over a, don&#039;t mind me, but a beach bum supposedly holding $600.<br />Damn it too, he was right.<br />but I&#039;ll fight to the death.<br /><br />Bless you all, stay vigilant tomorrow.<br />I will Pray for you all.<br /><br />LET THE&nbsp; Shoreline RUMORS START, LISTEN TO E-DUBBLE - DOGFACE GO -----CAREFULLY.

				They&#039;re still in that subforum - maybe they aren&#039;t showing because the other more recent posts people have made have pushed yours down several pages ... but they&#039;re definitely still there.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have to worry about what you say here - the only posts we delete are those that are spam, scams, or endangering others.&nbsp; <br /><br />So keep posting to your heart&#039;s content without fear of those posts disappearing!
