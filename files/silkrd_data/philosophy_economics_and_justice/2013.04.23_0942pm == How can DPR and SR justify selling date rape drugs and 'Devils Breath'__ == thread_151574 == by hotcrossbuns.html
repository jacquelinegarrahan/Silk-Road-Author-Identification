				(dyslexic so soz about the grammer/spelling)<br /><br /><br />Hey,<br /><br />So I have noticed it is very uncommon to criticise what we have hear atm.<br />I can understand why, the concept of SR and the way in which it has been <br />set up is an amazing achievment and great step in the right direction for Human <br />Rights and personal choice IMO. <br /><br />However I do believe that even in this environment there needs to be some kind of <br />line in the sand. I am not trying to end the party early, I like taking drugs, smoking weed etc etc.<br /><br />I just don&#039;t think the two drugs I mentioned in the title should be made available, <br />imagine if you are a potential rapist, this would be the perfect place for you to get the drugs to<br />do so. Completely anonymous, no witness and little if any trace of purchase. <br /><br />( if you do not know what Devils breath is, google Devils Breath Vice, watch that film)<br /><br />We now have the freedom to purchase drugs openly, but it does not mean we should do away with morals.<br />The argument for legalisation of drugs from private compaines such as SR will be delt a blow when some high<br />profile rape/overdose story hits the press as LE would love societys opiion firmly pressed against us even more.<br /><br />any thoughts?

				I am glad you agree, I understand that they have other uses and im sure the seller has taken great pains to portray that on his vender page to make him seem human. Lets be honest thou, who really wants to take a drug that could cause memory loss and amenisa when you could get simular downers without such harsh side effects.<br /><br />It is not up to me either, but are opinions can still carry some worth. If enough users of SR were anguished by this of course it would not be sold it wouldn&#039;t be economically viable to piss everyone off and this place must all be about money in the first and foremost sense for selling it anyway. <br /><br />I might be the first to say it, I like the concept of SR but this not anti-capitalist wet dream as some people make it out, this is so another person/group can get filthy rich.

				You can use MDMA as a date rape drug. You can use LSD for some pretty intense psychological torture. You can use scopolamine (&quot;Devil&#039;s Breath&quot;) for alleviating nausea and motion sickness. You can use Rohypnol as an anxiolytic and sedative. Few drugs are truly malevolent, and few truly benevolent. The Silk Road community exists by the tacit trust we have in each other to use and distribute responsibly.

				You realize that few drugs other than alcohol are actually ever used as date rape drugs right?

				I think it&#039;s a topic worth discussion.&nbsp; I&#039;d say the only intended use of scopolamine is to cause harm to others.&nbsp; It&#039;s more like a chemical weapon than a drug.&nbsp; There must be a line to be drawn no?<br /><br />I understand a lot of people didn&#039;t like the fact SR used to sell guns.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t this the same?

				Alcohol is the most prevalent date rape drug and in the USA can be purchased in just about every convenience store.&nbsp; It&#039;s about time that we stop living in the 80&#039;s and going along with the misleading media hype that existed back then regarding Rohypnol for eg. as a date rape drug.&nbsp; It was a period where the DEA somehow managed to convince the federal government to violate the countries constitution by passing the legislature for the &#039;Emergency Scheduling Act&#039;, and the media was either interested, coherced, or just had no other news to report on and started a fear mongering campaign as they&#039;re well known to do for just about everything under the sun to bolster the DEA&#039;s circumvention of the right&#039;s of American citizens.&nbsp; It was played up really big when for a short time there were a few cases of date rape using an exotic chemical ... vs. just alcohol, but that only lasted until Roche added a blue dye to it&#039;s Rohypnol so that if someone&#039;s drink had been laced they&#039;d know it.&nbsp; <br /><br />In reality Rohypnol is just a potent Benzodiazepine leaning towards the hypnotic spectrum of benzodiazpine&#039;s.&nbsp; Why don&#039;t we just call Haldol and a number of other&#039;s date rape drugs?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it was a fearmongering campaign initiated by the DEA to divert people&#039;s attention that they could schedule a drug any way they wanted, even when their own internal judges found that a drug should be scheduled in another class (eg. 1985 Judge Francis Young was thrown off the bench when he concluded that MDMA should be classed as a Schedule II drug so that researchers and doctor&#039;s had access to studying it, and not even day&#039;s later the DEA enacted it&#039;s &#039;Emergency Scheduling Act&#039; to place MDMA as a Schedule I drug.&nbsp; Here we are almost 30 years later with only empirical evidence of it&#039;s long term effects, when Judge Younng in the first place could have left us in a position where we would now have 30 years of research and medical data on it&#039;s long term neurotoxicity).&nbsp; <br /><br />The DEA was out to harm the very people it claims to protect, because they must be high themselves to think that any recreational user of MDMA gave/gives a fuck what classification it was given, and the potential gains we could have achieved by now by listening to their own judge and making it Sched. II, instead of throwing him off the bench and enacting an illegal piece of legislature (because the emergency scheduling act doesn&#039;t have to go through the house or senate (which breaches your constitution), it&#039;s like having an infinite bullet cheat in call of duty lol) incalculably valuable data on MDMA by now.&nbsp; To prevent people from catching on and making efforts to putting a stop to them passing this legislature a number of very isolated cases of exotic drug abuses were sensationalized beginning in 1983, Rohypnol being one of them.&nbsp; It worked ... because everyone focused on these scary drugs, and nobody bothered to care about the boring legal mumbo jumbo (when they should have !!!)<br /><br />If some asshole want&#039;s to date rape a woman, he only needs to split a 40 of tequilla with her and she&#039;ll voluntarily fuck him ... until the next day when she realized that alcohol&#039;s judgement impairing effect&#039;s made her a victim of date rape.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />The vice documentary is a crock of shit.&nbsp; Scopalamine ... the drug we&#039;re talking about here because &#039;devil&#039;s breath&#039; is just a euphemism for the Datura plant is indeed a dirty, harmful deleriant.&nbsp; But is most certainly not a Manchurian Candidate inducing drug.&nbsp; If it were, the US would not have spent billions in MKULTRA trying to find the perfect method of controlling someone&#039;s actions through the use of drugs (which they did not find any legitimate candidate for).&nbsp; You cannot use it to make someone go to an ATM and withdraw all of their money for you, that my friend is an example of SENSATIONALISM in the media.<br /><br />Those black chicks in that documentary must have been high on something too, because prostitutes steal their John&#039;s wallet and belongings all of the time, when he/she is perfectly sober.&nbsp; What&#039;s he going to do, go to the police and say &quot;This prostitute whose services I just purchased stole my shit and i&#039;d like to file a report&#039; ? lol&nbsp; &nbsp;No of course he&#039;s not !<br /><br />What needs to be removed from SR are compounds that have no entheogenic or enactogenic potential at all, and furthermore are extremely potent poisons that have no use in the clandestine manufacture of any drug.&nbsp; I&#039;m not going to paste the link, but there&#039;s potassium cyanide (believe it&#039;s the potassium salt, may be hydrogen cyanide ...) but it don&#039;t matter because all&nbsp; cyanide salts that i know of are extremely potent poisons with absolutely no recreational drug characteristics whatsoever.&nbsp; It&#039;s only use is to commit murder, or in the novel organic synthesis of new organic chemicals (none of which would ever fall into the categories of enactogenic/entheogenic compounds) that may be being seeked out to create .. a new industrial cleaner or something.&nbsp; Yet there&#039;s a listing for it up live right now, and it has no place being here or anywhere where the public can gain access to it.<br /><br />If you really want to bitch, bitch about poison&#039;s being sold on SR, because their sale sullies the entire essence of what almost all (not counting the murderers) silk road user&#039;s want to echo to the world.&nbsp; That&#039;s that ANY DRUG (not poison) can be used safely and not cause medical problems or death and that it&#039;s OUR BODIES, and with the proper education and respect should be allowed to be altered in any way we feel fit to do.&nbsp; It&#039;s mostly a game to withhold the people from gaining power while still saying that they live in a free and democratic state.&nbsp; <br /><br />That&#039;s the only argument the DEA has to ride on right now in it&#039;s ongoing &#039;war on drugs&#039;, and silk road represents a GLOBAL example to the entities that wish to suppress the use of mind altering drugs because of social policies developed in the early 1900&#039;s (because remember in the late 1800&#039;s Coke was given that name because ... IT HAD COCAINE in it !&nbsp; You could also purchase syringes of cocaine or heroin from the SEARS catalog in that period with it&#039;s description of use being for &quot;women to deal with personal women issues (eg. PMS, cramps, etc. etc.).&nbsp; It was also done primarily to curb the influx of Mexican immigration over the border, to demonize black people further, and a number of other things that we now know had no place in being the justification for making a particular drug illegal.&nbsp; Weed was primarily criminalized by the Mormon church in Utah for fuck sakes, because back then the Churches did in fact have more power in many way&#039;s then the evolving federal government.<br /><br />Those Vice reporter&#039;s should be ashamed for propagating misinformation to bolster their penetration in the media, and you should try getting hammered sometime, you&#039;ll see just how potent a simple and LEGAL drug can be in suppressing you&#039;re ability to use rational thought.<br /><br />The gun doesn&#039;t kill the victim mother fucker, the person who pulled the trigger did !

Most people would be making their own poisons if they really wanted to kill someone I think. <br />I agree with the rest of your post though, alcohol is no better than scopolamine, GHB, etc.

				It also is a matter of perspective. Something like potassium cyanide my seem to be poison only to you, but is is a valuable reagent to others. <br /><br />Something considered a date rape drug may be the narcotic of choice for someone else. <br /><br />Chemicals often are like baseball bats: they can serve their purpose perfectly well, but also be&nbsp; used to kill someone. It obviously is illegal to kill someone with a bat, and it is illegal to do so too with any chemical. This has nothing to do with the nature of the chemical or bat, but everything to do with how people apply it. <br />

				Agree with a lot of the points here. Lots of unsubstantiated and/or subjective crap here. <br /><br />Any fellow chemist will agree that a lot of &#039;evil&#039; substances have legitimate purposes. Alcohol, for instance being an acceptable toxin which , due to its ready availability and acceptability doesn&#039;t raise an eyelid anywhere but is vastly more costly to society than even the likes of heroin. <br /><br />Rather than making arbitrary forum posts, just go and educate yourself on toxicology / physiology / chemistry etc. <br /><br />I know people like to hear / read their opinions on forums to get a congratulatory pat on the back from peers, but imo you just look like twits. <br /><br />&nbsp;

				I would love to throw in my two cents here. <br />I have a buddy who lives in a half way house who also loves GHB and devils breath, Due largely to the fact that they are untraceable in a UA. They are both the only way he can safely enjoy himself without going to prison. <br /><br />I feel like SR and DPR have come up with very definitive lines that seem to work great. Obviously anything that is sold on SR could be used for bad. Just as some of the things in your local 7-11 could be used for bad if someone really wanted to. What it comes down to is freedom, plain and simple. Just like&nbsp; with politicians trying to outlaw everything from guns, to 32 ounce sodas. Why do we need someone to tell us that that is bad for us or could be used for bad so there for it is outlawed. I feel like people can make up their own mind. As you can see from this forum alone if you start to outlaw one thing it can easily lead to another and then another. <br /><br />People everyday are out there trying to get laws passed, telling you what you can and cannot have, do, and think and personally I am getting sick of it. <br /><br />I love SR because they give you the freedom to make a decision that is yours, free of smite, criticism, and that has no limits at all. If we were to start limiting the things that people are allowed to sell, then we would be no better then the politicians that tells you what you can and cannot eat, drink, smoke, buy, sell, think, and shoot.

				you&#039;ve been listening to the media too much, alcohol can be a date rape drug how can the government justify selling it on corner stores?<br />I use these so called &quot;date rape&quot; drugs. Rohypnol is by far my favorite benzo and it is very euphoric. <br />GHB helps me sleep. it is by far one of the best sleep aids out there.<br />ketamine? I dont know why the media says ketamine is a date rape drug. I have met hundreds of people who use or used to ketamine and i know alot about ketamine and i have never heard of someone being raped on ketamine and honestly i have trouble understanding how someone would rape somebody with ketamine..<br />What would they do, try to slip a whole gram of ketamine into a drink and then rape them while theyre enjoying their khole? And by the way ketamine is much less active orally than by sniffing, so a 0.1gram sniffed is equal to 0.5 or 1 gram swallowed orallly. So anything drink with 1-2 grams or more of ketamine will taste very nasty

				If by date rape drug you mean GHB, you&#039;re all wet. It&#039;s rohypnol that&#039;s a date rape drug, NOT GHB. This is an old calumny against GHB that was promoted by the FDA, and a lot of people (maybe most) fell for it, even you, OP.<br /><br />GHB was demonized by the FDA (and the DEA) because it was competing directly against established antidepression drugs that were promoted by big pharma, and which the FDA had sanctioned, and we all know how big pharma owns the FDA lock, stock and barrel.<br /><br />So please, inform yourself before posting this kind of comment.<br /><br />goblin

				Whatever you may say, scopolamine is a nasty drug with little to no recreational value (anyone can post a positive report ?) and its use on others can&#039;t be justified under no circumstances.

GHB is a legit drug that people use, though, so as much as the media says it&#039;s the &quot;dare rape drug&quot; I don&#039;t find it convincing.

Even Unisom and benadryl could be used as far as I know. Roophies are tightly regulated in europe mainly because of their recretional value, not because of date-rape. And GHB can also be used as one, but it&#039;s as legit as flunitrazepam. The demonization of GHB and flunitrazepam by the media are pretty comparable.<br />And for cyanide, it&#039;s also sold for people that want to commit suicide. It&#039;s not a murder weapon of choice because it can be revealed in an autopsy, most cyanide is used in suicides. Murderers prefer untraceable poisons.<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=151574.msg1056822#msg1056822">Quote from: chil on April 26, 2013, 04:32 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Whatever you may say, scopolamine is a nasty drug with little to no recreational value (anyone can post a positive report ?) and its use on others can&#039;t be justified under no circumstances.

Not everybody wants to buy that just to slip it into peoples drinks. It really seems like an interesting substance, although dangerous, and its effects are less harsh than those of datura which is why I&#039;m interested in it. Chaos also used it recreationally, and I even saw people inquiring for BZ (a deliriant way more hardcore than scopolamine) for recretional use... Sure the effects are not exactly as enjoyable as morphine but it&#039;s interesting nonetheless.

				The whole point of SR is to allow voluntary interaction between individuals be the foundation of human civilization. So if you don&#039;t want it dont buy it. there are many things in your home right now that can do more damage than the drugs you mentioned. You obviously don&#039;t understand the definition of an open market. A simple prohibition of the a fore mention drug would kill the very meaning of what SR is, Witht hat said, If DPR and the team feel that allowing such drug to be sold on the Road could cause it to be shutdown, I am sure&nbsp; they would do it.

				First of all, DPR is an individual and although he is at the foundation of SR he stands as an entity separate from the Road [when it comes to addressing issues of morals/ethics].<br />Because we can assume that DPR is not himself monitoring every single drug that is posted on the site, and that SR is likely made up of a group of people, we can agree to take DPR as an individual out of this question.<br /><br />So is it moral to have SR allow the trade of drugs used for date rape?<br /><br />We have to look at both&nbsp; a) the entity responsible [in this case SR Marketplace]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b) the effects of the substances [how much harm does it cause]<br /><br />SR is a platform where the trade of illegal substances is made possible through technology. It has at heart anarchist values of freedom and decentralization (whether it effectively decentralizes drug-trade is debatable) and SR has yet to show preference or disdain of any specific substance. As the Road is shown now, it is clear that the goal as far as trade goes is purely to enable it, rather than to control certain substances in order to fulfill an agenda. Therefore, SR as it stands now does not have the ethical standing to censor an illegal substance.<br /><br />Taken in any context, does the drug on its own cause date rape? Or is if often used as a means to facilitate the act of date rape? If we understand this then we also agree that any drug could be used as a means to aid rape, in the same way that they can be used for other recreational purposes. The drug in itself is not the cause of harm, date rape is. Proper harm reduction is not to ban the substance, but to educate those who could be exposed to it. <br /><br /><br />TL;DR - DPR is not responsible. SR don&#039;t have to justify anything. The drug itself is not evil.
