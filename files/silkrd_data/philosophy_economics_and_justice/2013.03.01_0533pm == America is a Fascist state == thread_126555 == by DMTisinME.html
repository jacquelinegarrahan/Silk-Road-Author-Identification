				Title: <strong>America is a Fascist state</strong><br />
				Post by: <strong>DMTisinME</strong> on <strong>March 01, 2013, 05:33 pm</strong>

			<dd class="postbody">
				Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of &quot;need.&quot; The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.<br />&nbsp;<br />4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread<br />domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.<br />&nbsp;<br />5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.<br />&nbsp;<br />6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.<br />&nbsp;<br />7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.<br />&nbsp;<br />8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government&#039;s policies or actions.<br />&nbsp;<br />9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.<br />&nbsp;<br />10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.<br />&nbsp;<br />11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.<br />&nbsp;<br />12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.<br />&nbsp;<br />13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.<br />&nbsp;<br />14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.<br /><br />See any connections?<br /><br />edit: and an article on the subject -- thanks to&nbsp; talawtam and goblin.<br /><br />CLEARNET<br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/24/usa.comment

				To be clear. This is not a description of America but, the principles shared by all fascist states. I did not author it, Dr. Lawrence Britt did. I am merely pointing out how well it fits with the USA.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126555.msg871249#msg871249">Quote from: The Scientist on March 01, 2013, 06:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Most of those characteristics also apply to communist states.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I agree, in fact many states that are also consider themselves democratic or republics could have this applied to them as well. Across the world government is being corruptly misused. There isn&#039;t a single government that is close to &quot;ideal.&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126555.msg871249#msg871249">Quote from: The Scientist on March 01, 2013, 06:49 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><br />If anything, the US is moving moving into totalitarian globalism, with a twist of communism added in.

It&#039;s been gradually growing more corrupt ever since it&#039;s founding and especially since after WWII, which the common population seems to forget or be ignorant of. <br /><br />When you say &quot;an organic cohesive ethnic identity&quot; I think this is true that most people are not necessarily the same ethnically or religiously, but they blindly follow the government in the same manner, so the result is the same.

				Yes, Naomi Wolf wrote the ten points that define what a fascist state is quite some time ago.<br /><br />The thing is, the us is turning into one, no doubt about it, it&#039;s just that it&#039;s a different kind of fascism; it&#039;s been called &quot;friendly fascism&quot;, although I see no friendliness in it. It&#039;s the kind of fascism that is helped by the people of this country being so gaddamn docile and naive, real sheep, you know. I mean, do you see them rising up like the people of Egypt, or Greece or Spain or Iceland have done? <br /><br />No, they just want to know who wins american &#039;idle&#039;, and please pass the beer and pretzels, thank you very much!<br /><br />goblin

				I remember the days when someone would say America is the greatest country in the world and I would actually believe it... sigh. If you have not heard of the NDAA section 1031 aka the indefinate detention act I urge you to do so. I also can not for the life of me remember the name of the software used but in every traffic light camera or street camera, or those cameras on the highway, they all track your movement and store that information in DHS databases. Besides the fact they&#039;re storing every single email text phonecall web activity ect. Makes me wonder what it is they are so afraid of.

The four biggest problems of the USA are nationalism, religion, ignorance and statism.&nbsp; Many Americans think that the USA can do nothing bad, and if you say any thing bad about it you must be an enemy of the country. They come to associate their own personal identity with the identity of their country, and thus any attack on their country is an attack on them. This is of course highly encouraged by the power elite. Seeing flags everywhere is merely the observation of one way in which this tendency of ego merging with nationalism expresses itself. Then of course we have some of the most insanely religious people in the world, only challenged by the middle east. A lot of Americans are happy to just pray about things and they think that their prayers actually get shit done. But that might be a good thing, since a lot of the religious nutjobs are mostly interested in oppressing homosexuals, oppressing drug users, oppressing other religions and generally trying to use the government to enforce their outdated and insane and baseless idea of morality onto the world. Then we have the ignorant people, they are one of the biggest risks of all. You know, the people who think they are experts on subjects that they don&#039;t know god damn anything about. The people who say &#039;omg don&#039;t take LSD it makes you go insane!!!111&#039; , and who are willing to argue this point to the end , regardless of the proof shown to them. Actually ignorant isn&#039;t even the appropriate word for them, in reality they are more similar to mindless drones. They are like the worker ants who mindlessly and unquestioningly serve the queen. If the government says something they just take it to be true. And of course this is similar to the ultra statists, a lot of them have been completely brainwashed by the total illusion that we live in a democracy. &quot;IF YOU DON&#039;T LIKE THE LAW THEN CHANGE IT BUT THE LAW IS THE LAW!!!11&#039; types. You know, the guy who says &quot;Yeah, I mean I am all for LSD being legalized, but like , the law is the law man, so I support the police still!&quot;. These people are the some of the most disgusting humans in existence and I hope that a law is passed saying that they must all kill themselves. Unfortunately they make up a huge amount of the population.<br /><br />So that leaves us with good old USA, a country with an enormous population of hyper-nationalistic hyper-religious retards who mindlessly follow and support the laws of their masters.

				ah yes! trapwire, that&#039;s it. I couldn&#039;t remember that for the life of me. Everytime I drive down the highway with my friends I always point out the cameras overhead about every 5 minutes. My friends think it&#039;s funny, I think it&#039;s disgusting. Also you guys should check out Operation Stellar Wind. That is the DHS&#039;s warehouse that stores every citizen&#039;s well.... anything. It gets stored indefinately incase they ever need to use it against you. So much for life, liberty, and FREEDOM. btw everyone else&#039;s posts in here are so articulate it makes me feel like a dummy :0

Every time I hear this I want to jump up and down on their heads.<br /><br />This is the most thought-stopping kind of utterance, the people who say this don&#039;t stop for a second to consider what they&#039;re actually permitting by saying this: today it may just be the &quot;bad guys&quot; who will get it, but tomorrow it will definitely be EVERYBODY. Once these things start, the slippery slope is unstoppable. And it&#039;s happening to everyone anyway already.<br /><br />Like with the drones; kill americuns in Yemen (even a minor like Abdel-Rahman Al Alawki). From that to killing them here in the land of the &quot;free&quot; it&#039;s just a skip and a jump, baby. And anyway, the constitution protects both americuns and those of any other nationality from extra-judicial punishment, to say nothing of execution. This is illegal under both americun and international law.<br /><br />goblin

Very true about the combination of the ego and the nationalist expression. A good majority of people, especially those in America, have no actual personality, it is just a combination of things they steal from mass media, other people&#039;s sayings, and like you say: the government. People are really devoid of an actual personality, and are drones. This reminds me of a quote from the movie, God Bless America: <br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m done, really, everything is so &quot;cool&quot; now. I just want it all to stop. I mean, nobody talks about anything anymore. They just regurgitate everything they see on TV, or hear on the radio or watch on the web. When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone without somebody texting or looking at a screen or a monitor over your head? You know, a conversation about something that wasn&#039;t celebrities, gossip, sports, or pop politics. You know, something important, something personal.&quot; <br /><br />Pretty ironic that to prove my point, I myself, regurgitate something from the mass media. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126555.msg872552#msg872552">Quote from: kmfkewm on March 02, 2013, 07:59 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Then we have the ignorant people, they are one of the biggest risks of all.

The law is the law shit is just typical mindless obedience. I like Thomas Jefferson&#039;s quote, &quot;If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so.&quot; This is very true, because how else can we clearly express it is unjust? Through elections predetermined by corporations? By talking on corporate owned mass media platforms? This country needs mass non-violent protest, but those ignorant people just think, &quot;everything in front of my eyes looks fine to me, so it must all be good. Why would I protest it?&quot; or they are those who will support the ideal that the US is best no matter what happens.<br /><br />&nbsp;In order to end the cycle of mindless droning we need to do something about our education or more accurately named &quot;indoctrination&quot; system. Kids are told not to ask &quot;why?&quot; Just do as you are told, we are smarter than you because we know how to navigate the world ignorant of it&#039;s troubles. It depresses me how innocent &amp; uncorrupted a child&#039;s mind is, then we force upon him what WE consider right and wrong, instead of them deciding for themselves. I think that we will collapse because in the way that evolution was successful because of the vast differences let us constantly survive by not putting &quot;all our chips on the same hand,&quot; we have essentially done just that, by becoming the same, and believing the same things, becoming the same people. It&#039;s easy to have trouble remembering people nowadays, they&#039;re all so damn alike. What happened to personality and uniqueness? The government and the media took those traits away from us, and I think that that suggests more than anything else, that we are becoming a fascist, one-stance-fits-all state.

				It&#039;s going to be very damaging to the psyche of these nationalist drones when America becomes an also-ran on the world stage.<br /><br />I also get tired of these ignorant people you describe. What&#039;s that saying? &quot;A little knowledge in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing.&quot;<br />You get these idiots who think because they&#039;ve spent endless hours &quot;researching&quot; on the internet to uncover the &quot;real truth&quot;, that they&#039;re somehow privy to how the world really works. They have so much of their personal identities invested in what they believe all critical reasoning goes out the window, any piece of information they come across that adds weight to their dogma is accepted unquestioningly, alternatively when faced with a mass of opposing ideas or information these are quickly cast aside or derogatorily labeled as one of their opposing ideology&#039;s. Any discussion with these irrational, closed minded individuals quickly descends into a black or white, &quot;your either with us or against us&quot; (or even more ironic; the &quot;your blinkered to what&#039;s really going on&quot;) level of argument, where all rational and logical reasoning has disappeared along with any chance to gain knowledge or wisdom and ultimately grow as human beings.<br /><br />Rant over, back on-topic: No, America currently is not a fascist state and most of those points are far too general to be indicative of fascist state.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Give details. And no, you should not be proud of any achievement that you personally did not have a hand in accomplishing. Just because you were born in a certain place doesn&#039;t mean you helped that place accomplish whatever their achievement was. As for being liberal, I think we in this topic are advocating for being &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;left-wing&quot; in regards to human rights. I don&#039;t think much about actual economic policy has been said in this thread, which is where your whole Marxist point would come in. If you must know, under your terms, I would be very &quot;left-wing&quot; in regards to rights, and very &quot;right-wing&quot; in regards to spending and economics. A libertarian of sorts, but I hate to define myself, especially to any sort of political party -- they are the brainwashing scum of America.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126555.msg878721#msg878721">Quote from: anonymouse23 on March 04, 2013, 10:10 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126555.msg877047#msg877047">Quote from: DMTisinME on March 03, 2013, 10:54 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=126555.msg877001#msg877001">Quote from: anonymouse23 on March 03, 2013, 10:29 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal. ;)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Legality ≠ morality<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was hinting at how the government takes away our rights and limits our freedom without most people even noticing it. ;)<br />Surly not a fan of Hitler.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was supporting your statement.&nbsp; ;)
