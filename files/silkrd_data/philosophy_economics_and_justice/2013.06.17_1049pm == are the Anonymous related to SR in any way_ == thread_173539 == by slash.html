				I will refer to wikipedia to explain this as easily as possible because this is a big misconception about &quot;anonymous&quot;<br />&quot;&quot;Anonymous&quot; is not a defined group of people, but rather a name used by any &quot;hacktivist&quot; if they believe their goals align with the loosely defined interests of Anonymous.&quot;<br />So in a way yes. But mostly no.

				ANON is a social trend among hackers. Mostly, it&#039;s just a farce, in which from time to time, rogue hackers attack corporate villains (so easy to make any corporation out to be an antagonist) or CP sites, but essentially have a positive effect on their &quot;victims&quot;--by revealing security weaknesses in networks, firewalls, etc., or by using newly developed software innovations.<br /><br />No, they are not in any way related to SR. Please don&#039;t insult SR users.

				In order to join Anonymous all you have to do is WANT to be a member. If DPR wants to be an Anon then DPR is Anon.<br /><br />All youhave to do in order to join Anonymous is never tell anyone youre a member. ;)

				From what I can see SR is an genuine community of by and large outside-the-box types whereas anybody identifying themselves with this group &quot;Anonymous&quot; always looks and sounds like a mouthpiece of black propaganda, that is, sneakily promoting the agenda of the new world order boys all the while appearing to be on the side of the people and I would love to see a video of one of those snakes unmasked and decapitated&nbsp; &nbsp;

				Anonymous started out in 2003 or so as a joke. Stage dramatic and gigantic pranks on the interwebz in order to show everybody how ridiculous they are for taking the internet seriously in the first place. Often, said very serious people were calling for censorship and regulations of free communities and speech, so the solution became to troll these authoritarian assholes until they gave up and disappeared back to obscurity. <br /><br />The over-the-top ridiculous and threatening WE ARE LEGION memes that were created around 2004 described petty forum raids and fucking around in games like Second Life with raining dongs on players and Ft. Longcat, the hidden fortress no server admin could remove, and were purposely propaganda-like for maximum lulz. This continues spreading cacophony and anarchism until the media eventually picked it up creating the timeless classic of exploding vans on fox news to describe the super seekrit underworld of anon as the final boss of the internet when in reality it was just crowd sourced anarchy for entertainment at this point. <br /><br />Shortly after /i/nvasion was in full swing and blackhats looking for lulz would drop their exploits they had finished using for profit on the board, to see what lulz would come out of it. Like targeting Facebook pity party memorials. We also dropped endless cracked DBs of passwords on to /b/ to see if any of them would work on Facebook or Linkedin, unleashing thousands of /b/tards to go on there and impersonate users logging into their accounts with often hilarious outcome. <br /><br />The &quot;we never forgive/never forget&quot; was thought up by a group of /b/tards on IRC when we used to stream cheeze episodes of Star Trek back in like 2005 and make fun of First officer Beard trying to hit on everything in sight. We&#039;d watch this and Hackers the movie high out of minds in the trollbox chat beside the stream waiting to harass Tom Green and other live call in shows. There&#039;s a scene in DS9 or TNG, where the Klingon commander guy (gowron? can&#039;t remember) screams to the camera AND FOR THIS WE NEVER FORGET, OR FORGIVE and it&#039;s hilarious how he says it. <br /><br />I think about 6,000+ stoned and drunk btards repeated that over and over for the next month and then it started appearing in the call to action propaganda crowd sourcing ads, so now you know where that came from. <br /><br />Then the scientology thing happened, and people were actually wearing masks and IRL protesting, which to us who were around since the beginning seemed faggot-tree to the max as the whole premise was an inside joke, not an actual real movement, though it was fun to punch scientology straight in the balls and to watch random idiots dressing up as rick astley and dancing on scilon tables while dodging security. <br /><br />Then the white knights, super-serial activists and general facebook/reddit TOP LEL lamer crowd got into it when adbusters called for Occupy wallstreet and it was completely ruined as way as lulz go. By this point the FBI was after everybody and it just exploded into a regular protest movement worldwide so I exited stage left.<br /><br />Facebook crowd generally ruins everything. If you have a Santarchy/Santacon, a zombie walk, anything cacophonist in your city it will be completely overrun with Joe Normal and his boring girlfriend who have zero sense of humor and are wild on the weekend corporate accountants. Or by complete douchebags, like the Love Parade in Germany which originally was awesome then became a failed bunch of aggro fuckheads.

The aggro brostep douches showed up way before that happened. <br /><br />You can still go... to the Fuck parade. It was created by some of the original Love Parade organizers who didn&#039;t want anything to do with commercialism, hence the name. They figure no sponsors for FUCK PARADE so haven&#039;t had nearly the same problems as the Love Parade with gigantic facebook douchebag turnout. If you remember the infamous Techno Viking video he was at a fuck parade.

That were some terrible German captions. ;)<br />I knew the fuck parade back in the loveparade days, but at that time it was not worthy of even mentioning because it was just an bunch of people. I would really like to have these Berlin Siegessäule pictures back with a million people or so, It looked to awesome on TV.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;I know no one is going to believe this, but I posted something a few years back in a forum, <br />&nbsp;about how this local politician was fighting marijuana decriminalization because <br />he has bunch of friends who are licensed treatment providers, and<br />&nbsp;label kids as &quot;addicts&quot; for smoking pot, and milk the government<br />for millions of dollars, making money off of this bullshit law.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, his whole family got Dox&#039;d by Lulzsec.&nbsp; Could be a coincidence, then again, maybe not. <br />&nbsp; I don&#039;t really blame people for wearing Guy Fawkes masks, given the police state here<br />in the US, but its silly, and they will only take away our right to wear them given enough<br />time.&nbsp; I support ANON, proudly.&nbsp; We can&#039;t even protest anymore without being taped,<br />cell-logged and geotag&#039;d.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, find a better mask, maybe Jason? Blowing up parliament<br />for the sake of catholicism is not the best image when the gov&#039;t has been using a terrorist<br />&nbsp;scare tactic to destroy our future for 12 years, the banking crisis is a symptom of the <br />broken system that has bankrupted the US.&nbsp; If they had just come out during OWS, and demanded<br />an end to the GWOT instead of making out every banker to be a criminal, we&#039;d be a lot further<br />than we are now.&nbsp; &nbsp;Still, fuck the man, he deserves every hack fired his way.
