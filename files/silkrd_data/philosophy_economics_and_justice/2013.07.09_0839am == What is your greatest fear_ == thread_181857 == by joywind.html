				My greatest fear is solipsism.

Your friends, your loved ones, the outside world etc. are all illusions in reality. The only real thing is your consciousness and you cannot be sure of anything else. You cannot separate the seen from the seer, so everything that&#039;s not the seer is an illusion in definitive, it&#039;s not real (for what it concern the fact that you can be SURE it exists).<br /><br />But the point is that it doesn&#039;t really matter. On the contrary knowing this should give you liberty and freedom, because you understand that life is a theater and you are an actor in it, and this will give you the power to turn a possible tragedy in a comedy and enjoy what&#039;s happening to the most. In definitive it doesn&#039;t matter anything at all if your friends, your loved ones etc. exist or not, it just matters if you enjoy the illusion or not.<br /><br />If you do, then enjoy it to the most, and if you don&#039;t, just turn the eyes somewhere else and immerse yourself into another kind of illusion.

				The whack thought processes that many powerful individuals and others who influence geo-political forces run thru before making retarded decisions that would be funnier than a circus clown - if they were even funny. Not really a fear, because large communities have some good pull for decision making, although at the large scale over the last few years, failure to find common ground between varying political ideologies has shown the stupid and aggressive side of humanity. <br /><br />We&#039;re animals without societal expectations at least in basic terms, and the thought that a common civility can&#039;t often be found between several religions and cultures is irrational, but irrational thoughts, unsupported by solid facts can help us thru the most disturbing events in our lives. Stay strong minded and true to your principles. Don&#039;t; then I fear YOU, Punk Ass Muthafucka!<br /><br />I&#039;m stoned trying to keep to the topic, but I have a question for scammers (actually, no. People with ethics that know the tru side of a smirking dickhead screwing normal people because they think their lying is cleaver and manipulating. So to stay on topic, my fear changed to unethical scammers in big industry and lone douchebaggery BS. How do we exterminate this problem?

				I don&#039;t think an eternity of non-existence is anything to fear though....IF that is what death is.&nbsp; &nbsp;We won&#039;t be conscious for it, so it&#039;s not like we are going to be sitting in a pitch dark room twiddling our thumbs for eternity.....conscious of our boredom.&nbsp; &nbsp;It will be like sleeping...or it will be nothing (like being knocked out for surgery).&nbsp; &nbsp; Either way, it&#039;s nothing to worry about or fear.&nbsp; It just is what it is.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We&#039;re all going to the same place...so it will be like a big, unconscious mind-meld in the sky.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No sweat.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8)

				One of my greatest fears is being put in a situation where I cannot procure drugs of any kind.&nbsp; Societal collapse of some kind where Internet access goes out via widespread electricity failure and sabotage.&nbsp; Mail service is cut off or scaled back due to the skyrocketing cost of gasoline or the government&#039;s inability to pay postal workers...back to horseback parcel delivery.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ground transportation comes to a screeching halt, borders and Customs offices are closed due to emergency conditions.&nbsp; &nbsp;Street dealers quickly run out of stock b/c they cannot be resupplied.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of sudden, you are forced to rely on extremely local hook-ups or be self-sufficient by creating your own drug supply.&nbsp; However, due to dramatic shifts in the climate or nuclear contamination, no vegetation can grow anymore or be consumed.&nbsp; So opium poppies and ganja become out of the question.....anyway, the remaining marijuana plants in the ground are immediately dug up and used for hemp products....since we can no longer import cheap clothing from China.&nbsp; &nbsp;Opium poppies are all yanked out of the ground b/c of global morphine shortages from mass casualties and civilian injuries resulting from a multitude of regional wars breaking out over dwindling natural resources.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chemicals used in meth and pharmaceutical labs are confiscated and used by our military and emergency responders because of major shortages due to the global emergency at hand.&nbsp; &nbsp;All of a sudden, wondering how we get our next meal and protecting our home and family from looting and roving militias becomes a higher priority than drug seeking recreational amusement.&nbsp; The party is over.&nbsp; Sobriety sucks.&nbsp; &nbsp; ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;Smoke &#039;em while ya got &#039;em.&nbsp; &nbsp;8)&nbsp; &nbsp;And stock up&nbsp; while the getting is good...three years worth of your drug of choice in an underground bunker, like the Mormons do with food.&nbsp; &nbsp; ;D&nbsp; &nbsp;

				I&#039;m surprised when people put &quot;failing&quot; as their greatest fear.&nbsp; Failing is a part of life, and a great learning experience.&nbsp; I know there is no right answer to the question &quot;what is your greatest fear?&quot;&nbsp; but -failure- seems like a lame answer.&nbsp; &nbsp;It also doesn&#039;t seem realistic.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Ever tried.

				Well I wouldn&#039;t be too hard on yourself.&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; I am very skeptical about the reality of &quot;true love.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s likely just a myth.&nbsp; &nbsp;:o&nbsp; &nbsp;I think there are many, many people out there who we could be compatible with.&nbsp; &nbsp;It causes me to be skeptical of monogamy itself.&nbsp; &nbsp; :P&nbsp; &nbsp;Are men and women -really- supposed to only be with one mate throughout their lifetimes....that actually doesn&#039;t seem to comport with our natural instincts, human nature, or even what we see in the wild.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />The fact that you unconsciously try to sabotage relationships before they bloom into something truly meaningful seems fairly typical.&nbsp; It&#039;s a self-defense mechanism...to keep from being hurt when the relationship eventually crumbles, and also to provide a WAY OUT of a relationship...by acting badly, we almost force the other person to kick us to the curb.&nbsp; This helps the ego too, b/c we end up rationalizing the break-up as the fault of the other person...&quot;well, she was the one who kicked me out, I loved her and wanted to be with her....blah blah.&quot;&nbsp; But really we&#039;re just forcing her hand by acting out.&nbsp; &nbsp; At least this is how it&#039;s always worked out in my relationships... so maybe I&#039;m just psychologically skewed.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;::) ;)&nbsp; &nbsp;

When some of your biggest fears already came true, when you&#039;ve got nothing left to lose. You won&#039;t be afraid of death anymore.

				My biggest fear is reading through five pages of this thread only to realize I actually didn&#039;t post on here before hahah, but seriously...<br /><br />Infinite time seems very scary, because on a deep shroom trip I feel like I experienced that and it scared the fuck out of me.<br /><br />I used to be scared of the after life, but through psychedelics I now look forward to it... Just not anytime soon lol<br />I used to be scared that when we died everything went black and there was nothing, no me, no consciousness. Then I thought, well shit if that happens I won&#039;t have to worry about it because my existence will be gone only leaving behind my impressions I left on individuals on that strange rock I lived on floating through space. <br />Then I thought, okay what if there is a heaven... I&#039;m not talking catholic type heaven having to obey the commandments and shit. But I believe that if there is a heaven that as long as you are a genuine good person you should be straight. And yeah I&#039;ve made some bad decisions in my life, but I strive to be a good person. I hope that counts. <br /><br />I&#039;m scared of not being able to protect my family when they need protected. I exercise my second amendment rights to carry a gun, but what if I&#039;m not around to help them. I&#039;m scared of losing my mind. I&#039;ve lost my mind on intense trips and through all the blur I remember some aspects of it and if I lost my mind for good that would blow.<br /><br />But honestly my greatest fear is getting raped pulp fiction style in the basement of a pawn shop.<br /><br />~Psychedelic
