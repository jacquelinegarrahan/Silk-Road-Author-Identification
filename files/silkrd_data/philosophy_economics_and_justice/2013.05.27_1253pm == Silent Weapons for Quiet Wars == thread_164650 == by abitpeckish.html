				motek mentioned a link in a separate thread linked below. I was intrigued, so I dug a little deeper. Here&#039;s is what I&#039;m finding, I thought it was worth discussing.<br /><br />http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=157173.msg1165960#msg1165960<br /><br />---<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: motek</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://www.whale.to/b/silentweapon.html</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />[top - Energy]<br /><br />So this is a fantastic movie plot, I&#039;ll grant you. They&#039;ve have thrown a heady mix of nostalgia, historical context, anachronistically modern linguistics (&quot;social automation systems&quot;), and language suggesting specific audience targets (conspiracists, cryptoanarchists), and it has already begun to froth. I do believe one of the broadest strokes, social programming is possible, is true. Information clearly changes us, at least in a very general but still influential way. I&#039;m just not sure I can believe that any organization would have recognized this capability and been able to exploit it for very long. The sheer amount of technological advancement needed to exercise social control would itself limit the ability to do so. The requirements for significant control are such that attempting to meet those requirements draws us into a deepening hierarchy of sub-requirements. Basically, as you attempt to build the technology and systems needed to control society, you are constantly changing the society being controlled and therefore the parameters of your goal. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science, theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary energy science. And the bookkeeper can be king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Pause. We have been fed some bullshit. We are being subliminally fed at least the following things:<br /><br />1. An extremely narrow definition of &quot;social science&quot;<br />2. An extremely reductionist interpretation of economics as being mathematics, weakly implying elementary simplicity<br />3. A declaration that that &quot;math = primary energy science&quot; that stands upon these narrow definitions and reductions<br /><br />There are shades of truth to this, but it is clear that the direction in which our attention is being pointed is not itself true.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Beyond this remains only one issue: # Who will be the beneficiary? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here&#039;s the setup of what will clearly be a fundamental piece of the story. There are just so many conclusions packed into this line, it is propagandistic. This is the kind of thing we need to teach people to recognize. Here&#039;s where a trap for your mind is being set:<br /><br />1. &quot;All science is merely a means to an end.&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- hmmm, seems a little...inflexible.<br />2. &quot;The end is control&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- this is a perversion of what science is and does. the end of science is to improve upon its means, i.e. knowledge. full stop. The purpose of science is to gain knowledge and then use that knowledge to gain more knowledge.<br />3. Therefore, the only valid question is &quot;Who will be the beneficiary?&quot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- since the premise of control is not necessary, universal, or even all that valid, this is not the &quot;only&quot; valid question<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It remains to be seen whether this document acknowledges the horrific illogic being attributed to the &quot;International Elite&quot; or simply coopts it. Let&#039;s continue our reading.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern. Although the so-called &quot;moral issues&quot; were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here is the feared consequence of science, laid bare. That if man were to do this to itself, it would somehow be a rational act. One of the requirements of science is to objectify everything. When one does this, it is clear that acting upon such narrowly articulated beliefs would be absolutely immoral due to the fact that it makes no sense for the overarching objects. These would be humanity, all life on earth, etc. The best and brightest among us are simply not going to allow themselves to operate on the notion that &quot;some were selected and some weren&#039;t&quot;. The most powerful among us can do much through brute force alone, but can accomplish very little without those best and brightest.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace, and tranquillity, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Even if this were true, it is not logical or reasonable for those few to believe that they could maintain this self-discipline in secrecy for any significant period of time. In fact, it is not logical or reasonable for those few to decide to operate in secret at all.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public appearance as to earn for themselves the name &quot;silent weapons.&quot; </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Again some solid literary prowess. I am simply aching to know what these weapons are, and the author(s) keeps building it up. But I have to point something out here...isn&#039;t this supposed to be a &quot;Technical Manual&quot;? I&#039;ve never read technical documentation quite like this.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">In order to achieve a totally predictable economy, the low-class elements of society must be brought under total control, i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social duties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of the matter. In order to achieve such conformity, the lower-class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents and the establishment of government-operated day-care centers for the occupationally orphaned children. <br /><br />The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essential to maintain some measure of social order, peace, and tranquillity for the ruling upper class. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Okay, we&#039;ve gone off the rails. Predicting an economy &quot;totally&quot;, &quot;total control&quot;, &quot;housebroken&quot;, &quot;slavery&quot;. You are being programmed when you read this kind of shit, the entire setup is geared toward getting you to believe crazier and crazier things. The very next section lays out the basic concept what of social control weapon &quot;doesn&#039;t&quot; look like, begins to introduce a very thin bankster/oilco thread, and calls the use of the weapon &quot;biological warfare.&quot; <br /><br />---<br /><br />I&#039;m going to finish this story in pieces throughout the day, but it is no longer worth my attention at this moment. Again I will state that there is probably much truth hiding in this story you&#039;ve linked, motek, but it&#039;s already apparent that this document is inexorably mired in unreason. As such, I sense a danger in presenting stories like these to people who have not thrown yoke of unreason from off their backs. Perhaps it will make people think more critically, but it seems to me that more often stories like these just make people believe crazy shit.

				Theoretical Introduction<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Give me control over a nation&#039;s currency, and I care not who makes its laws.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; -- Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1743 - 1812) <br /><br />Today&#039;s silent weapons technology is an outgrowth of a simple idea discovered, succinctly expressed, and effectively applied by the quoted Mr. Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Mr. Rothschild discovered the missing passive component of economic theory known as economic inductance. He, of course, did not think of his discovery in these 20th-century terms, and, to be sure, mathematical analysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Revolution, the rise of the theory of mechanics and electronics, and finally, the invention of the electronic computer before it could be effectively applied in the control of the world economy. <br />========================================================================================================================================<br />Descriptive Introduction of the Silent Weapon<br />Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning.<br /><br />It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing, instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data, instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking magnate, instead of a military general.<br /><br />It makes no obvious explosive noises, causes no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone&#039;s daily social life.<br /><br />Yet it makes an unmistakable &quot;noise,&quot; causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and unmistakably interferes with the daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for.<br /><br />The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.<br /><br />The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but that is because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend themselves against it.<br /><br />When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up.<br /><br />Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses. <br />========================================================================================================================================<br />Historical Introduction<br />Silent weapon technology has evolved from Operations Research (O.R.), a strategic and tactical methodology developed under the Military Management in England during World War II. The original purpose of Operations Research was to study the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defense with the objective of effective use of limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e., logistics).<br /><br />It was soon recognized by those in positions of power that the same methods might be useful for totally controlling a society. But better tools were necessary.<br /><br />Social engineering (the analysis and automation of a society) requires the correlation of great amounts of constantly changing economic information (data), so a high-speed computerized data-processing system was necessary which could race ahead of the society and predict when society would arrive for capitulation.<br /><br />Relay computers were to slow, but the electronic computer, invented in 1946 by J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill.<br /><br />The next breakthrough was the development of the simplex method of linear programming in 1947 by the mathematician George B. Dantzig.<br /><br />Then in 1948, the transistor, invented by J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain, and W. Shockley, promised great expansion of the computer field by reducing space and power requirements.<br /><br />With these three inventions under their direction, those in positions of power strongly suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole world with the push of a button.<br /><br />Immediately, the Rockefeller Foundation got in on the ground floor by making a four-year grant to Harvard College, funding the Harvard Economic Research Project for the study of the structure of the American Economy. One year later, in 1949, The United States Air Force joined in.<br /><br />In 1952 the grant period terminated, and a high-level meeting of the Elite was held to determine the next phase of social operations research. The Harvard project had been very fruitful, as is borne out by the publication of some of its results in 1953 suggesting the feasibility of economic (social) engineering. (Studies in the Structure of the American Economy - copyright 1953 by Wassily Leontief, International Science Press Inc., White Plains, New York).<br /><br />Engineered in the last half of the decade of the 1940&#039;s, the new Quiet War machine stood, so to speak, in sparkling gold-plated hardware on the showroom floor by 1954.<br /><br />With the creation of the maser in 1954, the promise of unlocking unlimited sources of fusion atomic energy from the heavy hydrogen in sea water and the consequent availability of unlimited social power was a possibility only decades away.<br /><br />The combination was irresistible.<br /><br />The Quiet War was quietly declared by the International Elite at a meeting held in 1954.<br /><br />Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later, the evolution of the new weapon-system has never suffered any major setbacks.<br /><br />This volume marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the Quiet War. Already this domestic war has had many victories on many fronts throughout the world. <br /><br /><br />========================================================================================================================================<br />Summary<br />The people hire the politicians so that the people can:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; obtain security without managing it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; obtain action without thinking about it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; inflict theft, injury, and death upon others without having to contemplate either life or death.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; avoid responsibility for their own intentions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; obtain the benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in the discipline of facing or learning either of these things. <br /><br />They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine to:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; provide for the survival of the nation/womb.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; prevent encroachment of anything upon the nation/womb.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; destroy the enemy who threatens the nation/womb.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; destroy those citizens of their own country who do not conform for the sake of stability of the nation/womb. <br /><br />Politicians hold many quasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the attorneys and C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed), and the judges who shout orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals are industrialists. The &quot;presidential&quot; level of commander-in-chief is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have created this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite.<br /><br />Thus, a nation becomes divided into two very distinct parts, a docile sub-nation [great silent majority] and a political sub-nation. The political sub-nation remains attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent.<br />System Analysis<br />In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war, the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical values to each element of the war structure - personnel and material alike.<br /><br />This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsystems of such a structure.<br />The Draft (As military service)<br /><br /><br /><br />========================================================================================================================================<br />The Draft (As military service)<br />Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the government is omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill.<br /><br />Even more interesting is the process by which a young man&#039;s parents, who purportedly love him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death. Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in a computer analysis of social and war systems.<br /><br />We begin with a tentative definition of the draft.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The draft (selective service, etc.) is an institution of compulsory collective sacrifice and slavery, devised by the middle-aged and elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational Stabilizer). It is marketed and and sold to the public under the label of &quot;patriotic = national&quot; service.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory. The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother&#039;s instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing his resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for a banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical models (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least to predeterminate these events with maximum certainty. What does not exist by natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings are machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is little real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table of Human Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in true measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presently inflated beyond the production of national goods and services so as to give the economy a false kinetic energy (&quot;paper&quot; inductance).<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount with a gram of silver today as it could be bought in 1920. Human value measured in silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Enforcement<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Factor I<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in every social system approach, stability is achieved only by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction patterns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in other human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive) is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Factor II - Father<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The man of the household must be housebroken to ensure that junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes. The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorable behavior.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a backbone) will slam a gun into junior&#039;s hand before father will risk the censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose not withstanding. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Factor III - Mother<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man&#039;s cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition to &quot;reality&quot; when it comes, or sooner.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the transition becomes more difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated, and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers must be become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory). Caution: A woman&#039;s impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman&#039;s power must never be underestimated, and her power over a pussy-whipped husband must likewise never be underestimated. It got women the vote in 1920. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Factor IV - Junior<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The emotional pressure for self-preservation during the time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the battlefield - if junior can be persuaded to go - is all of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Their quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: &quot;No sacrifice, no friends; no glory, no girlfriends.&quot; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Factor V - Sister<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what about junior&#039;s sister? She is given all the good things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from her future husband regardless of the price. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Factor VI - Cattle<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those who will not use their brains are no better off than those who have no brains, and so this mindless school of jelly-fish, father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers of the same. <br />========================================================================================================================================<br /><br />The above is about 5% of the document in question<br /><br />m m m motek
