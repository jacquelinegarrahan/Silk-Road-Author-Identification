				I am shocked that nobody posted this yet. Confirms what we all probably believed to be true about the US gov&#039;ts collection of online data. <br /><br />Here are the articles (both on clearnet): http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html<br /><br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/<br /><br /><br />Now I really am probably going to start doing 90 percent of my browsing on Tor.

				Oh I&#039;ve been right on top this. <br /><br />Those who watch any TV news, will be misdirected by some &quot;Sudden Random Shooting&quot; that always happens to come along when the O admin needs it. <br /><br />With the many scandals unfolding, and being folded back up, just imagine WHAT WE DON&quot;T KNOW ABOUT !!!<br /><br />Want the news? - go to drudgereport.com&nbsp; <br /><br />They link to news stories from all over the world, going outside the Government Media Complex of the US.

Though I can skip along and get the gist of it. Ever listen to Coasttocoastam? It&#039;s on most every night starting at 12 or 1am, and ending at 5a. US Eastern. They cover all different alternative answers to things that are popular, yet scoffed at by the &#039;mid-stream-media&quot;. <br /><br />They&#039;ll do UFO&#039;s some nights, and yes even a Sasqwatch show, but some of the guests he has on, especially in regard to the secret societies that pull the strings of the marionettes we think we elect, are most compelling. It all goes in line with this sort of thing. <br /><br />Check it out, if you haven&#039;t already. - You don&#039;t need a tin-foil hat ;)

				You know I didn&#039;t really wanna say anything about this but I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m not the only one that&#039;s hand about enough of hearing the war on terror excuse. <br /><br />Govt: Hey sorry we&#039;re going to tap your phones and monitor all your internet activity so we can win the war on terror.<br /><br />You: ummm Ok <br /><br />Govt: We also think it would be a swell idea to put a GPS device on your car or on second thought how about we just implant in your body while your sleeping? You know those terrorists are sneaky we can&#039;t let them win the war and you gotta do your part as an American!<br /><br />You: That&#039;s fucked up but ok for my country I&#039;ll do it.<br /><br />Govt: After a long meeting with a congress we just had a stunning revelation. The oldest daughter of each family will come to Congress in order for our Senators to impregnate them to ensure our evil tyrannically bloodlines will live on and continue to oppress the people and shit all over the Consititution. Oh almost forgot this is to fight the war on terror also!<br /><br />You: Sure why not? Nothing left of my dignity anyways.<br /><br />Welcome to America the biggest hypocritical country on the planet that tells more lies than a $20 hooker hooked on meth. Watch as the masses sit ideally by as each one of their rights get stripped and taken away from them until one day the realization that they no longer live in a democracy.<br /><br />&nbsp;A Government is supposed to protect their people. Instead everyone sits around to afraid to speak the truth about our fascist Government. You think this is a democracy? You&#039;re wrong. It&#039;s not anymore. If only Lincoln could see his great America now. I&#039;m sure this is not what he had envisioned. A Government that spies on it&#039;s people and violates almost every law in the constitution in the name of &#039;The War on Terror&#039;. <br /><br />

				&nbsp;&quot;Now it&#039;s 1984 - knockin&#039;, knockin&#039; at your front door&quot;...<br /><br />Ah it appears I&#039;ve found my way to right the place. Ah the things we can share. You know when I first found myself navigating my way around the TOR network I was immediately struck by the notion that this is the place for most &quot;truth seekers&quot; to dwell. It&#039;s just unfortunately I&#039;m yet to find any onions at all that even covers this sort of stuff. So far all I&#039;ve found TOR to be associated with is a) the black market (no qualms from me), b) child porn (ALOT of qualms from me), c) a bunch of dead-links and d) nothing really at all. <br /><br />Given the fact that TOR was established as a medium for the citizens of heavily censored countries to get the chance to piggy-back their way to uncensored / unfiltered information and also communicate I can&#039;t believe there&#039;s nothing that covers this ground. Or at least I haven&#039;t found any hidden services that provide this sort of information. <br /><br /><br />The NSA answers to nobody. If they&#039;ve got the ability to kill the president of USA and have the WHOLE WORLD not even suspect them of it for 30+ years it&#039;s safe to say that they can do what the fuck the feel like doing. <br /><br />Do you buy much into Bill Cooper&#039;s work jagfug?

				There&#039;s been some really interesting speculation about this online given the impugned companies reactions to this (immediate, direct refutation, rather than silence or weasel words). Maybe they&#039;re simply lying (though it seems like a poor short-term strategy), maybe they&#039;re bound by law not to acknowledge the existence of PRISM (they say they&#039;ve never heard of it). Or maybe the NSA goes direct to cable and skips the companies, or in the guise of computer security consultation (which they do) they&#039;ve installed backdoors without the companies knowing. <br /><br />Today Edward Snowden came forward as the whistleblower. The world owes him a debt of gratitude. I fear for the man.<br /><br />*clearnet*<br /><br />http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance<br /><br />*clearnet*
