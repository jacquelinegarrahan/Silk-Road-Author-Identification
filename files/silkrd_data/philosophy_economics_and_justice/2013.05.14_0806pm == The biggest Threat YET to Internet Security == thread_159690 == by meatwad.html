Before that, in the days when a BBS stood for something more than a PHP app, networks existed far outside of the reach. TOR, even with its government roots, shares with it some of those principals. There will always be bills and attempts at reducing the rights of the open web. Always. This is unavoidable, and for the most part its there so that companies, conglomerates, and business alliances, have a happy warm feeling in the morning that they think they&#039;ve stuck it to us.<br /><br />The internet is only special in that many networks have agreed to do something that prior to 30 years ago was almost entirely a complete figment of our imagination: they all connected together in a near peaceful way. It is still, just a network. Creating other networks, is not hard... and personally, its hardly a new concept to me. I have always operated in that way. Today, I have just replaced some things I used to do with TOR. It&#039;s the nice thing about the concept. I mean, if you really think about it, the web really only is special for that simple fact - the agreement that united the public world. Obviously this comes with it the fact that, for the foreseeable distant future, things like Amazon will fall under the eventual oppression of some government bill. It stinks... but, eventually the internet will be treated the same as if you walked into a store front. It is inevitable. That doesn&#039;t mean you can&#039;t have an open web. The content that is relevant to you, can just as easily move to where it stays just as relevant. Look at file sharing - Warez was a concept easily found on BBS. When that became a bad medium, it moved to IRC. When IRC was supplanted, and it was obvious that people wanted to do more harm than good (or it was obvious some LE caught on), we moved to early P2P filesharing ventures. When those got bad, we went back to IRC, because it&#039;d been forgotten. Then TOR &amp; Bittorrent came through, amongst other things.<br /><br />This is the nature of the brilliant minds that work on these mediums. The dark side of the moon in all forms of society, has existed as long as the light side. A bill in congress won&#039;t change that any more than anything else they try.

				Perversely, the biggest threat to Internet Security is most welcome for SRians, for the following reason:<br /><br />How many people are going to start using technologies like offshore seedboxes, BitTorrent, Bitcoin and the anonymizers I2P and Tor?<br /><br />A lot! <br /><br />Most people will put their hands up because they are easily cowed by technocrats and authoritarians. But the Darknet shall expand enormously as a result of these trends. PGP Club shall be bigger than ever before.<br /><br />And ultimately the holy grail of anonymity systems shall eventually occur. Somebody will figure out a way to combine anonymizers and BitTorrent at the Network level instead of the Application level. Then we win.<br /><br />End Result: More anonymity for us all.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Similarly, Pine loves Internet sales taxes. I hate taxes, but not (so much) those ones. Why? Because the natural result is a huge increase in international shipping services of all kinds, from virtual offices to virtual lockers and more. A whole eco-system develops to avoid taxation, and we will be right at the heart of it. Ultimately within a decade it&#039;ll lead to decentralized postal delivery systems using drones in private hands.<br /><br />So don&#039;t feel down friends! The world is getting worse in terms of freedom, but not for our bank balances!<br /><br />Having said all that, I would prefer to have more freedom for everybody rather than more money, but that choice isn&#039;t being made by me, it&#039;s being made for me by the governments of the world.

Their freedoms are oppressed in ways that extend beyond the internet into their very life freedoms. This is a problem that isn&#039;t easily addressed in the ways that the free world allows. You are right, this IS a danger in those areas. I don&#039;t disagree.<br /><br />But, consider that even in Hitler&#039;s occupation of France, De-Gaulle set up the French underground network that was critical in the eventual&nbsp; invasion that changed the tide of the war. It is not impossible, no matter how dire it gets.<br /><br />Historically speaking, the more advanced the country the faster it moves on from outdated principals. Obviously this isn&#039;t a universally acceptable way of representing the time and course of things, as can easily be applied to the need for extreme reform in many forms of property in the US and most of the world developed or otherwise. Change is a concept that is a function of both the movement of time and the rise and fall of a generation. The US is still dominated primarily by a government of a generation that still used nerd in a negative way, and has little adoption of the true modern system. Until the base of knowledge moves to what things actually are... its difficult to expect that the lawmakers will actually understand and handle law the way that is right. In our eyes, they are doing it wrong... in their eyes, they don&#039;t know what the hell we&#039;re talking about.<br /><br />Countries that suffer the greater oppression are further behind. N Korea struggles to feed its people, to maintain any level of quality of living for anyone other than the government elite. This is the concept that many have tried to inform and educate on communism, the fact that corruption doesn&#039;t allow for the true marxist equality on wealth... and that greed doesn&#039;t allow for the maintenance of overall civil demand. It is what makes it untenable, as true communism is only achievable without the human flaw. Cuba suffered from it, Soviet Russia suffered many, many times with more than one famine for Stalin alone. China changed and adapted its policies, but the suffering still exists. They may not suffer from the mass famine deaths that Stalin&#039;s regime amounted to... but the constant neglect of logical application for industrialization causes just as much health issues, not to mention, corruption still plays the same effect. The government gets rich, and whats supposed to be a communal working for the better of everyone, and sharing to make this work, doesn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />You can&#039;t explain this to countries that haven&#039;t figured it out for themselves. The US may not have chosen communism, but we didn&#039;t get it right the first time either. The government we have today, is nothing like Washington&#039;s government. Hell, when Lincoln entered the presidency, it may have simply been another revolution. It&#039;s never been the same since. France obviously has a hard time getting it right... they&#039;ve had enough revolutions to have made the example by which America achieved it on their own. And the UK&#039;s history, while they may not want it to be this way, isn&#039;t exactly perfect either. India suffers still from the effects that the British had.<br /><br />And, for that matter, the countries you listed have it bad, but there are developed world countries that aren&#039;t much better. Australia keeps moving more and more towards an Orwellian society.<br /><br />These systems don&#039;t work - and the founding fathers of many countries that know these concepts have stated this much. They&#039;ve also admitted that without making the mistake, the options presented look better than others. It&#039;s easy to fall into the beauty of Communism and Socialism. That&#039;s the point of propaganda - it&#039;s easy to like, of course it is. It was written to be that way. It&#039;s hard to really handle though - the fact that it is wrong. How do you go about it? The US chose its path, and was criticized. Now, they tend to shy away from dealing with problems that should be dealt with, regardless of opinion. What&#039;s the right way? Do we shove a nuke up Il&#039;s ass? Do we take out another DRC leader? Do we see how much continuous glass we can make on a desert?<br /><br />These are all terrible options... they all end in death. But what else is there? Kim won&#039;t listen, he thinks he&#039;s the bomb, and he does propaganda pretty well. Look at Vietnam - we tried both ways, we tried to fight and we tried to generate support. We failed on both sides - the north either killed ruthlessly, or defeated the south puppets we chose through simple and easily targeted propaganda too. By the time the war was coming to an end, we couldn&#039;t get an official elected if we fixed the elections.&nbsp; There really just isn&#039;t an easy way to fix the problem.<br /><br />That doesn&#039;t mean that what I said before isn&#039;t applicable though. Those countries ARE oppressed, and the people that work on things like TOR work frequently to help those people get around it. The web is no longer just the web - there are more networks than that, more than we even truly know about. And, to be honest, these policies don&#039;t really read the same as aggressive media control in propaganda lie based countries. The control of copyright information is a topic that needs to be addressed - and if bad bills get it debated, then so be it. It DOES need to be debated. If they do it wrong the first time, that is nothing new. Ignoring intellectual property is only going to make it worse... they&#039;ve done that for long enough. If they&#039;re talking about it now, then it opens the way for dealing with the other systems like patents. It may not go well initially, but as has been said more than once... the nice thing about the US is the endless appeals system. Just because a bad bill is passed, doesn&#039;t mean we stop arguing it.
