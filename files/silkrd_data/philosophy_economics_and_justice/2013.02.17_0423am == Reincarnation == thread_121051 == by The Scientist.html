				Title: <strong>Reincarnation</strong><br />

				This is one of the most interesting and enigmatic categories of the LSD experience. Past-incarnation experiences consist of fragments of scenes, individual events, or entire, very clear and logical sequences occurring at another place and time in history. In this, they resemble elements of the collective and racial unconscious and some ancestral experiences. The events involved, however, are very dramatic and are often accompanied by an unusually intense emotional charge of a distinctly positive or negative quality.<br /><br />In these experiences, you maintain your ego identity; although you experience yourself in another form, another place and time, and another context, you feel that you are basically the same individual entity as in your present existence. You also have a keen sense of being confronted with a MEMORY, of reliving something that you have already seen and experienced. This deja vu and deja vecu flavour is specific; you feel and &quot;know&quot; beyond any doubt that this experience is not related to or derived from anything in your present lifetime, and that it is a manifestation of one of your previous lives.<br /><br />These experiences occasionally happen with relatively high doses of LSD (200ug and up). Belief in reincarnation and familiarity with this concept is not a necessary prerequisite for their occurence. They happen in LSD sessions with scientists who had previously considered the idea to be an absurd superstition. (From Grof, &quot;LSD: Doorway to the Numinous&quot;)<br /><br />Last week I had my first past-incarnation experience. I had previously considered the idea of reincarnation as an absurdity, but I cannot deny what I had experienced. Has anyone else had similar experiences?&nbsp; <br /><br />What do you all think of the idea of reincarnation?

				Theres so many possibilities just not worth experiencing. Reincarnation springs out of the belief that were all one energy force, like decayed organic matter giving rise to new plants, it is not our components that make us, so to say will &quot;I&quot; be reincarnated? No, because i will be no more in the sense of this moment. Will my lifeforce be reused? Perhaps, but what does that have to do with me.

There is only God (universal consciousness), losing himself in creation to the point where he forgets who he is and imagines himself to be a separate creature who is capable of suffering....

It methodically examines 20 cases of spontaneous recall of past lives in young children in India, where reincarnation is accepted, and exhaustively investigates and eliminates the possibility that the children could have known about details of that past life that in some cases were not even known to anyone else. His conclusion was startling for the world of western science so I&#039;ll repost the conclusions he came to from Wikipedia here:<br /><br />The large number of witnesses and the lack of apparent motivation and opportunity, due to the vetting process, make the hypothesis of fraud extremely unlikely.<br />The large amount of information possessed by the child is not generally consistent with the hypothesis that the child obtained that information through investigated contact between the families.<br />Demonstration of similar personality characteristics and skills not learned in the current life and the lack of motivation for the long length of identification with a past life make the hypothesis of the child gaining his recollections and behavior through extra-sensory perception improbable.<br />When there is correlation between congenital deformities or birthmarks possessed by the child and the history of the previous individual, the hypothesis of random occurrence is improbable.<br /><br />The last conclusion is particularly interesting because it implies that there can actually be a physical connection; something that links one to one&#039;s immediate past life by how that personality died, that can manifest in the form of a physical birthmark in the present life.<br /><br />The author, Ian Stevenson, has compellingly rebutted all major criticism of his work that were inevitable to come his way.<br /><br />Sadly, despite his book having been written almost 40 years ago you still see a strong reluctance by western scientists to involve themselves in this field of inquiry. Yes, the area of parapsychology is filled with kooks and cranks, no doubt about it. So much so, the stigma associated with choosing to research and publish anything in this area as a legitimate academic study worthy of pursuit could be a career ending move. I get all that. But at the same time a smart and ambitious academic could do well for him/herself by taking building on or refuting what Stevenson started. More studies need to be commissioned.

It also fucks with people heads in a big way about the fact that this unknown also highlights that an &quot;I&quot; or a &quot;Me&quot; may not actually exist in the way they believe it does. All these things are HIGHLY unnerving to mainly the sub-concious mind of most people, but also the concious mind of more aware individuals. <br /><br />So in order to prevent themselves from losing their shit and spending each and every day in a haywire state of not knowing what existance is, why its here, if for any reason, what happens when you die, what is good and bad, are there consequences, etc etc etc they are either indoctrinated through family/community/culture or seek out a BELIEF that they can relate to and &quot;logically&quot; believe in to put their mind at ease about the fact that NOONE has ANY idea WTF is happening in existence.<br /><br />Yes, I went on a tangent, but its all related. Reincarnation is as Provable as purple unicorns that operate on another level of vibrational reality and are running the show. Now becuase of that, both ARE JUST BELIEFS. Believing in reincarnation is a coping mechanism for people that dont like the POSSIBILITY that they are not an invdiviual, there is no afterlife, and when you die your &quot;self&quot; as you know it is gone forever (not saying I believe that, but its one of the unprovable theories :P). <br /><br />All im trying to say is, (and im not an athiest/science whore, at ALL, I BELIEVE there are spiritual aspects to life, i just accept we ahve no idea about the how, what or why of it) that unless you can prove something through some kinda of experiment or scientfic/measuring process, all beliefs including new age, catholacism, judaism, satanism, athiesm, budhism, hinduism etc etc and everything they claim as fact, are all on the same page. <br /><br />They are all just beliefs as provable and improvable as each other, in order for people to cope with the fact that when it comes to one of the most important aspects of peoples lives, who they are, who they are to the people around them, their feeling of a SELF, noone in existence can give them the answer, it is a complete unknown. Some people then cling to the classic &quot;when you die you go to a place and spend eternity in a utopia with your creator, again, retaining the idea we have of a self. Others, and I find this especially common among people who have expanded their minds past being able to believe in some kinda of utopian afterlife where u spend eternity, grab onto the idea of reincarnation, again, its a way of reassuring yourSELF that its all ok, when you die &quot;YOU&quot;/&quot;I&quot; will still be &quot;alive&quot;<br /><br />To end my rediculous aver analised rant. Reincarnation is a belief, like anything else, jsut as much as believing jesus died for your sins, and it is used to cope witht he fact we have no idea wtf happens to us when we die.<br /><br />Id also like to add, I am not criticising any religeons or spiritual ideas/systems. I believe that becuase religeous/spiritual beliefs help people cope with the unknown result of the physical death of the self image, that If religeon and spirituality are able to add to an individuals life, make them a better person for themselves and those around them, then they should believe in that belief and follow that system. If it works for you, do it, becuase they are ALL just beliefs, dont get caught up thinking that christianity is somehow some form of a lower spiritual belief system. Christianity&#039;s theories are as provable as Scientologies which is as provable as David Ickes theories etc etc etc, you see where im going with this.<br /><br />Anyway<br /><br />S - out.

				I find the topic of reincarnation very interesting although I really don&#039;t know if is a real phenomena or not. Odds are that we have one life and then that is it but is a bit depressing to think this is the case but is the most likely scenario.<br /><br />Religion I feel exists bec it helps people cope with how hard life is and bc people don&#039;t handle well the uncertainty of death.<br /><br />I like LSD but never have personally had any past life experiences while on it but sounds like fun.

Athiesm and Materialism is as you siad, are just as much coping mechanisms/comforting delusions as religeon, spirituality, cherry picking beliefs from different religeons and creating your own philosophies on life. Its a belief that gives people an answer, any answer, to a question there really isnt an answer for. Some people are content with the answer the belief system of Athiesm gives, some need something more comforting like an afterlife in a utopian heaven, some people laugh at organised religeons and their eternal afterlives saying that its a fairytale belief, so they find out about reincarnation and somehow it seems more logical so they cling onto that. <br /><br />At the end of the day, what youve experienced imho is AWESOME. From what I can tell, these LSD experiences have taken you out of a purely comforting belief system in Athiesm, and gave you the ability to analise your existence from an ego-less, unconditioned perspective and start to see that your perspective through the eyes of an athiest Is just that, just another belief like religeon that comforts people. Think of your dispositions/beliefs/perspectives and opinions on existance as a structure, a wall if you will, a wall that encircles the vulnerable part of your mind/self. Now IMHO, when you start altering your state of conciousness, especaiily thought the psychadelic realm of drugs like LSD, Weed, shrooms, DMT, MDMA etc etc etc etc they start to slowly break this wall down, leaving the vulnerable &quot;You&quot; (if this exists) open to perceiving previously blocked out perspectives/opinions in existance. Allowing for you to psychologically &quot;evolve&quot; your awareness of existance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is, that all this talk on spirituality and philosophy, everything ive said, you said, in fact anything any human has ever said on the subject of spirituality and an afterlife, is all just opinion and pure speculation. For that reason, I choose to takwe the position of LOVING talking about philosophy, reading about it, looking into different spiritual paths etc. But always remembering that every one of these opinions on spirituality cannot and probably will never be able to be measured and proven/disproven, so I will never hold a belief system, although, that in itself IS my belief system, lolz.<br /><br />Life is the trippiest fucken trip of all, lol.<br /><br />S

Now IMHO, when you start altering your state of conciousness, especaiily thought the psychadelic realm of drugs like LSD, Weed, shrooms, DMT, MDMA etc etc etc etc they start to slowly break this wall down, leaving the vulnerable &quot;You&quot; (if this exists) open to perceiving previously blocked out perspectives/opinions in existance. Allowing for you to psychologically &quot;evolve&quot; your awareness of existance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is, that all this talk on spirituality and philosophy, everything ive said, you said, in fact anything any human has ever said on the subject of spirituality and an afterlife, is all just opinion and pure speculation. For that reason, I choose to takwe the position of LOVING talking about philosophy, reading about it, looking into different spiritual paths etc. But always remembering that every one of these opinions on spirituality cannot and probably will never be able to be measured and proven/disproven, so I will never hold a belief system, although, that in itself IS my belief system, lolz.<br /><br />Life is the trippiest fucken trip of all, lol.<br /><br />S<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Atheism is definitely not a coping mechanism, there is nothing easy about been an atheist.

Looking at the research evidence, it seems that those who celebrate the Christian meaning of Christmas are on the whole likely to be happier.<br /><br />I being an atheist myself with a religious background and knowing many other people who are atheist can tell you without a doubt that this suggestion a number of you are making saying that atheism is a coping mechanism just like religion is incorrect. <br /><br />I dont like AT ALL the fact that odds are that once you die that is all there is to it but I value truth and freedom above everything and you cant be free if you are living a lie.<br /><br />

				Well if you research history then it is evident that there is an evolution going on here. It&#039;s an energy type of evolution. The physical is just a side effect.

One can become directly aware of God. <br /><br />There are actually many good reasons to believe in the existence of God.<br /><br />1.) Through meditation, mystical illumination, and the use of psychedelic drugs, one can experience God.&nbsp; This experience is orderly, lawful, and publicly verifiable; it is the same across all religions, cultures and eras, and anyone can become a witness to it, if he takes the appropriate steps. Now, orderliness, lawfulness, and public verifiability are the criteria by which we determine sensory phenomena to be real and objective. Since the experience of God satisfies the same criteria by which we judge sensory phenomena to be real and objective, it is rational for someone who has had such an experience to believe in the existence of God.&nbsp; For any argument that you can come up with to &quot;refute&quot; such an experience, I can construct a parallel argument to &quot;refute&quot; the existence of the external world. <br /><br />Therefore, unless you are equally sceptical of the existence of a world outside of your own mind, it is rational for someone who has had a mystical experience to believe in God. <br /><br />2.) Lane&#039;s cosmological argument. Basically: Everything that begins to existence has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe had a cause. Once you unpack what it means to be the cause of the universe, you arrive at the conception of a spaceless, timeless, immaterial, and conscious creator of the universe, which is what most people mean by God.<br /><br />3.) Godel&#039;s ontological proof of the existence of God.<br /><br />4.) According to some interpretations of quantum physics, there has to be a cosmic consciousness or all-seeing mind that pervades the universe determining which state we are in. This interpretation is becoming increasingly held by physicists who are realising the implications of quantum mechanics.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">But I have to say when I look at all the world and I see that everyone suffers and struggles and happy moments are occasional and is mostly neutral times with some good times here and there and a lot of stress and pain in between those good times....I have to say to me that is evidence there is no god but that idea is too painful for the average person to really consider and take in, too much for the average person to handle including myself.........we all fear death and the unknown but I try to be honest with myself and if god exists no religion portrays god correctly as religions are in essence created by humans and our image of God is purely us projecting and totally biased.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>What does human suffering have to do with the existence of God?&nbsp; &nbsp;God has nothing to do with human morality.

The religious dogmatist asserts the existence of a mythic-magical God, while the pedantic atheist points out that there is no &#039;evidence&#039; for such a being, while both sides ignore higher levels of interpretations of God. When you say that God is nothing like what any religion makes him out to be, you no doubt are referring only to a lower-level interpretation of religion. God cannot cannot be described, he is transcendent to thought, and of course so any description of him will be nothing like what he actually is. Religion is just a feeble attempt to describe, with myth and symbol, an experience that cannot be communicated.<br />

				Denial of God is wishful thinking rooted in the fear of not being in control. To know God is to know that you are not in control; that all your thoughts and actions are arising automatically; that everything is pre-decided; in short, that you do not have freedom of the will. You can experience this.<br /><br />Atheism is ultimately rooted in the egotistic fear of annihilation, for to know God is to know that you do not exist.<br /><br />Some people choose not to call it God. Some prefer to call it energy, consciousness, Brahman, Void, Emptiness, etc. It doesn&#039;t matter what we call it; it is real.<br /><br />Why do I believe that I am God? Because I am a scientist. Psychedelic drugs are empirical metaphysics. I can see God just as I see the monitor I am looking at as I type this message; only I see God even more clearly and intensely than I see the monitor. I cannot rationally deny it. Once it is experienced, it has to be accepted, even if you don&#039;t like it.

For instance, the only &quot;evidence&quot; for the truth of Christianity comes after you die, a little late in the game.<br /><br />Science deals with the &quot;how&quot; based on empirical facts. Religion asks the &quot;why&quot; and deals with personal &quot;truths&quot;. A little subjective there, yes. But then again, philosophy also asks the &quot;why&quot;, and its conclusions are arrived at through inductive and deductive reasoning.<br /><br />Overall I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any inherent contradiction between science and deism. And I&#039;m saying this as a strong agnostic grounded in scientific and empirical realism.

For one, &quot;misinterpreting&quot; reincarnation is an odd statement. Not because it can&#039;t be done, but because everyone defines reincarnation differently, nothing has (or even can) go into great levels of depth and detail, so what remains is a large collection of different interpretations of the same basic concept. They do stretch far and wide, but nothing can really be stated as definitively the &quot;right&quot; interpretation.<br /><br />For instance, Zen Buddhism interprets reincarnation as a constant. That is to say, in the last 10 minutes you have been reincarnated an innumerable amount of time. Who you are when you walk in to a room is different than who you are when you leave - and that&#039;s reincarnation. One could theorize for days about what this means in relation to a possible afterlife, but in actuality life after death isn&#039;t addressed as much as it is in Western culture, which I assume has something to do with the &quot;This moment is the only moment in existence&quot; ideology (More Tao than Zen, but you get the picture) - therefore, theorizing about an afterlife takes attention away from what is truly important.

				The things is, all I see is life moving forward, never backward. I&#039;m not talking about just genetic inheritance, but part of the soul/energy of passed ancestors is still inside you, I find that to be a more credible approach to past lives visions, etc. Not just from the human form, but to all that took to get to here, is not like humans just popped out in the air. But I also believe that nature had the intention to create humans from the very beginning, as opposite as the evolution theory which states a serious of random events with no purpose whatsoever.

				It doesn&#039;t matter what you start of believing, the intricacies of the eternal are so overwhelming when you happen upon them it will rewrite anyone&#039;s faith. I like most others was raised to believe what i was told by my parents with blind faith. To be completely truthful my first experience with the collective unconsciousness and first set of past life memories was completely unintentional. A recreational mushroom trip turned into the most significantly life changing moment i never asked for. To begin i had this overwhelming sense that i was dying or on the verge of death, little did i know that to pass through the doors of perception you must experience what some consider death. Obviously I am still inhabiting this consciousness but in that moment i truly left everything i considered myself to be behind. I slipped into the shapeless formless void momentarily before have a feeling i can only liken to &#039;warp drive&#039; i was being whisked along in another form of my existence that was simply light and energy. Before long (If there ever was a before.. or after....) i was aware of the others. They were separate from me but we were in and of each other. I felt a sensation similar to sexual release but not the base depraved sex of the physical world, it was pure Tantric energy. This was the collective all souls reach before reincarnation in my opinion... from here i experienced the same &#039;warp drive&#039; feeling of hurtling through infinity. I experienced what some call ego death, I lost all concept of where i had started this trip of lunacy. There was no end and no beginning, and when you reach the end you start. I definitely was tumbling down the rabbit hole as they say. I suppose i should mention at some point a friend of mine who was with me had undergone a very similar experience simultaneously.&nbsp; I hadn&#039;t freaked out until i became very aware of this current physical form and the other existing at the same time ( time.. HA!) my friend and i seemed to exist in many dimensions i was aware of all at once. Nearly indescribable but i could see our heads conjoined in prisms of light. Our thoughts blurred together and i started picking up words from his mind and vice versa... for a second my puny ego tried to hold onto &#039;reality&#039; and decided what was occurring couldn&#039;t be real so i initiated a test. I said &#039;not the first time&#039; to which he said &#039;nor the last&#039; immediately. We went on like that for sometime. I would think a phrase and he would finish it... not any well known phrase mind you i was making shit up at random it would have been impossible for coincidence. Eventually i gave in to the pulsing overwhelming energy and images, feelings, thoughts, other forms of myself...... i resigned to the collective and let myself float. All concepts of time or self were left far behind and i wouldn&#039;t have minded much if i ever returned. It was as if i had perfect clarity and understanding of the workings of the universe, and my role in it. The dumbfounding colors and shifting paradigms all seemed to make sense and the fabric of reality was me, I nothing else. I also had the sense that I (We) was cosmically waiting. I believe we are waiting for our billion x infinity year dream to come to an end so we may wake up to the ultimate reality of consciousness, at least before we begin our next cycle of creation destruction and rest. But i also realize some of us are not done dreaming yet.....&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; When i completely snapped back to &#039;reality&#039; something had changed in me. I knew i would never be the same but never be able to share my experience because truly words fall short. Having gone to catholic school my whole life I renounced my religion and my &#039;God.&#039; ( You should have seen my parents faces when i told them I am God. HAA!) Still to this day i seek out other members of the extra dimensional club to shoot the shit with and talk about what we&#039;ve seen. For a while i convinced myself i was going insane but I was approached by a clairvoyant who sought me out to tell me I wasn&#039;t losing it. To end all of my doubt he informed me it was &#039;not the first time nor the last&#039; which absolutely blew my fucking mind apart. NO ONE could possibly have known about that experience it was very personal. But then again all of our minds are linked in another dimension so i guess i shouldn&#039;t have doubted... I will say this though; my life was very simple before this experience, now my mind races and i constantly sense... things... Just be careful with the mind altering hallucinogens, once you see the other side you cant forget, cant go back to being blissfully ignorant of the infiite.... At any rate, keep trippin my heady people and keep expanding consciousness. That&#039;s the very summarized version of my story hope it wasn&#039;t too long winded! Never fear the unknown, fear the knowing.

				For those of you who find reincarnation to be far fetched, how about looking at it from a scientific point of view? We know via science that energy is never created or lost. Well, human consciousness is simply electrochemical/electromagnetic. When you pass away the energy that was your basic awareness can&#039;t be lost, it simply shifts into another phase of it&#039;s existence. Also, from birth the only inevitability is that you will eventually meet your death. Everywhere in the universe the pattern of recycling matter and energy is expressed, and nothing is permanent even on a grandiose scale. Even planets and galaxies have a life span in which they meet a &#039;death.&#039; When you leave this world as pure energy it may not be the entirety of what you consider yourself and your current consciousness but it is the seat of your soul, the most basic element in which you can be defined. ( On an unrelated note; those of you who have never had an experience while on hallucinogenics with the collective or past life experiences, next time you&#039;re in peak trip try a deep state of meditation. You may find you can access the higher realms alot easier though the power of LSD or DMT.) You can knock it just dont crack it.&nbsp; 8)

				In the light of past lives and reincarnation, the Buddhist practicing Vipassana would say that we are reborn death after death until we have completely rid ourselves of our &quot;sankaras&quot;, or the negative karma we accumulate during our lives through attachment and aversion. We eliminate our sankaras through meditation that focuses our attention to the body&#039;s sensations, and effectively shedding any judgment over these sensations such as pain or pleasure. Once we accept that all it is, is only sensation, that is just is, we are present in the infinity and stillness of the moment, and we begin to eliminate similar judgments in other aspects of our lives that have caused us to hold on or escape in the past. We do this simultaneously for this life, and for all other lives past. Once all the sankaras have been eliminated and no new ones have been generated (any new attachments or aversions multiply sankaras) our soul is finally free to enter nirvana, for it has rid itself of all its impurities. Otherwise it will keep reincarnating and accumulating more sankaras.

We experience the world subjectively so it APPEARS we are all separate entities when in fact, we are all connected. All possibilities exist simultaneously. In physics, most of us believe this to be true. The double slit experiment, or Young&#039;s Experiment, tells us that matter exists as waves and particles. Once a conscious observer looks at matter the wave function collapses immediately and the particles become something fixed. The problem with proving this theory further is we currently cannot devise an experiment that will allow us to directly observe other Universes where these variations of our own world are played out. All of the evidence we have presently is indirect evidence. The maths actually supports the multiverse and parallel Universe theories.<br /><br />Reincarnation is not as wild an&nbsp; idea as you might imagine. Its been mentioned already in this thread that we all know energy cannot be destroyed and is constantly recycled between energy and matter (E=mc2).<br /><br />So this means it is absolutely plausible for the same mathematics to work within Universal consciousness. Ask anyone in science, and I have asked many, the question &quot;What exactly is consciousness?&quot;. We don&#039;t know. We do know it exists, and that it goes far and beyond the consciousness we possess, but what exactly it is, we may not have a reasonable explanation for many generations to come, or possibly even ever. In fact we will only have an answer to that IF the Universal consciousness decides to share it with us. <br /><br />All the brilliant ideas that have happened since the dawn of modern thinking humans? That wasn&#039;t the idea process of some smart cookie. That was the human mind to which the Universe conveyed its knowledge. When Alexander Graham Bell successfully invented a working telephone, he was up against Elisha Gray. There was much controversy as to which one actually came up with idea first. Of course, it was neither, simply the Universe giving up its secrets. Bell and Gray were simply the receivers of this information. Same goes for Thomas Edison and his numerous competitors to find a metallic alloy that would sustain an electrical current. So next time you have a great idea, don&#039;t pat yourself on the back too hard, thank the Universe.<br /><br />Just as there are a finite number of particles and energy in existence, the Universal consciousness should theoretically also be finite. So when a child is born today, the consciousness within that child will almost certainly have had some physical form previously, whether it be on this planet or another. You could argue when we die, our subjective experiences are released into unified consciousness and some of these experiences can therefore leak into a new conscious being. Truth is, we just do not know other than it is absolutely possible. This is probably one reason why the Universe seeks to create intelligent life, so it can have many billions of subjective experiences and obtain all possible viewpoints. This way the Universe can understand itself better. <br /><br />I believe that we all came from Universal consciousness and to that we shall return. One fine day all life on this planet will cease to exist. Eventually the entire Solar System will cease to exist. Far away another star will burst into life, a planet just ripe for life to evolve will emerge and the whole cycle will begin all over again. Can&#039;t wait&nbsp; :o

				shorter than DrQuantum&#039;s :<br /><br />- reincarnation is a model that interprets the continousity of a universal presence on a timeline<br />- evidence from modern observations and their interpretation in quantum physics gives hints on this universal presence<br /><br />that said, you cannot derive spiritual facts from physical observations, <br /><br />@jundullahi:don&#039;t make the mistake and confuse a word we are discussing here with misconceptions that have been linked to it during the centuries. reincarnation isn&#039;t &quot;yet another reward-and-punishment system&quot; as some authorities liked to tell us to threaten us into obedience. <br /><br />@joywind: i find it&#039;s still a bit hard to let go of the &quot;timeline&quot; and &quot;evolution&quot; thing, i guess i&#039;m not over the fear of death here :O ... in my mind, the timeline model struggles a bit with the &quot;it&#039;s all one&quot; model<br /><br />@Ahoyboy: What is your evidence against reincarnation ? (related question: What is consciousness ?)<br /><br />My opinions -&gt; I think that life starts to make sense only in a bigger picture. The human life span is just too short for this. Conciousness is nothing physical, so where does it go when/after it leaves the body? Reincarnation makes the most sense here, and yes we are not confined to this planet, we probably travel a lot of worlds during our personal evolution, but part of the game is that we are confined to the world we incarnate in WHILE we are there.

				The first few posts in this thread are why masterblaster is the only troll on this forum that I kind of respect. I&#039;ve thought about this for a while.<br /><br />He&#039;s a genuinely intelligent person, which I gathered from some of his posts in the Security forum, and a few posts elsewhere -- those brief moments when he isn&#039;t trolling, or irrefutable logic shows through the trolling. I just can&#039;t fathom why he wastes so much time trolling this forum. What is the point MB?<br />

				I never understood why we lend any but the most abstract credence to the recalled experiences of people who have been &quot;near&quot; death. It&#039;s painfully obvious that this kind of testimony can not be trusted in any remotely scientific sense.

Athiesm and Materialism is as you siad, are just as much coping mechanisms/comforting delusions as religeon, spirituality, cherry picking beliefs from different religeons and creating your own philosophies on life. Its a belief that gives people an answer, any answer, to a question there really isnt an answer for. Some people are content with the answer the belief system of Athiesm gives, some need something more comforting like an afterlife in a utopian heaven, some people laugh at organised religeons and their eternal afterlives saying that its a fairytale belief, so they find out about reincarnation and somehow it seems more logical so they cling onto that. <br /><br />At the end of the day, what youve experienced imho is AWESOME. From what I can tell, these LSD experiences have taken you out of a purely comforting belief system in Athiesm, and gave you the ability to analise your existence from an ego-less, unconditioned perspective and start to see that your perspective through the eyes of an athiest Is just that, just another belief like religeon that comforts people. Think of your dispositions/beliefs/perspectives and opinions on existance as a structure, a wall if you will, a wall that encircles the vulnerable part of your mind/self. Now IMHO, when you start altering your state of conciousness, especaiily thought the psychadelic realm of drugs like LSD, Weed, shrooms, DMT, MDMA etc etc etc etc they start to slowly break this wall down, leaving the vulnerable &quot;You&quot; (if this exists) open to perceiving previously blocked out perspectives/opinions in existance. Allowing for you to psychologically &quot;evolve&quot; your awareness of existance.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is, that all this talk on spirituality and philosophy, everything ive said, you said, in fact anything any human has ever said on the subject of spirituality and an afterlife, is all just opinion and pure speculation. For that reason, I choose to takwe the position of LOVING talking about philosophy, reading about it, looking into different spiritual paths etc. But always remembering that every one of these opinions on spirituality cannot and probably will never be able to be measured and proven/disproven, so I will never hold a belief system, although, that in itself IS my belief system, lolz.<br /><br />Life is the trippiest fucken trip of all, lol.<br /><br />S<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />What a crock of horse-shit. Atheism is simply a lack of belief in a God, so how is it in any way a defense mechanism? That&#039;s all it is, a lack of belief. Your argument reminds me of a time where someone was desperately attempting to convince another that homosexuals choose to be that way, and was met with the following, &quot;They don&#039;t choose to be that way, why would you choose to be bullied and oppressed your entire life?&quot; - This in most cases makes sense. It&#039;s the same situation with holding religious views. Depending on where you live, the views you hold form an overall degree of correlation with what the norm is. Weak minded conformists tend to delude themselves into believing anything that grants conformity, whilst at the opposite end of the spectrum, anti-conformists reject anything that is considered a popular view simply because it is popular and for no other reason. This clearly does not apply to atheism since it is not the most popular of things. This tied in with various other factors including indoctrination and varying social pressures make religion both a defense mechanism for those who are mentally dim and those who would benefit socially from appearing to have such beliefs.

Heaven is eternity. Eternity does not mean an infinite series of events going on forever and ever in linear time. Eternity is outside of time. Your view of &#039;heaven&#039; would be within time -- time going on forever and ever. But heaven is completely outside of time, so it doesn&#039;t &quot;go on forever and ever&quot;. There&#039;s also no boredom, for there is no ego to experience boredom.<br /><br />Heaven can be experienced on earth by practising meditation. It&#039;s a state of timelessness and egolessness. A sense of complete unity with everything. This is the state we go into when we die. There is nothing &#039;terrifying&#039; about it.

				Atheism is not retarded, and to me there is a clear difference between religion and spirituality. I consider myself an atheist, in that I do not believe in a God, monotheistic or otherwise, who has a plan for my life and rules for me to follow. <br />This doesn&#039;t mean that I don&#039;t believe in ANYTHING, or that atheists don&#039;t have their own &#039;spiritual coping mechanisms&#039;. A few pages ago someone said that life was like a fractal...I agree with that. I&#039;ve posted this quote elsewhere but I think it fits here too;<br /><br />&quot;All your nonsenses and truths, your finery and squalid options, combine and coalesce to one noise including laugh and whimper, scream and sigh, forever and forever repeating, in any tongue we care to choose, whatever lessened, separated message we want to hear. It all boils down to nothing, and where we have the means and will to fix our reference within that flux; there we are. If it has any final signal, the universe says simply, but with every possible complication, &quot;Existence&quot;, and it neither pressures us, nor draws us out, except as we allow. Let me be part of that outrageous chaos ... and I am.&quot; <br /><br />One of the main differences between me and a (fervently) religious person is that my beliefs are I suppose less definite, less rigid. They are guided by what I feel and experience rather than what I read or what I am told. And yes, they are shaped somewhat by my experiences with psychedelics. <br />There is an Alan Watts video entitled &#039;The Real You&#039; which I watched after my first high level trip - I agreed with some of it, but not all, and engrained the bits I liked into my personal belief system, which is mine and unlike any other, except by coincidence I suppose.<br />Yeah, you could say I just pick and choose my beliefs but...that&#039;s what I see most religious people doing with their chosen text (mixed fabrics are OK, gays are not, etc) - hey, at least I&#039;m open about it&nbsp; ;)

If you define it as YHWH or Allah or Zeus or Odin or An or any other such god personality, then &quot;God does not exist&quot; is clearly a true position. If you define it as something else, then you&#039;re going to be misunderstood by the overwhelming majority of humans when you attempt to communicate with them about it. If we can know that using a certain word is going to create confusion (we do), we have to stop using that word and find a better way to communicate the concept behind the word.<br /><br />As an atheist, I know that all gods ever posited in human mythology are reflections of human thought. Metaphors. As an agnostic, I know I am not equipped to understand the nature of existence. As a human being inheriting the knowledge so hard won throughout human history, I can observe that attaching ourselves to incoherent belief systems has horrific costs. We absolutely must excise the wisdom and insights of religious traditions from their primitive understanding of how the cosmos works. This kills all religion. Maybe eventually we can reclaim words like &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;God&quot;.

To know God is to give up your ordinary identity. People don&#039;t want to do this. They want to believe that they exist, that they are in control, etc. It&#039;s scary at first when you wake up to the knowledge that you exist only as a thought-image inside the mind of something infinitely greater and more powerful than yourself. This knowledge frightens a lot of people. It&#039;s something we all know deep down, but refuse to admit to ourselves because it is so terrifying. But it&#039;s only scary until we are willing to give up all attachments, and with this comes the knowledge that we are not the thought-image, but&nbsp; the Mind that dreamt it into existence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Here&#039;s where we generally agree, with the exception of your use of the word God. Stop fucking naming it. Talk about it, visualize it, describe it, experience it, but don&#039;t fucking name it. To do so is to lose connection with it. The costs of naming this phenomenon of experienced truth have manifested enough throughout history, and at THIS point in history those costs threaten to end the story of humanity.

Not only did I notice the constant recursion (rebirth), I wrote it down as best I could so I could remember and expound upon it later. I can finally begin to see it more reliably through meditation, and I try not to despair when I&#039;ve &quot;lost&quot; connection with it. I now have the tools to guide myself to plugging back in (or unplugging, however you want to look at it). I&#039;ve never mixed LSD and mushrooms together. I don&#039;t even know what that would do.

				I have experienced many of the things discussed here previously and I really thank you guys for sharing your own spiritual journeys and insights, those have been really helpful. I just wanted to share few things to make this collective journey more effective and pleasant for all of us.<br /><br />People here in forums have different levels of understanding, different points of views, but we&#039;re all similar in that respect that we want to know (experience) the meaning of it all.<br /><br />That&#039;s the reason why we should be respectful of each other, even when you know others don&#039;t know a thing (yet) they must know something and using that something they already know you can support them and let them gently nudge themselves back to THEIR direction if you stand firm (if they have veered off it feels like a support, if they have not then it is considered as an outside pressure and is rightfully fought against) . Simply being aware of that is what makes an average teacher become a great master. Everybody has their own path and tempo, they are all parallel and interlap with each other often but are not the same.<br /><br />I also used to be an atheist and materialist 8). And there is nothing wrong with being one, I think it&#039;s a really important step on your journey, but one shouldn&#039;t forget this not where it ends - your journey has just begun. It&#039;s a kind of psychosocial puberty where you reject everything what has got you there (the good and the bad).<br /><br />It&#039;s mostly a psychological phase, who&#039;s familiar with psychoanalytic thought can see lot of similarities with their concepts of development and how certain feelings are evoked and then dealt with, rejection of gods (parents), however in that phase something really important is created - CRITICAL THINKING. It&#039;s the tool we (in a western culture) need the most.<br /><br />This is why it&#039; is crucial to go through this phase properly, it means going through it by oneself, not to be rushed by outside forces, not to be judged, made fun of, forced to adopt views about how thing &quot;really&quot; are etc (just like with real puberty - care, support, attention).<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve mastered it you can now go on and take next step and start to be critical about your current views.<br /><br />Lot&#039;s of things I didn&#039;t write here today but I know you knew these already :)<br />

			<dd class="postbody">
				When philosopy on religion reincarnation and belief systems are being examined and debated, ConsciousEvolution finds it best to start with facts and then proceed from there to logical conclusions;<br /><br />Fact; when you are a child you are a blank slate, whatever you&#039;re told by your parents is infallable in a childs mind and largely accepted as fact. 99% of the time the child believes what the parents do. If you have parents who believe Hinduism is the ultimate belief, you will believe as well. if you have christian parents you will be a christian.(I speak merely for the child mind, many find their own truth when they are old enough to question such beliefs.)<br /><br />So starting with the fact that we as children are indoctrinated with any beliefs our parents have given us, and reaffirmed with the dogmas of our holy books churches and our individual religious cultures as a whole, we subject ourselves to ignorance and brainwashed ideology. The ego in fact accepts these things readily; how could my parents be wrong? how could all these other believers&nbsp; be wrong? no way! the ego will not accept that as a possibility. so anything that disproves or discredits the belief system is defeated with the almighty concept of having &quot;Faith.&quot; Blind Faith in other mens opinions, dogmatic shells of what can make you a higher being. That being said;<br /><br />No one with these beliefs has sought out any form of understanding, never questioned the definitions of reality, limited perceptions of consciousness, and has only saught out acceptance via the religious community they are brought up in. Now, this groundwork of the child psyche being laid down i can concisely make my point:<br /><br />Religious experience through the ritualistic use of Hallucinogenic substance is the opposite of this. There is no indoctrination. there is no dogma. The information coming from these sacred hallucinogenics is Universal Consciousness, realer than real. So naturally those who have never opened the doors of perception and peered into the formless shapeless cosmos of undefined possibility have no fucking clue what its&#039; even about. This level of true human spirituality is so alien and unknown to 99% of modern humans that the mere description is mind boggling to them.&nbsp; What they cannot grasp is that the human mind exists beyond the body, the body is merely like a TV antenna that picks up and experiences consciousness through the 5 senses, meaning the TV does not make the radio waves but rather translates them into something seeable, touchable, hearable, smellable... Not only do we experience limited consciousness, but the ultimate form of ourselves stretches beyond everything you consider yourself to &#039;be,&#039; or can be defined as. The closest i have ever felt to alive or real was on high doses of LSD Magic Mushrooms Peyote and Mescaline. (Hopefully Ayahuasca by the end of this year...) One is able to see the farce of human existence and the true ultimate reality. Which is we are all one. We are all connected, and we are all just one possible expression of reality.<br />&nbsp;That in fact is the meaning of life. All life. Expression. To express is why we are here, why we were made, why every blade of grass grows withers and dies in its own unique pattern.<br /><br />The universe and therefore our consciousness is more infinite and complex than we can fathom within our 4 dimensional world. But at the same time these experiences with sacred hallucinogenics are individual, and cannot be shown to anyone or explained with mere mortal words for that matter. So when you have experiences with past lives, parallel dimensions, beings from other planes of existence, ultimate existence even, there is no way to bring any shred of that back. No way to combat the dogma of ancient religions with thousands of years of manmade &#039;proof.&#039; When all us modern day LSD Shamans have are our own experiences.<br /><br />So to the ignorant mind (or maybe we should say unexpanded mind) the idea of going against the religion they are born with is downright terrifying, and out of the question! the mind recoils and closes down at the very thought of itself being wrong. Noooo my religion is the only right one, even though there are thousands of religions, each of which has followers that &quot;know for a fact&quot; theres is the right one... that is the ego implant sucking you into Samsara and endless reincarnation....<br />People are scared to shake off the opinions of those who have came before them and seek out what truths lay within themselves. <br />But what opinions you have been taught and believe are your own are truly not. They are the ego wanting to belong. wanting you to stay a talking ape, ever complacent with the regurgitation of others beliefs.<br /><br />I for one see things objectively. there is fact.. and opinion.... no one who peddles opinions on salvation has your best interest in mind because they too are a puppet in the cosmic puppet show...<br /><br />Expand your minds and create your own beliefs. Those of you who dont believe in Reincarnation simply have no experience in the subject. at least youre seeking out answers. <br /><br />My advice would be listen&nbsp; more then you talk. I laugh when i read all these people on here bashing Reincarnation when they have no experience with such matters.... Its like watching a snobbish high school grad disagree with a nuclear physicist about the process of nuclear fission in a matter-of-fact tone... lol<br /><br />For those of you who get angry or discouraged when the ignorant come on these threads and spout their regurgitated beliefs remember one thing;<br /><br />&quot;The empty barrel makes the loudest boom.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Peace Love and Expanded Awareness my Friends&nbsp; 8)<br /><br /><br /><br />On the path to<br />ConsciousEvolution

I remember the first time I did shrooming, some kind of profound understanding of the universe came to me without me having this knowledge before. I was a very different kind of person back then. So I questioned myself if this is just a product of my own thoughts, and I did some research, and found that many many people around the world who has had experienced it also have the same understanding. This convinced me that there is a Universal Consciousness, it is as real as gravity on earth.

				reincarnation trip experience...1000ug LSD<br /><br />War... i appear in one, but I have been here a long time and its all i know. I am a soldier fighting. This is real, I know this can&#039;t be fake although I do question it for a moment. I don&#039;t know who i am, there is no time to figure it out. I am holding an automatic rifle and they are coming. I don&#039;t know who. I am in a wooded-plains area, beside blue pillars that took the place of trees. the grass is green and real looking in the plains in front of me. Guys with straw hats, oh no... many of them, 20, 30, closing in about 200 yards away up the small slope of the plain. i look to my left and right. just many blue pillars on a changing green/purple perfectly flat and plastic looking ground. <br /><br />I have a scope.. and take a look through it at the guys walking fast towards me. its zoom power is strong and i see them clearly. i hold in the trigger and popping sounds float out that gave vibrational disturbances to my visual field. the gun has no kick and i use the scope to knock many down. bullets glowing come towards me about the speed of a car... slowly. i jump behind the pillar. a scratching sound eminates from the blue pillar and it ripples like water on a pond.<br /><br />&quot;DEATH&quot; i scream. its coming, i know it. my last few moments of existence. &quot;DEATH&quot; i scream as i look out from the pillar and see a few guys closing in. i fire from the hip. i look down and see bullets flying through me. my heart gets knocked out of my chest partially. many more holes pierce through and my guts fall out of my chest and back. I cry frantically and lay down in the brown and pink goo. When is it all going black, I wonder. two men appoach me. They are asian with glowing eyes. These men are the givers of my eternal blackness, and I hate them but am more afraid. One mumbles some kind of goodbye and bullets are fired into my head. It jiggles me around and the scene fades to black. I am not sure, but i think after this &quot;nightmare&quot; i was unconscious for some time... or i don&#039;t remember it.<br /><br />
