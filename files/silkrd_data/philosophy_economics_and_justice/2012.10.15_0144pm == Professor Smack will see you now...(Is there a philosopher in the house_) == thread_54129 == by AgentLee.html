				Hello everybody. When I am not shooting heroin into my arm (and sometimes when I am) I teach moral philosophy. If anyone would like to hear what a jaded, over-educated dope fiend with a penchant for tweed has to say on the matter of justice and ethics I&#039;d be happy to blether on until I go blue.<br /><br />My areas are specifically the modern idea of justice with reference to Rawls and Sen, bioethics and the usual stuff on moral and political philosophy, in addition to a lot of critical theory.<br /><br />Questions (about the subject, not my degenerate private life and addiction to moral turpitude), interest in reading lists, and perhaps even requests for study ideas or assignments are welcome. <br /><br />

What do you feel might be some interesting areas of overlap? Because I&#039;m always up for a good bullshit session. I haven&#039;t done much study in either morality or ethics, but off the top of my head I&#039;d guess there might be some interesting territory to explore in the overlap between the concept of justice and epistemology.

He lays out the four options, and IMO builds a pretty damn convincing argument for the last. First, &quot;only personal consideration/no collective consideration,&quot; second &quot;only collective consideration/no personal consideration,&quot; third &quot;both considered but collective consideration held over personal consideration,&quot; and last &quot;both considered but personal consideration held over collective consideration.&quot; Sounds like a centrist Republican political position when I write it out like that, lol but Nagel does a pretty damn convincing job of describing why linking the two in that configuration is necessary and beneficial.

Appreciate your replay dude! <br /><br />Thats kinda how i&#039;d played it out. Sometimes i find myself asking people &#039;why&#039; they care... especially about environmental issues. I care for the environment - but its tricky to find a hedonistic moral reason why an underwater ecosystem should matter and therefore not be destroyed for someone else who DOES have an hedonistic moral interest.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Ya man, def, and that&#039;s a REALLY good question. I ask myself the same question probably every time I see somebody expressing a perspective with a certain degree of certitude. &quot;How have they come to be some convinced in what they&#039;re saying?&quot; Of course, unless the hypothetical environmental crusader is an avowed moral hedonist, he probably doesn&#039;t have a hedonistic moral reason for believing the truth of what he&#039;s saying. He probably reached his conclusions via a different track. Personally speaking, I used to be totally dumbfounded that there were still literalist Christians in this country. The I opened my eyes and realized I was the one in the fucking minority! Now I just accept that there are a lot of different ways of thinking out there, and content myself to try to speculate on how that person&#039;s system of knowledge might have to be ordered for him to choose that perspective. Like with the environmental crusader, on the wackier end he&#039;ll be &quot;all collect/no pers,&quot; though more often than not they&#039;re just &quot;both but collect over pers.&quot; Now, in my way of thinking, these aren&#039;t changeable positions, like your wardrobe. To some degree they&#039;re hardwired due to a person&#039;s nature and nurture (though not to the extent that they make a person&#039;s life deterministic). Now, if that is the case, then I&#039;d say that environmentalism is as good an &#039;-ism&#039; as a person could choose to fit in that &quot;collective&quot; box (and remember, they need some thing there because of the way they&#039;re wired) as anything I can think of. Seems more noble an enlightened than just rabid veganism (for example). I mean, we are letting the environment get trashed to the point that it&#039;s not longer able to support human life to the degree it was even 20-30 years ago (or better put, we&#039;re letting a relatively small number of people get filthy rich in the process of doing the trashing, while the vast majority of people receive little benefit).<br /><br />Anyways, this is mainly what goes though my mind, but you&#039;re doing some actual asking? I bet their general response is something along the lines of, &quot;How could you NOT care??&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;:o

				Merely here again to restate the point of my presence. I&#039;ll happily go into issues relating to politics, justice and ethics if anyone cares about the relevant positions on these fields nowadays.<br /><br />
