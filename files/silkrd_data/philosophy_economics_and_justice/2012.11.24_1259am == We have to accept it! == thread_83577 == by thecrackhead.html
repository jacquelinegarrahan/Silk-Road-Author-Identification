				<br />Btw.. <br /><br />I prefer to embrace Godding instead of accepting it like it&#039;s a chore. <br /><br />It&#039;s why we get here/now to play with :)<br /><br />It&#039;s fucking awesome, for those who choose to see. <br /><br />Isn&#039;t it a bit nuts the level of current awareness? The lack of too haha. But this is the place for life/spiritual revolution my dear goddess. <br /><br />Come&nbsp; on nays... you can have a deep and profound spiritual transformation that affirms your existence, your significance and brightens your moments each day. You are a powerful creator no doubt. god INformation that is.

				Here&#039;s the deal my friends. <br /><br />Ego is what we use to differentiate ourselves to all other points of existence. How we define ourselves. Except we are also constant change. Growth. Whether it seems like it or not. Ego is only interested in &quot;time&quot;. What happened, what will happen.. The mind and the ego looove to carry on, be the boss, tell stories, concoct any random sort of thinking process that it sees fit. Most people spend much of all their thinking into thinking about the past or worrying about the future. <br /><br />This moment, being purely present... purely aware. There&#039;s no &quot;thought&quot; happening at that point. <br /><br />Time does not exist. Linear time especially. It&#039;s part of the illusion that is the game. The time is now. You have always been, are, and always will be... and in this moment of NOW. <br /><br />And in terms of &quot;meds&quot; .......acid, shrooms, MDA/MDMA, Ketamine, DMT have all shown new points for perspective on truth and existence. <br /><br />Drugs are, generally speaking, why we&#039;re on this forum. <br /><br />

				god is real. religion is the lie. <br /><br />christopher lagan can prove the existence of your soul, the afterlife, and even god,with mathematics. too bad we are all too stupid to understand it. as in there are literally only five or six people on the planet with the intelligence to fully understand the equations.

				The illuminati was originally developed to be a meeting place between both religious minds and scientific alike.<br />There is no reason why both cannot compare ideas, beliefs etc.<br />It is just unfortunate that in this modern age, all the catholic church care about, is money, gold thrones to sit on, leadership and basically couldnt give a shit about the lesser man.<br />Now, it seems, science is willing, but religion is a no no.
