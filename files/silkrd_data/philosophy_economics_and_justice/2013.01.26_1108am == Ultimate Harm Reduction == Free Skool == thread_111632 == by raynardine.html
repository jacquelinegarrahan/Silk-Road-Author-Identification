				In my opinion this community basically does this, but around the time global anarchy was achieved it seemed certain agendas started be being placed on it&#039;s members.<br />The latest being this weird scenario with overblown censorship from the mods being the topic yet censorship was abundant in the op&#039;s thread and when reading thru OP&#039;s early post he seems quite intelligent but suddenly because quite disruptive and used misinformation and topical spam to have the mods silenced and in the act censored. The whole thing seems devious and a use of misdirection and twisting the truth to seek revenge. Wouldnt most normal people simply contact an admin and have it dealt with rather start a thread full of spam that was repeatedly used til effective. Seemed very much counter productive in the least. Obviously one form of censorship is not viewed like another.

All objects such as forums and chatrooms within a pure 100% peer-to-peer network are abstracted from the underlying servers, if any, with multiple layers of cryptography and decentralization.<br /><br />I think that for something like a pure anarchic free skool to work in reality, and really succeed, we need to cease relying on centralized servers for anything whatsoever.<br /><br />Although I&#039;m willing to host servers in the interim, the longer term vision is to collectively write programs and software that would make servers irrelevant and obsolete.<br /><br />Silk Road would still exist, but not in the form it takes today.<br /><br />Tor and Bitcoin would be unrecognizable in 20 years. Bitcoins will probably cost 500-1000 USD each in 20 years.<br /><br />Technology marches on, but someone has to engineer it.
