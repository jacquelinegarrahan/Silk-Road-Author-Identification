				I have a theory that nbombs remain legal because if they ban them, they advertise the glorious NBOMe class of substances. Quite a pickle for them, isn&#039;t it? With the stocks I&#039;m bringing in, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll care that the Government puts the price up. It&#039;s hard selling something people know nothing about, something which hasn&#039;t been said to be bad by our enemies.

				I think they are illegal a lot of places. Probably fall under the analogue act in the US or something like it elsewhere. <br /><br />Even if they aren&#039;t, its because a gov&#039;t is moving slowly. Not some sort of conspiracy.

				Wasn&#039;t suggesting a conspiracy, but it doesn&#039;t even in tests mandated by the Govt here in Australia for urine drug screening. If they change anything in the law, we all here about it, and it works like advertising. It&#039;s just a problem all politicians face, and I find it interesting. It&#039;s quite a pickle always being a mooching asshole unwilling to face reality. It&#039;s just like a liars crux.

				Governments just haven&#039;t caught on to them yet, but it&#039;s taken the attention of a few countries/states (Russia, UK, etc., what Wikipedia and Erowid say). The US government would mostly likely regard the NBOMe series as analogues of the 2C series under the Analogue Act, but a provision in the act makes the chemicals in question legal as long as they&#039;re not for human consumption, and the government is possibly okay with leaving it in this gray zone for now. It&#039;s not big enough to be a priority.

				Nbombe Is now a class B substance in the UK. They made no major headlines about it, just a small column in a newspaper on page 8 or something, No big deal, so as to not attract any attention.However apparently it is only a temporary ban for a Year until &quot;more research&quot; is done.

				The NBOMs have been attracting a lot of bad publicity in Australia relating to teenagers taking them and doing stupid things like jumping off balconies and dying. The press calls them synthetic LSD and connects them to drug on the net penomena. In fact I&#039;m pretty sure one State passed emergency legislation to ban them. Though I&#039;d have thought they were illegal anyway as 2C analogues.<br />I personally don&#039;t mind them when partying with a few drinks but can understand people into the real psychelics not enjoying them.

				I think we need to stop thinking about rc&#039;s as replacements for other drugs.&nbsp; Think of them as what they are unique drugs with thier own novel effects.&nbsp; &nbsp;The nbome series of chemical to me seems to be a far more recreational experience when used safely.&nbsp; The biggest problem I&#039;ve seen is you get people who think they can take as much as they want.&nbsp; Their always the one who it seems have a problem.&nbsp; The nbome series is super selective at a very few number of receptors, and it seems will overstimulate those receptors quickly with heavy use.&nbsp; People need to take that into consideration, with L it is so promiscuous your not really focusing on any one receptor and any strain is spread out.&nbsp; Every one knows that you are supposed to use lsd sparingly to give your brain a time to recover.&nbsp; Well just think how much more time is needed when its just a few receptors that did all that craziness.&nbsp; The problem I see with most of the new psychedelic rc&#039;s is that they were invented to do mapping studies of very specific neurons.&nbsp; We need some promiscuous molecules made for recreation.&nbsp;

				&nbsp; &nbsp; The obvious answer to this problem, is to decrease the price of, or legalize, LSD.&nbsp; Perhaps we will see more of these new, novel, lysergamides? most of the people I know who tried AL-LAD or LSZ liked it almost as much, eventually there will be so many drugs out there, 2000 per year by 2020(according to shulgin himself) that we really will have &quot;a drug for everyone&quot;, if NBOMe&#039;s aren&#039;t your bag, find something that is, and do baby doses.&nbsp; I keep hearing about vaporization as a route of admin with NBOMe, it sounds like a good idea so people don&#039;t get it confused with acid- because LSD won&#039;t vape and NBOMe will.&nbsp; Still, there could be residue, 3mg of residue from multiple uses would appear small, yet could cook someone.&nbsp; Eh, I think they&#039;ll just ban them as they come along, eventually the bans won&#039;t make any sense, there will be too many compounds, and the newer drugs will replace the old.&nbsp; The main difference now, is that there are 100x as many chemists and a flourishing culture of psychedelics going back 120+ years in western culture, if you consider mescaline, and other cultures back to the beginning of time.&nbsp; They found a mushroom man sculpture in the Sahara going back pre-10000BC, and there are 40,000yo etchings of Echinopsis Peruvianus in the Atacalma desert in Peru.&nbsp; The genie is out of the bottle, Alice fell down the rabbit hole, and there is no going back! no one gets out of here alive!

				Almost every terrible trip report I&#039;ve read were where the person took 30mg or somewhere around that.<br />The very few that weren&#039;t really high doses, the psychoactive wasn&#039;t to blame.

Imipramine has reportedly been a first-line defense for underground treatment of LSD overdose.&nbsp; Lesson: if you are going to thumbprint or puddle yourself, work up a tolerance.&nbsp; The expense of LSD at current market prices keeps most of these accidents from happening, IMO.&nbsp; I&#039;ve bought tabs for less than $40/30, that is just too much temptation for some people, at such a low price point, it is almost enabling.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bad thing now, like the aussie commenter mentioned, is adverse NBOMe events leading people to believe that LSD is the drug in question, because it comes on blotter.&nbsp; Isn&#039;t the media great? <br />&nbsp;Now that it&#039;s $7-$20 a hit, isn&#039;t it about time that LSD pills/gels make a comeback?

(well written trip reports, knowing the exact dose, not mixing drugs etc)<br /><br />Me and 3 friends took it the other week and I thought it was amazing. Better than LSD (which I have taken 50+ times). It was just a very strong visual high with a clear head. I&#039;m finding it surprising so there are people having negative side-effects? Are they just inexperienced? Are they sure they&#039;re taking the dosage they think they are? Mixing it with other drugs? I took 1mg and I&#039;ll probably take 2mg next time<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Personally, I have been around the road long enough now to have seen the &quot;rise and fall of nbome&quot;. While it still sells fairly well, What I mean by the rise and fall of it is that for a short period of time I think some people actually thought it may well be a substitute for LSD, which it simply is not. Nothing is ever as good as the original in my opinion. <br /><br />I have tried Nbome 3 times, Once it was 25i Nbome, I had 3 1200ug tabs, Stupid I know, But I did, Anyway, It was a good trip but it had a &quot;dodgy feeling&quot; to it, A Chemical feeling that LSD just does not have. <br />The second time I tried 25cNbome and it was just nowhere near as good as LSD, and not as good as the 25i.&nbsp; It just was not up to much, It felt as if it was trying to &quot;fake&quot; the hallucinations. Nothing was as clear, There certainly was not any sort of spiritual awareness to it and it just seemed cheap really. <br />The last time I tried mixing 25c and 25i and I did not enjoy it at all, It felt like a poison in my body and I decided I was never taking Nbome again. <br /><br />I can see young teenagers up to about 16 years old enjoying it, possibly buying it in larger amounts because of the price however in my opinion, It does not match up to LSD in any way shape or form, or any other hallucinogen, such as cacti, magic mushrooms or mescalin. <br /><br />As for what your asking about anecdotal evidence, There is none. Or very little if there is, Nbome is a fairly new substance, Around 10 years old I think and only really came to light majorly a few years back. <br />people get their evidence from in depth reading of trip reports, And through threads like this. If there is any community in the world that can diagnose bad substances, It is the SR community. <br />I saw the thread with you discussing this topic with SynthesisWizard as well , I have to say im siding with him on this one. <br /><br />Be carefull with nbome, it may seem good because it is cheap, But would it be worth it if it did long lasting damage to your body, or your friends? <br />There may not be scientific evidence to prove this yet, But Is there scientific evidence to prove otherwise?<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve been in the scene for 8 years - other chemicals that ARE dangerous we found out about very quickly. For example, mephedrone. NBOMe was popularised in 2010 - if it was as dangerous as you&#039;re saying then itd be a lot more well known.&nbsp; I think the issue comes from people like you 3.6mg for your first dose for a new chemical. are you insane? It&#039;s not LSD (I thought it was better - less headfuck. Nicer visuals). Don&#039;t treat it as such<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>As I said it was stupid, I did state that clearly, But that is not why I didnt like it, It was to do with the times I tried it afterwards that made me not like it. It is not a smart thing to do, it was retarded and I admit it, But boy it was a trip.<br />No, I disagree about it would be more known and about it having more visuals and less of a headfuck than LSD. It is completely the opposite with me, More of a headfuck and less visuals, More to do with peripherals etc. And most of the bad reports do not come in from people taking larger amounts, They come from people who are expericned with other psychadelic compounds and find Nbome to be much worse.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&#039;opposite with you&#039; - exactly! Everyone is different. Some people really don&#039;t like LSD but to go around saying it&#039;s &#039;dangerous&#039; and should be avoided with no-proof is irresponsible. It&#039;s just as likely LSD-25 could not agree with someone and give them a bad trip. <br /><br />Now if there&#039;s any real evidence of experienced trippers having bad effects (ie; mephedrone. When mephedrone first came out in 2008(?) my old business partner went on a 2 day binge and couldn&#039;t walk for 3 weeks. When my friends take it for more than a day or two I can see the vasco-constriction (blue fingertips). But everything I&#039;ve heard so far is people taking insane amount 3-30mg and then saying it&#039;s dangerous. If there is any evidence (I know there won&#039;t be scientific studies - but maybe someone from the Advanced Drug Discussion forum on bluelight could shed a light (ie: is fastandbulbous still around?) <br /><br />

				AuraithX it&#039;s just as you say, people taking insane doses! I personally took mephedrone daily for more than a year with no ill effects, but rarely binged more than 12 hrs at a time and all was good. For me it was the drug of my choice! But each to their own.<br />Took 2CI every weekend for a year or so with no major issues except for feeling a bit wrecked the next day on the odd occassion.<br />As for 25i, have taken it quite regularly on weekends, sometimes 2 x 1200ug in one night. Only ill effect is a cracker of a headache the next day if I don&#039;t eat any food at all.

Think of them as what they are unique drugs with thier own novel effects.&nbsp; &nbsp;The nbome series of chemical to me seems to be a far more recreational experience when used safely. The biggest problem I&#039;ve seen is you get people who think they can take as much as they want.&nbsp; Their always the one who it seems have a problem. The nbome series is super selective at a very few number of receptors, and it seems will overstimulate those receptors quickly with heavy use.&nbsp; People need to take that into consideration, with L it is so promiscuous your not really focusing on any one receptor and any strain is spread out.&nbsp; Every one knows that you are supposed to use lsd sparingly to give your brain a time to recover. Well just think how much more time is needed when its just a few receptors that did all that craziness.&nbsp; The problem I see with most of the new psychedelic rc&#039;s is that they were invented to do mapping studies of very specific neurons.&nbsp; We need some promiscuous molecules made for recreation. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was not going to quote the whole post, but more people need to read this. <br />There is a potential for overdose that is present with 25i, but the required dosage to actually put your life in danger is very much high up there, probably around 8 times a mid-heavy dose. While I do have the utmost respect for Tyl3r and his work, and understand his decision to leave the scene and the reasons behind it, I also feel compelled to fill the role of the devil&#039;s advocate here.<br /><br />I feel like a lot of the negative things I read on NBOMe have more to do with its direct impact on the LSD market, and less on how actually threatening to human health the drug itself is. I myself don&#039;t think it has a high potential for abuse, and overdosing is never something I have been worried about taking the drug, as I would not stuff 8 tabs in my mouth or take a few NBOMe hits while drinking a lot of alcohol (which has obviously proved a very dangerous mix in the past.) <br />As for its effect on the LSD market, that is the real crime right here, and in my opinion a good example of one of capitalism&#039;s big flaws. 25i is significantly cheaper and easier to produce than LSD, and while it can be argued that it did steal most of its market share from already-established psychedelics it still reaches out to some groups of people that would not necessarily enjoy the LSD experience, as well as drive away others due to its relative shallowness compared to LSD. It definitely has its own defining characteristics, and is in no way &quot;low-tier LSD&quot; in itself, although I do understand why some people would feel that way, and the thought process behind it. Its euphoric effects, flashy visuals and relatively inexpensive costs drove a lot of dealers to turn to NBOMes for their street acid deals and whatnot, and seems to have left a lot of people disappointed in the process (or a few people and many bandwagoners). I would always rather purchase LSD directly off of Silk Road anyway, as street acid can pretty much be nearly anything these days...<br /><br />As for the actual health concern, we are very aware 25i has been linked to hospitalizations and even deaths in the past, but do believe unreasonable or clearly inappropriate use of the drug was involved in nearly every case. We have dozens of new and returning customers every week, and do exchange quite a lot of messages with them every day, and I have to say that in the entire year we have been doing business here so far we have been reported ONE SINGLE case of hospitalization linked to our products, from a guy that apparently witnessed his friend &quot;get real drunk and take 5 hits&quot;. Even if many of the local-level dealers we do business with don&#039;t necessarily check in regarding things like that, it is still is a very low percentage considering the amount of tabs we move, which is not at all what you would think reading this thread.<br /><br />I just feel like if NBOMes really were a new epidemic to stop at all costs, as well as Earth&#039;s demise, we would have heard about it by now.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shag

The reasons that made it dangerous came out very quickly. Why hasn&#039;t this happened for NBOMe?

				I&#039;m jumping into this thread late but I&#039;ll give my opinion as someone who&#039;s tried nbomes and has something to compare it to.<br /><br />Fact is deep down I do think it&#039;s more dangerous than acid but that has everything to do with dosage. The difference is that you can go way overboard with LSD and still not risk a medical emergency and that&#039;s obviously not the case with the n-bombs which is made worse by the fact that they&#039;re cheap. Even worse than that they&#039;re often sold as powder which only invites disaster. How the hell does the average joe measure 1mg of powder?<br /><br />However as long as you&#039;re responsible enough to hold yourself at the 2 or maybe even 3 blotter tab mark and not do it all the time I would agree that this chem is reasonably safe, fun and an acceptable alternative to LSD. I know that&#039;s a lot of ifs but I&#039;m pretty sure most can handle it. And LSD isn&#039;t &quot;magical&quot; or &quot;divine&quot;. It&#039;s a semi-synthetic chemical that acts on neuroreceptors. Just like the 2c family does.

				<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I did some research recently into psychedelics and SSRIs after a friend of mine had a bad reaction to one of the newer ergoloids on 40mg citalopram(the highest dosage allowed by law) which he has been fed some bullshit science about being only active if the non-enteric pills are not crushed.&nbsp; SSRIs and NBOMe act primarily upon 5HT2 receptors, so much so, that the 5HT1 receptor complex becomes &quot;desensitized&quot; now, you might think this is a good thing, 5HT1 is associated with nausea and migraines, right? desensitization isn&#039;t bad, right?&nbsp; its just tolerance, right? <br />WRONG.<br />Desensitization, I believe, is a side effect of BOTH of these drugs, leading to adverse reactions of an unpredictable type.&nbsp; &nbsp;Desensitization, leads to a downregulation, lets visualize this as a balanced lever, the more desensitization, the larger the fulcrum becomes, the less force is necessary to push the lever down.<br />&nbsp; Eventually, the lever becomes so unstable that the result becomes completely unpredictable.&nbsp; This is why it is dangerous to sell any psychedelic, that is why most of us are here, we don&#039;t want some 20yo kid telling us we sold him &quot;bad acid&quot; and getting robbed/beatdown by his friends, because his zoloft didn&#039;t agree with the acid he was taking.&nbsp; The younger generation these days see themselves as the &#039;hero&#039; generation, and that every problem can be overcome.&nbsp; We have lived too long to know this is not the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#039;t care if people do NBOMe, I just am continually surprised that NO ONE I&#039;ve talked to even knows what it is, outside of SR.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could be wrong about some of the ideas in this post, I&#039;m not saying SSRIs are the problem, I&#039;m saying that they could be the key to understanding why NBOMe has the dangers that it does.

It&#039;s a frikkin chemical that has a certain reaction in your body which YOU interpret as supernatural. A lot of people, me included, could go on an acid trip and report a life-changing experience. It happens with DMT or falling in love or eating a bad burrito and it can certainly happen with nbomes too.

				Didn&#039;t tyler (I think) put 25i/b on his tabs to stop people selling them as LSD? I think this is a good idea because:<br /><br />People are dicks and sell it off as LSD because it&#039;s easier<br />Kid wants to try LSD does no research but his friend has told him you cant die from it<br />Kid ups his dose and decides to be cool and do a thumbprint type dose<br />Death<br /><br />Far-fetched I know. I have no problem with nbomes (don&#039;t particularly like them though, find them lacking) but it pisses me off when people don&#039;t inform the users of what they are putting into their bodies (or outright lying). This is when it becomes dangerous. At the end of the day we know 90% of drug users do not do any research and go by word of mouth and these drugs don&#039;t have a safe history so if you sell them you should do your best to make sure that whoever receives them doesn&#039;t try and pass it off as LSD. I know this shouldn&#039;t be the vendors responsibility but in reality if the vendor doesn&#039;t make it his then the street dealer definitely isn&#039;t.<br /><br />BTW - Tyler you where a fantastic vendor and your decision is totally understandable. You where making a killing and decided that you couldn&#039;t continue because you knew the inevitable...<br /><br />These drugs are still going to hit the market so if the government isn&#039;t going to regulate them maybe the vendors should lead by example but by the same token I wonder how much of any 25x&#039;s sales would drop if they where labeled?

				I love LSD as much as the next guy but the &#039;no body load&#039; idea if the acid is &#039;clean&#039; is a myth.&nbsp; Psychedelics effect everyone in different ways and personally LSD gives me a mild body load but I had a friend that couldn&#039;t trip without getting terrible cramps.<br /><br />25c gave me severe vasoconstriction up until recently.&nbsp; I don&#039;t know what changed, maybe my diet, maybe the fact that I&#039;ve been exercising more, maybe that I quit smoking.&nbsp; But the last time I took it it was one of the cleanest feeling trips I&#039;ve ever had.<br /><br />Point being, everyone&#039;s mileage is going to vary as far as body load goes.<br /><br />As to LSD giving deeper insight, I guess this really depends on what you&#039;re after.&nbsp; Mushrooms and DMT both have their own insight to offer as they bind to different receptors in your brain then LSD does.&nbsp; There&#039;s really no best psychedelic just like there&#039;s no best kind of food or best kind of wine.&nbsp; There&#039;s just different tastes for different folks.

				Yeah, wavelength, I do have to agree with you that my experience with 4-ACo-DMT, bought here on SR from the guy who sells it in pill form, needs to be repeated because it came just two weeks after getting blitzed on 2mg of 25i-Nbome. For me the body load on the nbomes is moderate at that dosage (and I&#039;m in my mid forties and out of shape which should be saying something) but the thing that I don&#039;t like is that cross tolerance to anything stronger than a milkshake. Two weeks should have been enough to reset my tolerance but I&#039;m guessing not.<br /><br />Still have 7 tabs of Al-LADooh akbar left :-)

				I&#039;d like to provide a counter opinion to all the NBOMe hate.<br /><br />While yes, they have much more of a body load than LSD, and are progressively less safe in larger doses, telling people to avoid NBOMe&#039;s at all costs seems a bit close-minded, especially for a place like these forums.<br /><br />They can be a fantastic experience (even spiritual or deep or profound too). If someone is interested in them, they should do the proper research and decide if it&#039;s right for them, as a responsible drug user would with any drug. And maybe start out with very small doses and work up from there, just to be safe.<br /><br /><br />@shizzlefitz<br /><br />Try some mushrooms; you are indeed missing out on something. :)

There are people all over this thread telling you the negative effects of Nbome and you are refusing to take their answers seriously, I have no idea why. If your looking for direct scientific evidence then it will be harder to find, But the fact you are not taking anyone seriously in this thread is annoying. <br />As i said previously I have seen the thread between you and an lsd vendor where he was telling you about tyl3r&#039;s comments, and provied links, And told you that tyl3r had easily sold over 10,000 tabs and you were dismissing it and saying that 10,000 is a very small amount and that you personally had sold hundreds of thousands. <br /><br />I will add this was in a thread started by you, Where you were asking if a vendor sending you Nbome in a letter with the tabs in the open wrapped in a couple of bits of notepad paper was safe stealth. <br />As SW said, If you were selling hundreds of thousand of tabs, Even hundreds you would know this was not acceptable. <br /><br />Just take what people are telling you and accept it, You get what you pay for and thats that. <br />LSD is clearly better/safer than nbome. <br /><br />Hff

There are people all over this thread telling you the negative effects of Nbome and you are refusing to take their answers seriously, I have no idea why. If your looking for direct scientific evidence then it will be harder to find, But the fact you are not taking anyone seriously in this thread is annoying. <br />As i said previously I have seen the thread between you and an lsd vendor where he was telling you about tyl3r&#039;s comments, and provied links, And told you that tyl3r had easily sold over 10,000 tabs and you were dismissing it and saying that 10,000 is a very small amount and that you personally had sold hundreds of thousands. <br /><br />I will add this was in a thread started by you, Where you were asking if a vendor sending you Nbome in a letter with the tabs in the open wrapped in a couple of bits of notepad paper was safe stealth. <br />As SW said, If you were selling hundreds of thousand of tabs, Even hundreds you would know this was not acceptable. <br /><br />Just take what people are telling you and accept it, You get what you pay for and thats that. <br />LSD is clearly better/safer than nbome. <br /><br />Hff<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Actually NBOMe is a much more stable chemical than LSD so it&#039;s fine to transport this way. My cousin jumped in the pool with his and they still worked fine.<br /><br />Further more, there are a handful of people claiming negative physical effects. The only one i was taking seriously was Vanquish&#039;s but he&#039;s in detox not and in not so sure NBOMEe was the problem in his life. <br /><br />I&#039;m asking people to go and post well written reports with dosage, interactions, drug history, etc. SPREADING HARM REDUCTION instead of the nonsense in this thread. Go read the thread in off topic I&#039;ve posted in if you don&#039;t believe I&#039;ve been doing this for the best part of a decade.

				I recently did about 600ug of 25i and had a great time. Enhanced all my day&#039;s activities especially taking a walk outdoors. I highly recommend that if you&#039;re interested in nbome to try atleast a small sample and work your way up.

Your trip.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Amen brother, that&#039;s exactly what I would have said myself - keep this dirty nasty shit far away from your bodies.<br />I still haven&#039;t been &quot;right&quot; ever since my 25I-NBOMe episode.&nbsp; It definitely really fucks with your serotonin receptors.<br />There has to be some weird very concerning chemical changes in regard to what happened to me neurological pathways/<br />I can still trip, but my tolerance is strange at the moment.&nbsp; I&#039;m wondering if somehow it leads to long term damage to the receptors similar to MDMA if you don&#039;t post/preload.<br />The tension headaches, seizures, thought loops, and audio distortions - are not my sense of an ideal trip. <br /><br />I do believe that my receptors have returned to some sense of normalcy since then.&nbsp; <br />But I really fucked up and should have instantly reached for melatonin and 5-HTP after this happened.<br />Seriously these things hit your serotonin receptors in the worst possible way.<br />It&#039;s alarming, for sure.&nbsp; I honestly think age has the biggest factor here.&nbsp; At least when you are young you can still heal quickly and usually make full and healthy recovery.&nbsp; <br />When I was younger I could no doubt push my body to extreme heroic dosages of substances and come out perfectly fine.<br /><br />Now that I&#039;m older and my brain chemistry has changed, because of the constant abuse to all of my receptors due to recklessness and the all to well &quot;I&#039;m invincible syndrome&quot;.<br />MDA benders, lack of knowledge in general and the fact that lots of the information out there now wasn&#039;t available then.<br /><br />I&#039;m not entirely sure what it does to your brain exactly, but from the way it fries your head like an egg.&nbsp; <br />I highly doubt anything good could possibly come of it.<br />On the flip side...<br />LSD is meant to cleanse the mind, body, and soul.<br />Repair your neural pathways, and stimulate your brain into it&#039;s own mind&#039;s eye and to look outwards at what has been trapped inside.<br /><br />TLDR - Don&#039;t go cheap and risk your life messing with NBOMe&#039;s they are honestly the most concerning chemicals around right now.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure people at Bluelight ADD and stuff will look further and continue to study these molecules.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But personally, it&#039;s not worth it.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Buy some LSD, try some AL-LAD, hell even MXE is highly psychedelic once you get used to the confusion and dissociation.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;d say my MXE trip the other night was eerily similar to 100ug&#039;s of good acid, and eerily similar in the patterning, melding, warping, and distorting of objects.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Plus it has an extremely similar head space to LSD with deep introspection and some of the best focus and pain relieving qualities that I&#039;ve seen out of any substance.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Final closing thoughts and conclusions.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Seriously, with the amount of good LSD on Silk Road right now do your self the self justice and pick some up.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are literally FLOODED with AMAZING delicious acid right now.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Damn lucky to have such amazing vendors keeping us going with this constant stream of it right now.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could seriously recommend about 15 vendors right now with my highest stamp of recommendation.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are worried about the time constraints of LSD for some reason and don&#039;t have the full 12+ hours to chill and come down.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then consider looking into AL-LAD, MDA, or the other host of other options that you have at your disposal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All of these vendors deserve your money, for providing us with this beautiful molecule.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Show them the karma and respect that they vastly deserve.&nbsp; Seriously we are blessed at this day in age.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LSD continues to be at the forefront and golden standard it always has and it always will be<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As for what I believe will never be surpassed no matter how hard they keep trying to outskirt the law.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s vitally important that you read up on anything and everything you can.&nbsp; Just because you are young doesn&#039;t mean you should binge and damage your body and mind.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Such vast information on almost all aspects of quality of life improvements, and harm reduction has increased drastically since the early 2000&#039;s.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks in part to Silk Road, Bluelight, and Erowid.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Consider yourself blessed if you just turned 18 and you are growing up during one of the most revolutionary times of our world all thanks to Silk Road.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#039;s a very critical and pivotal moment in the scheme of things, as advances in technology, medicine, and drug research and advancement continue to grow.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NBOMe&#039;s are mainly used for profiteers and sold without regards to their customers well being or safety.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In that regard, I don&#039;t support it even for that fact alone.&nbsp; Selling anything as LSD to anyone who may be unfamiliar with the obvious and vast difference.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can instantly lead to big trouble, very quickly.&nbsp; Especially if they are used to street quality and low dosed blotters.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The blotters are often very unevenly laid, and you can see some tabs advertised as 1000ug&#039;s and you can hit a patch of blotter that is drenched in way over that amount.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think you can begin to see the problem here.&nbsp; I had bought 100 25I-NBOMe tab&#039;s and you know what I took those mother fuckers and threw them into my barbeque pit.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hell I never even asked the vendor for some type of reimbursement for the entire ordeal.&nbsp; Because I&#039;d prefer to stay away from anything remotely associated with NBOMe&#039;s.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**No matter how careful or experienced you are even the most experienced tripper can experience very troubling toxicity and permanent damage to your mind and body.**<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These are highly volatile, unpredictable, and dirty feeling chemicals.&nbsp; You are obviously free to ingest what ever the fuck you want.&nbsp; But you have been warned.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Be safe use LSD should be the slogan for anyone who takes their brain, heart, kidneys, and overall well-being seriously.<br /><br />&nbsp;

				You miss the point.<br /><br />Every psychedelic effects your brain differently and offers different experiences.&nbsp; It&#039;s not that LSD == Better it&#039;s that LSD just isn&#039;t 25c or 25i.<br /><br />You&#039;re also comparing apples to oranges.&nbsp; 25i is a full agonist.&nbsp; 25c is not.&nbsp; I tried both and won&#039;t touch 25i because the down regulation it caused even at low doses I found very scary (I couldn&#039;t make out glossy surfaces for two weeks).&nbsp; 25c on the other hand offers me a different experience then LSD.&nbsp; Do I love LSD?&nbsp; Yes I do.&nbsp; Do I know it&#039;s safer than 25c?&nbsp; Yes I do.&nbsp; Do I believe they both have a place in my medicine cabinet regardless of cost?&nbsp; Yes I do.<br /><br />Now if the main point of this thread is safety and education that&#039;s great.&nbsp; But quite honestly, you...&nbsp; especially you Vanquish, come off like one of those DARE propaganda spreaders I had to deal with in Middle and High School.&nbsp; It sucks that you feel 25i may have damaged your receptors and maybe it did.&nbsp; But you also mention the abuse of MDA and MDMA and how reckless you&#039;ve been with your drug use.&nbsp; And then you go on to attribute properties to LSD that it simply doesn&#039;t have.&nbsp; You&#039;re not being scientific.&nbsp; You&#039;re up on your soap box spewing anecdotes like a preacher and frankly, that&#039;s a bitter pill for anyone to swallow.<br /><br />If you really want to do some good, say your piece and move on.&nbsp; Otherwise I&#039;m going to assume that you&#039;re just feeding your ego.<br /><br />FWIW people attributed all sorts of bizarre negative effects to LSD back in the day too.&nbsp; Nearly all of them were unfounded.<br /><br />*edit*&nbsp; I also find it ridiculous that you go on to recommend MDA, a chemical that is clearly neuro-toxic, for people that don&#039;t have time for a full LSD trip.&nbsp; It&#039;s almost like you have no fucking idea what you&#039;re talking about...<br />

				Closing up shop was not a decision we took lightly.<br />The money from vending was my only source of income, my life in fact. <br />We were at one point arguably the largest vendor on here (top 1%, 100% positive feedback) This should give you an idea of the volume we produced and the income we gave up.

A moderator on Bluelight took a normal dose of 25-c and performed regular blood pressure checks throughout (dangerously high). This was someone with a highly respected experience and understanding of tryps/phens and a decent understanding of neurochemistry and biology. They stated they wouldn&#039;t take it again. I have used the chemical multiple times and never had a bad experience, but I cannot divert my attention from the reports of seizures and deaths that are coming in, and equally importantly, the opinions of highly experienced psychonauts who know their own minds and bodies better than many can ever possibly imagine.<br /><br /><br />2. The second reason I decided to pull away from this is because of first hand experience of the attitudes of the younger generation towards drugs.<br />It can&#039;t be helped, this is just how they are. I gave a strip of 25i to a kid I am still friends with, who I met at a festival. A couple of weeks later he told me, laughing, &#039;I sold that research chemical stuff off to someone - just told them it was acid!&#039;.

Many will disagree with me here - and I fully understand, I was of the former school of thought this time last year.<br /><br />If a chemical becomes something I would not want to share with a loved one, I would no longer wish to share it with the rest of the population, no matter what profit it saw me. There are safer, well researched, much more rewarding chemicals out there. <br /><br />The NBOMe thing became all about profit and no longer about the experience. A cheap thrill being passed around the playground, not a drug that will influence a generation. In fact, for a while there, I knew I was profiting mainly because people were bulk buying my stuff, and reselling it as acid.

I estimate we distributed over 1,000,000 of these things.<br /><br />There were two main issues which influenced my decision to stop.<br /><br />1. It seems that different people have different reactions to this chemical. The odds that you will be the one who reacts badly are tiny, but a party is no longer a party if one person seizes out and dies. <br /><br />Respected psychedelic users from various forums, notably Bluelight, of which I am a member, the shroomery, and other boards have all expressed their concern over this chemical. <br />I believe I am a logical person. I believe I think rationally. I know that many reported cases will involve abnormal factors such as high doses, irresponsible use, polydrug use, etc etc. <br />There are reports of this drug causing seizures and deaths (A few months back, one of our customers sent us a message to say he had experienced a seizure on one tab - no other drugs involved. We brushing it aside and moved along, figuring there must have been some other reason). A moderator on Bluelight took a normal dose of 25-c and performed regular blood pressure checks throughout (dangerously high). This was someone with a highly respected experience and understanding of tryps/phens and a decent understanding of neurochemistry and biology. They stated they wouldn&#039;t take it again. I have used the chemical multiple times and never had a bad experience, but I cannot divert my attention from the reports of seizures and deaths that are coming in, and equally importantly, the opinions of highly experienced psychonauts who know their own minds and bodies better than many can ever possibly imagine.<br /><br /><br />2. The second reason I decided to pull away from this is because of first hand experience of the attitudes of the younger generation towards drugs.<br />It can&#039;t be helped, this is just how they are. I gave a strip of 25i to a kid I am still friends with, who I met at a festival. A couple of weeks later he told me, laughing, &#039;I sold that research chemical stuff off to someone - just told them it was acid!&#039;. I shook my head and just felt sad (yes I did try and explain why this was wrong but it seemed to go over his head)<br /><br />This is the problem we face. It doesn&#039;t matter if I can convince myself, logically, that each and every user should be responsible for identifying the chemical they are about to ingest, and understand the safety aspects of it and the correct dosage, we at the top are feeding a system where we must expect this sort of thing to happen. Many will disagree with me here - and I fully understand, I was of the former school of thought this time last year.<br /><br />If a chemical becomes something I would not want to share with a loved one, I would no longer wish to share it with the rest of the population, no matter what profit it saw me. There are safer, well researched, much more rewarding chemicals out there. <br /><br />The NBOMe thing became all about profit and no longer about the experience. A cheap thrill being passed around the playground, not a drug that will influence a generation. In fact, for a while there, I knew I was profiting mainly because people were bulk buying my stuff, and reselling it as acid. We had messages BEGGING for us to stop printing the chemical name on the back, even offers to pay more if we would do &#039;one last batch without&#039;. Some customers actually became aggressive when we declined. This was not the crowd I wished to deal to, and not the life I want to lead.<br /><br />Those of us in the position to know about these chemicals (and with the intelligence to lay sheets) should also be able to feel when something isn&#039;t quite right.<br /><br />In the end, we flushed around 1.5KG of 25i/c down the toilet (that&#039;s worth over six figures retail) and decided to move on. I want to contribute to the psychedelic community, not take from it.<br /><br />EDIT: To the NBOMe vendors. I am NOT judging you by any means. Our decisions were ours alone and reflect OUR opinion of the situation. Everyone is entitled to their own point of view. I do however urge you to label products correctly and ask yourselves, would you be selling so many if the tabs were clearly labelled and could not be passed off as acid - see the LSZ and AL-LAD tabs for examples. Oh, and laying 25i onto Hoffman or any other print associated with LSD is particularly bad. <br /><br />Peace, everyone. Il be in the office with a changa spliff, reading organic chemistry for dummies and trying to source some ergotamine&nbsp; 8)<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Thanks for the response, I will xpost to bluelight and try and gather further details as to what is causing these issues. I respect your decision to stop selling. But if you&#039;ve 1m tabs and had one bad report that&#039;s only 0.0001%. abstinence is a poor response - this will likely increase further in popularity so harm-reduction is my #1 priority<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Feel the same way.<br />People better start shoving medical records and detailed scientific studies in my face before i jump on the BANdwagon.<br /><br />Other then that,selling it as something lsd should give the seller a bad trip he&#039;ll remember for the rest of his life as negative karma.<br />Worse if it results into bodily harm for the duped buyer.

				really selling a million tabs and one person have an bad reaction like seizing isn&#039;t crazy as far as bad reactions go.&nbsp; I bet a lot of accepted drugs in society prob hurt or cause a serious negative reaction in more then 1 in a million.&nbsp; If you where to invent some new food and one out a million or so people who it have a bad reaction to it does that mean you food is dangerous and no safe for market?&nbsp; What % of kids have nut allergy&#039;s now?&nbsp; I bet it way higher then a few in a million.&nbsp; Yet peanuts still have pretty wide use in our society.&nbsp; We are just aware to some people they can pose a danger and some caution should be took.&nbsp; Thats how I see the 25x series.
