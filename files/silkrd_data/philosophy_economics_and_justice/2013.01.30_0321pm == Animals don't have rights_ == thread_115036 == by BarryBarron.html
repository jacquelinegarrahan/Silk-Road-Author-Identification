				Why?<br /><br />What is it that elevates us above the status of commodity?<br /><br />I reject the religious notion that man is made in gods image. So what separates us from the rest of the organisms?<br /><br />Is it intelligence?<br />So what if a monkey or pig was genetically engineered to have the intelligence of a retarded human? Would that creature have rights like the rest of us?<br /><br />If not then should we really be giving retarded humans rights? I need some sort of argument to resolve this mess...<br /><br />This could have probably been thought out better...&nbsp; :-\

				Humans are animals. I assume you meant non-human animals. I do not think that non-human animals have rights unless they achieve self awareness at the very least, preferably self awareness with some level of intelligence. Dogs do not have self awareness, they are incapable of recognizing themselves in a mirror. I would never harm a dog, actually I like dogs quite a lot. But I do not think that a dog has rights past what its owner gives to it.

				And to say people do? I&#039;ll try not to get all meta and philosophical, I consider most of those arguments whimsical bull; but:<br /><br />To attach important to anything, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, are just abstractions we&#039;ve created, because we value our own happiness - so we say happiness good, unhappiness bad. Some people exploited this and created churches, promising people happiness later, if they did their bidding now. And those few on top got to turn their opinions (abortion, marriage, and ways to exploit money and power for their own convenience) into morals for others to follow.<br /><br />The idea of mutilating puppies is naturally abhorrent to us - but why is their suffering &quot;bad&quot;? Is it because we sympathize, there&#039;s some universal ticker of &quot;unhappiness&quot; that gets added to when we make other people unhappy, and a giant invisible record of &quot;good deeds&quot; that counts how good every living thing in the universe has been?<br />What about squishing ants? They don&#039;t feel pain the way we do; their frantic running around to dodge us is programming to survive. We could make little robots do the same thing, and we might even feel a misplaced sympathy if we interpreted their actions as emotion.<br /><br />So does suffering become bad when the animal feels pain &quot;like we do&quot; - that&#039;s pretty self-centered of us. We say good and bad, the whole moral spectrum, are just extensions of our own drive to be happy and get what we want, programmed into us.<br /><br />At this point, &quot;rights&quot; is ridiculously abstract, just a system we hope to enforce to stop the &quot;bad guys&quot; from hurting the &quot;good guys&quot;, and to protect the happiness of those who might have it taken away. (like puppies)<br /><br />So I&#039;m not even taking a stance on this, I just want to say the argument is only as valid as your certainty that morality is an objective thing in the universe. Puppies feel pain and whimper because they &#039;want&#039; to live, but only because that&#039;s what evolved to be the best survival mechanism. If we created a robot that &quot;wanted&quot; to survive, and would try its hardest to, would it suddenly deserve it?

				Animals are intelligent and emotionally evolved beings - they think and feel. They love, they suffer, they mourn.<br />We are all connected.<br /><br />I totally agree with this.<br />I have read so many stories about animals (mostly mammals) showing the above qualities, yes, maybe animals are not quite as evolved as humans ... but when you see the acts of cruelty inflicted on some animals you do actually wonder where our evolution is taking us &#039;superior&#039; beings. Go to &#039;Animal Cruelty Exposed&#039; on FB and you&#039;ll see what I&#039;m talking about.<br /><br />Where I live there are often articles in the newspaper about dog/cat owners being publicly scrutinised and/or fined/punished for what they have done. Although this does not equate to animal rights it&#039;s certainly going in the right direction and raises awareness.<br /><br />Don&#039;t know where I&#039;d be without my animals&nbsp; :)

				At the very core of it there is no such thing as a &quot;natural&quot; right. The gorilla bear that just spotted you isn&#039;t going to give a damn about your human rights.<br /><br />The rights we have we bestow upon ourselves as (more) intelligent beings than our animal counterparts. We develop these rights over time through a series of agreements (If you live in our tribe you get the protection of our numbers. In return you go out and hunt for food). <br /><br />Expand that into government sized groups and you come up with human rights, animal rights, free speech rights, etc... In return for the rights your government bestows upon you, you agree to certain conditions, which are enforced by law. <br /><br />I&#039;m talking about the concept here people, not about the FUBAR rights seizing organized thieves we have today.<br /><br />But the concept is still sound. Animals can have no rights of their own because they are incapable of entering into or understanding agreements. The only rights they have are those that we and our humanity bestow upon them through our actions or laws. <br /><br />It is after all our oneness with the universe, all living things, God, or the spirit that drives our humanity, our humaneness, to fight for rights these animals aren&#039;t capable of fighting for themselves. That we do as a humanity by enacting law and giving them rights. <br /><br />Unfortunately the slippery slope starts there when it comes to who draws what line and on which subject. Before long half the people are on the government dole trying to control the other half&#039;s lives. And then we end up with this crapfest. <br /><br />These thoughts brought to you by purple kush :)

				Sure animals have rights. They are creatures of nature, the same as we are. They choose to exercise their rights everyday, same as we do. Do we all not have the right to air? Food? Water?

Dogs definitely do recognize the smell of their own piss and will ignore it compared to sniffing out the piss of other dogs, even if that piss is placed somewhere that the dog never put it. I think this alone is pretty good evidence to conclude that dogs are very much self aware.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=115036.msg791638#msg791638">Quote from: weirdal on February 04, 2013, 06:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Animals don&#039;t have &#039;knowledge&#039; per say.&nbsp; The have a memory, but not knowledge.&nbsp; I believe having knowledge implies the ability to reason or follow a line of logic with said experience.

If an animal, benefiting from experience, adapts his actions to varying circumstances, how can you say this is not the ability to reason? This is more than just memory.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=115036.msg791638#msg791638">Quote from: weirdal on February 04, 2013, 06:19 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">That being said, there is something that&#039;s clearly different in all humans from animals.&nbsp; Such has been understood if not spoken for millenia and I&#039;ve seen no evidence to point to the contrary.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Oh? And what is it then? <br /><br />A higher capacity for more complex and abstract reasoning *maybe*. I think the tendency has been to perpetually underestimate the intelligence of animals for millenniums. The goalposts keep moving on what &quot;it&quot; is that separates animals from humans. I remember hearing as recently as 10 years ago that animals were incapable of using tools and that distinguished &quot;us&quot; from &quot;them&quot; until that was observed to be false when some primates were observed using sticks to gauge how deep the water in a lake was before jumping in for a bath and some dominant chimps were observed using sticks to beat females into subservience with.

				It depends which rights, the right to vote? No. The right to not be beaten by their sadistic owner? Yes. The right to not be eaten by a predator? No. <br /><br />Personally I would extend their rights to the right not to be hunted purely for sport. But that is more out of my hate for a waste of resources than my hate for animal cruelty. <br /><br />That said, people who campaign for &quot;animal rights&quot; can go ride their fucking horse off a cliff. They have some serious priority issues because there are some PEOPLE who still do not have any rights and I doubt that there is a country in the world that gives it&#039;s citizens the full spectrum of rights&nbsp; that they deserve. Case and point? The right to use drugs.
