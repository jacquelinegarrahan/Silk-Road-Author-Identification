				The other day I was driving in Maryland not too far from the city of Baltimore on a fairly busy street and I noticed a big SUV that looked like some kind of police vehicle that was folllowing me for some time. Made the same turns I did and was behind me for 10 miles or so. I wasn&#039;t worried because I had no drugs on me and wasn&#039;t doing anything wrong but after one of my left turns I started driving 5 miles an hour under the speed limt and finally the SUV passed me and i saw it said on it &quot;Customs and Border Patrol&quot; and on the front on the side it said &quot;Federal Police&quot; or something like that. Why are there customs and Border Patrol vehicles near Baltimore? And could this federal police officer pulled me over if he wanted to?

				This has been in action since the Patriot Act in 2001 and accelerated under the renewal in 2008 and under Obama in the NDAA.&nbsp; They want you to get use to see this.&nbsp; Police are be coming militarized at an alarming rate.&nbsp; Look at all levels of government buying obscene amounts of ammo and guns preparing for civil unrest.&nbsp; They are buying arms from Warsaw Pact countries, as well as ammo and just destroying, just so we can&#039;t get to it.&nbsp; They want checkpoints between all state lines and Americans getting used to seeing military rolling down our streets in Armored Personnel Carriers and Tanks so when they finally roll in to make this think a totalitarian state, you will see it as just another step and &quot;they hope&quot; we will be too afraid to fight, but the children will grow up and it will be normal and as long as consumerism tells them having the brand name shoes, jeans and iphone is what makes them happy, they will roll over and beg for it once they are told by tyrants on tv that &quot;civil disorder&quot; could result in violence, martial law, and products not getting delivered in the mail and to store shelves, which is what will happen anyway.<br /><br />Brother, glad your eyes are open, unlike most.&nbsp; Educate yourself:<br /><br />Go to: www.infowars.com&nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp; www.prisonplanet.com<br /><br />God bless and hopefully enough of us, the masses, just one percent could stop the full weight of the US Police State.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp; &nbsp;

				+1 for your Karma.<br /><br />By the way, he could arrest you anywhere in the US or at the Borders.&nbsp; The feds don&#039;t need probably cause or warrants, they can just say it is a national security concern and you are fucked.&nbsp; It may not stick in court if they find the product on you, but you will still be arrested, have to post bail, and hire a lawyer.<br /><br />...And if these guys are like most crooked pigs, they will say you swerved, or were not wearing your seatbelt, then after approaching they &quot;thought they smelled something&quot;.&nbsp; Then you are fucked unless you can hire some wiseass Jew lawyer to crawl up their asses and that costs tens to hundreds of thousands.&nbsp; Good luck.

Educate yourself. Then prepare to act. The collapse is coming. You can&#039;t stop it. America and the rest of the world will be rebuilt in the ashes of the New World Order. Sites like SR which allow for the free flow of trade and communication will see to it. And cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be the non-violent means which makes it all possible.

				yeah I&#039;m pretty sure Baltimore has an international airport and that&#039;s more than likely where they are out of ; I live nowhere near any border and 1 of those assholes lives in my apartment complex and guess what I live 5 min from an international airport ; you do know when people come here from different countries they have to go through customs right?

				More then likely they were transporting illegal aliens, from one place to another. I noticed a lot of these too when I was in Florida. in the main cities I mean. I think they have just as much responsibility in removing illegal&#039;s as ICE do. In addition, they all fall under the Homeland Security Division, which that falls under the &#039;Feds&#039; category.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				Boy are both of you off. LE tries this shit all the time. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn&#039;t.<br /><br />When doesn&#039;t it work for the cops? When they lie and can&#039;t get their facts straight. Sometimes their notes are so badly fucked up that the prosecutor will dismiss all charges well before the trial date. I have personally seen this. That is unless the suspect coughed up everything after he was &quot;caught&quot; and an illegal search was done and the drugs seized. Whatever you say CAN and WILL be used against you even if the other shit is thrown out because it&#039;s inadmissible. But if you know your rights and keep your mouth shut you will maximize your chances of beating the rap.<br /><br />All it takes is a competent lawyer who knows the law. Not &quot;wiseass Jew lawyer to crawl up their asses and that costs tens to hundreds of thousands&quot; (funny and anti-semitic seconded) and not a requirement that you be rich to stay out of jail.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">....never drive with product unless you absolutely have to.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Exactly. You have the least rights when driving a car. A little or a lot more when traveling on foot (depending whether you live in a &quot;stop and identify&quot; state or not). And then in your home where you have the most rights by far.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=214478.msg1573321#msg1573321">Quote from: jackofspades on September 29, 2013, 06:57 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=214478.msg1560605#msg1560605">Quote from: anonymousasshit on September 24, 2013, 07:02 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">...And if these guys are like most crooked pigs, they will say you swerved, or were not wearing your seatbelt, then after approaching they &quot;thought they smelled something&quot;.&nbsp; Then you are fucked unless you can hire some wiseass Jew lawyer to crawl up their asses and that costs tens to hundreds of thousands.&nbsp; Good luck.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />AS funny and anti-semetic as that was phrased, it is dead true.
