				I have always connected with the hippie movement and consider myself a neo-hippie even tho I missed it by a few years, so I want to get some opinions about the culture.&nbsp; The 60s in the U.S. were a remarkable time in my opinion, where people started to reject the everyday bullshit so common in society.&nbsp; The youth, with the help of an assortment of easily available drugs began to reconnect with the earth and the universe which opened their eyes to what was really going on in this life, what it really was about.&nbsp; Mine own upbringing and life has led me to this same path and I knew the spirit of the 60&#039;s was still alive, but what I hope to get from this post is a better understanding of what happened after the 60&#039;s.&nbsp; If anyone can share their stories of hippiness and what they have done in their lives to keep this spirit alive, please do so!

				Hippies never really left, but the whole movement has changed/morphed/evolved.<br />The circumstances of the modern youth are radically different than what they were back in the late 50&#039;s early 60&#039;s. All you have to do is go to a rainbow gathering to know that the &quot;movement&quot; really isn&#039;t dead. I think a lot of people get nostalgic for the early days of the hippies but those days are gone forever. I think its up to the modern movement to define who they are and to move forward. There have always been subcultures but the hippie movement was the United States first really overt one. <br /><br />I myself don&#039;t consider myself a hippie and you probably won&#039;t find to many here. Although the people here, like myself, encounter them quite often. I would recommend looking into getting to know local Rainbow Gathering events and family. They are probably much more suited to answer your questions and interact with you on that level. <br /><br />

				My $0.02 is that I find hippies more or less incomprehensible. Pretty much the same as my view of the Occupy crowd.&nbsp; I don&#039;t dislike them or anything, I just don&#039;t really identify with their philosophy. Even when there is some crossover, I don&#039;t associate those intersecting ideas as being hippie-related. A fair majority of the things they were concerned about seem to be irrational, which doesn&#039;t appeal to me at all. e.g. the religious/astrology/spiritualism aspects.<br /><br />I think you probably had to be there at the time, which of course isn&#039;t really possible for 9/10 of people in the forum since that would most likely make them 60 - 80 years old if they were teenagers or in their twenties when it all went down.<br /><br />FWIW, I think the movement probably was a delayed side affect of the Second World War. When entire generations go through a bunch of really horrible shit, the experience + demographic changes probably produce a generation with the urge to disassociate themselves from that world as far as humanly possible. Seems fair enough if you ask me! It&#039;s this kind of flexibility that allows humankind to adapt and renew itself.<br /><br />Secondly, the Communists deliberately used the hippie movement to further their ideals, if you read the literature from intelligence agencies back then you&#039;ll see they were enthusiastic about co-opting such social movements as a way of screwing with the American government. I don&#039;t think this had the desired affect, but the pro-socialism alignment many hippies identified with wasn&#039;t entirely organic, it was partly cynically manufactured by think-tanks behind the Iron Curtain (you see a tiny echo of this in the way the Occupy movement is being co-opted by Marxists/Labor movements today). However I don&#039;t think this could ultimately work. Socialists are almost as leery of Communism as Capitalism when you get right down to it. The hippies were as pleased as everybody else when the Wall fall, it was their victory too. That western culture allows such things as artifacts as blue jeans, punk hairstyles and rock and roll really matters, ask any former resident of the Soviet Union and they&#039;ll tell you the same thing. The hippie movement was not pro-Capitalist, but it was not anti-Western even if they experimented with Eastern philosophies. In fact the conflict between conservatism and liberalism is a staple of Western thought and always has been. This is entirely unlike something like Confucianism, which would never tolerate a hippie movement. Some, but not all of popular Eastern thought is seriously authoritarian. <br /><br />--<br /><br />I think that the concepts of Cypherpunk e.g. BTC, PGP, SR and so forth are likely to go viral in a very big way, that&#039;s starting to happen right now. I know that Cypherpunk is perceived as being extremely cool by unanimous verdict of my younger associates (because it is!). We have a young population growing up who&#039;ve spent their teenage years under various sorts of surveillance, whose parents regularly get urine tests for drugs, who are aware of their being tracked by various mechanisms like credit cards, internet browsing history. Hackers who subvert the system are universally respected for their know-how in youth culture today. Once the average teenager reaches the correct level of sophistication and paranoia in their computer use, it&#039;s almost certain many of them will revolt in some way against the system. Crypto-anarchy fits the bill for both liberal ideals and practical financial reasons. The right mix of political circumstances will plan straight into our cryptopaws. Anonymous are just the first such rebellion I think, this shall be a recurring theme in the years to come. Hacktivism is being misinterpreted as nation state political activism spreading into cyberspace, but this isn&#039;t as important as it&#039;s being made out to be. The vast, vast majority of hackers couldn&#039;t give a fuck about nationalism, at least not of the classical cheer-leading sort anyway.<br /><br />That anarcho-capitalism and anarcho-socialism emphasize the Non-Aggression-Principal is probably strengthened by previous peacenik movements such as the hippies. Admittedly NAP does not mean pacifism, but still. The only real ideological requirement to become a Cypherpunk is to be a libertarian, you could be left or right wing, it doesn&#039;t matter which since this is a common ground between us. Here and now the State is the biggest problem there is. Get rid of State power and the majority of monopolies and oligarchies shall fall too, it&#039;s a win-win situation from the libertarian perspective.<br /><br />Lest we forget, PGP itself was invented by Phil Zimmerman, whose motivation at the time was to help anti-nuclear protesters. So, the hippie movement and cypherpunk are definitely linked, even if I don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; the first one.

				+1 to you pine.&nbsp; I always respect and enjoy your post!&nbsp; You hit so many great points and I love the use of historical examples.&nbsp; I will be bookmarking the thread.<br /><br />I think you find hippies incomprehensible because their ideas were not fully formed.&nbsp; I do think they played an important role in history because of the press they received globally.&nbsp; Every generation rebels, buy I would say until the hippie movement none had rebelled in such a way that captured peoples attention and imagination in the U.S. and the world.&nbsp; As a movement they were doomed.&nbsp; The ideals and leadership of the movement were weak and of course this allowed for many other factions to use them in whatever ways they wanted too. <br /><br />The first reply poster mentioned that the movement has evolved and I am of this opinion myself!&nbsp; I see the links as you do pine, with the cypherpunk movement and the hippie movement.&nbsp; In this day and age this is the &quot;cool&quot; rebellious thing to be apart of.&nbsp; I can only hope that this time lessons have been taken from past rebellious generations like the hippies and we go about creating change in an intelligent manner.<br /><br />Thanks for the replies!

				The Hippies and the movement never really left. You&#039;ll still find hippie out there and it&#039;s just nowadays the movement has evolved and branched off into different subcultures with different principles and philosophy.

				the term hippie is mostly cliche.&nbsp; I do harbor the hippie spirit; but my definition of a hippie is likely completely different than the next guy.&nbsp; I am a thinking hippie, likened to advanced thinkers like alex grey, paul laffoley, and ananda bossman.&nbsp; I have a deep respect for eastern and western practices.. the spirit within the hippie movement isn&#039;t dead at all, it just advanced past the interest and understanding of most people.&nbsp; The psuedo hippies are a huge turn off to me; they seem largely hollywood created drug addicts.

				But Lucius&#039; term makes sense- he/she is a person who is open to experience and has a worldview that hopes for mutual compassion, and is also into the &#039;hippie&#039; aesthetic (so I infer from the post). &#039;Hippie&#039; IS an aesthetic now, particularly for people who think beyond the terms of caricatures (I contend most do), one that I too value and identify with. I spend my time seeing Phish and Furthur, I take LSD, I play in jam bands, I have a wild mane of unkempt hair. It&#039;s a good time and fairly little politics are involved, or at least the lack of involvement is more overt now. 99% of the kids wearing tie dye in the 60s/70s were the same type of those 99% who now wear large glasses and condom-like toques, in that they wear what everyone who shops at the same mall wears. <br /><br />I would also like to point out the roots of the hippie aesthetic in the Romanticism period of the Western canon. It&#039;s nothing too new, the sentiment of the experiences are the same. The outcome wasn&#039;t too different either, the lifestyle appealed to bourgeois &quot;decadents&quot; and the pendulum swung back in favour of rationalism. <br /><br />edit: And I&#039;m sure that, if we broaden the query, we can extend the roots as far back as evidence allows.

I haven&#039;t read all of the posts, just putting in my 2 cents.<br /><br />The hippie &#039;movement&#039; attempted to break away and live outside of the structures of power, in a response to state repression, by focusing on the self.<br /><br />Corporations and markets responded to this new type of consumer, and invented products that people could buy to express their individuality. This was the beginning of lifestyle marketing, and the way in which we learnt to express ourselves through manufactured objects.<br /><br />The hippie &#039;lifestyle&#039; became just another product you could buy, just like the punk &#039;lifestyle&#039; would years later.<br /><br />I think it would be extremely difficult for any subculture today to avoid this, unless it remains extremely small (and therefore leads to no change, anyway). Marketing is constantly on the look out for the next big thing, and whenever it comes along, they are never far behind. <br /><br />I&#039;d like to see something new, something not trying to repeat a nostalgic version of the past, that places individual expression alongside collective action and I&#039;d love for LSD to be involved in some way or another. But I don&#039;t think any of that is very likely under current conditions.<br /><br />TLDR

				Yeah I think that&#039;s fair enough! But wouldn&#039;t you say the hippie movement itself was kind of new at the time, or if not, what do you think it was recycling? <br /><br />My thoughts here are what was new about the hippie movement was placing your &#039;self&#039; at the centre, and self expression as one of the highest ideals. In that sense, that was the pure movement. And the pure movement, or what made it new at least, has been absorbed by business. Self expression is one of the highest ideals in mainstream culture now, it&#039;s just that we do it through products, be they clothes, fashion styles, furniture, cars, alternative medicine etc. There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with this, but I think it&#039;s failed as a vehicle for genuine social change. But hey, maybe that&#039;s not everyone&#039;s intention anyway I guess, although I think it was with the initial movement.<br /><br />And don&#039;t get me wrong about nostalgia. I have a totally romanticized version of the 60s and that culture in my head, I just think any movement that ends up effect social change now will be quite different to the hippie one. And I don&#039;t think the hippie movement totally failed. There&#039;s been massive changes in attitude of the populations of western populations to racism, sexism, homophobia, war etc. since the 60s which is amazing. It just didn&#039;t really effect the structures of power.<br /><br />You should just watch the Century of the Self on youtube, that&#039;s where a good chunk of my argument is stolen from!

				Thanks for the recommendation. I&#039;ve heard mixed reviews and have been meaning to watch it, almost as much as I&#039;ve been meaning to try DMT.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really disagree with anything you&#039;ve said there! Although I do actually think the focus on the self as expressed through consumerism is massively problematic, but I don&#039;t at all &#039;blame&#039; hippie culture for that. Anyway, nice chattin to ya man. Hope you enjoy the documentary!

				I feel the same about consumerism as you do!&nbsp; You enjoy DMT as well, the doc and the drug.&nbsp; I&#039;m also in the same boat as you on the DMT, can&#039;t wait to try, and the documentary is to blame.&nbsp; Looking for a good vendor, let me know if you find one before I do and I will return the favor.&nbsp; Peace<br /><br />
