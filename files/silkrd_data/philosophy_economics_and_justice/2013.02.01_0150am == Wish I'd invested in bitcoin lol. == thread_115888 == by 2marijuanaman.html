				Remember when bitcoins were like $2.80? Before I came along, they were even cheaper, weren&#039;t they?&nbsp; ::) I could&#039;ve turned my money over tenfold in a year. Perhaps it&#039;s not too late. That&#039;s the thing though, there&#039;s no way to know how it will change. I&#039;d like to hear from anyone who DID invest. You clever motherfuckers.

				I wish i had the money to invest! I do have 4.15btc sitting in my wallet and im not going to touch them till the price skyrockets. Imagine buying an ounce of weed for 4btc?! It is still worth buying now and keeping them for a few months imo.

				I was just pondering the same thing<br />I first got some coins when they were like 8 or 9 dollars, only 6 months ago around August... even then it would have been a solid investment!!! i dont even want to think about the people who invested a lot when it was 1 or 2 dollars... haha, good for them though i suppose : )<br />I just hope the security and strength stays intact the more coins that are mined and the higher the price goes up and of course as the paper currency war rages on... <br />so i can keep using them and this wonderful site =DD<br />cheers<br /><br /><br />_seshat

				I hear you.<br /><br />I kinda accidentally invested by buying a lump sum of BTC when I first made it to SR<br />but then I let a good chunk of it just sit in my wallet<br />checked back many months later and I had about tripled my money<br /><br />but then I just used the earnings to buy more drugs, so not really a successful investment story&nbsp; ;D

				Not too late. People will be saying the same thing years from now. There&#039;s not a better investment based on return that I can think of other than maybe drugs haha
