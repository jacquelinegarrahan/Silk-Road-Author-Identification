				Hello all, after a spot of afternoon tea with several friends and associates we stumbled onto the discussion of responsibility, more specifically the morality of working for an arms manufacturer.<br />I also thinks this kind of ties in with the thread about payback for those fighting in the war on drugs, or doesn&#039;t I&#039;m not sure. <br />Basically the question we discussed is if you work for an arms manufacturer say BAE systems, no matter what position or level (executive - production line hand) you are effectively saying you agree with the killing of another human for gain, now there are lots of industries both illegal and legal that participate in the killing of people for profit but we chose this as its a world wide legal business that is financed by some of the worlds oldest and &quot;friendly&quot; institutions, (many of us use banks that have billion £/$ shares in these cooperation) and in its machine are blue collar workers who would no more shoot someone in the face than drop a depleted uranium tipped shell on a village, but they continue to work and assemble these weapons.<br /><br />Do we believe that all those in the chain are as guilty as the leader that oks the use of the weapons, if there is a maker/god/big guy will he judge you on this or will it be a case of &#039;alright son, you had to feed your family&#039;.<br /><br />Also as this is my 100th post I&#039;m going to issuing karma hard until the novelty wares off, assuming people reply that is....

				No. The people who took the action that caused harm bear full responsibility, not those people who built the tool used in the crime. The majority of the world&#039;s population is not wealthy enough to have the luxury of &quot;voting with their labor&quot; in various companies and industries about policy decisions above their paygrade. To say a worker at a firearm factory is morally wrong in doing his job to provide for his family because of how the product he makes is used would be illogical.

				Interesting post... I&#039;ve thought about this quite a bit. For a living I sell (let&#039;s be generic for relative anonymity) military electronics that are used primarily on sea-going vessels. BAE may even be one of my customers (who knows?!). I am vehemently Libertarian and anti unjust war. So you see... this kind of creates this odd personal philosophical dilemma for me. I mean how many people in the world can look at the news when the US or one of her allies fires a bad tomahawk missile into a crowded middle eastern hospital or apartment complex and say, &quot;I could have very easily had a hand in that.&quot; Without me and people like me, there would be no switch to flip... there would be no targeting interface... there would be no missile... And those people wouldn&#039;t be dead. I came to the conclusion that there is no guilt if there are no true morals. There are only the victors in society and those who have been vanquished. The strong create the rules and decide what is moral. If this is the case and morality is subjective... how can there be guilt? You are only as guilty as the set of morals **you believe are true** say you are.

Giving a group you know is trying to use it like that isn&#039;t the same as what I outlined above. If you sold aluminium to the US is that wrong too because that aluminium may be used to make bombs? A hydrogen bomb is on a whole new scale and this isn&#039;t a 1 size fits all solution, you have to base each case on its own merits and the example you gave is pretty poor attempt to explain logic as you&#039;ve heavily misinterpreted my wording. Hence my phrase &quot;it simply depends on the intentions of the user&quot;.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Aluminium, hammers, and other tools that CAN be used for murder are different from bombs and guns, whose SOLE purpose is to murder...

				I think this topic is kind of ironic considering it&#039;s been posted on SR - and this is my thoughts on why it is ironic: most of the people here posting on this forum have happily spent their money, bitcoins whatever to buy drugs. I guess I shouldn&#039;t explain to anyone here where some of this stuff comes from and at what price. If you have bought coke here, I think there is a pretty big chance that you have been indirectly financing murderers who kill for profit. I&#039;ve lived in one of those countries for a while (not gonna name the exact location but Mexico should be sufficient). Anyways, if you feel comfortable contributing to that, you can also happily work for a gun manufacturer. Obviously the situation is very different and comparing those 2 things is ridiculous, because we have been forced to get substances like that and &quot;politics&quot; have created that monster that operates like those cartels do in Mexico. But there are some similarities - our society is built that way - we &quot;need&quot; money to eat and make a living - so again, getting a job is a must for most people. I have a technical degree and honestly I have thought about working for such companies (it&#039;s really not that easy cause you have to pass a lot of psychological tests and background checks etc.). I don&#039;t think I want to because it&#039;s just not what I want to do for the rest of my life, but I&#039;m sure not all guns are used for the murder of innocent people - so I don&#039;t really think there is just a default guilt for working there. Personally I&#039;d feel more guilty buying coke or weed from Latin America because I&#039;ve seen in which conditions those are manufactured (at least weed) and I&#039;ve seen the price that is being paid every day with seriously fucked up violence. But that&#039;s just my 2 cents .. I hope nobody feels offended by it.

I came to the conclusion that I only accept criticism to my lifestyle from people who live naked in the woods and produce everything for themselves :D But this is kinda far off from where the topic started, so regarding gun laws - again I completely agree - glad I live in the EU where guns basically don&#039;t exist for &quot;normal&quot; people and gun violence is really rare. On the other hand it&#039;s the same as with prohibiting drugs - you can try to outlaw whatever you want but as long as there&#039;s a demand it won&#039;t work and people will find a way around it. I don&#039;t think it makes a difference if you get stabbed to death with a kitchen knife or shot down by a handgun - violence will always occur, especially in a society that has more and more failed to provide moral values. You can&#039;t take any government serious who claims that it outlaws drugs for the&nbsp; safety of citizens and at the same time not only receives blood money with cigarette and alcohol taxes but also creates drug violence in the first place.<br />But there&#039;s still hope.. considering what world mankind lived in 100 years ago and where we are now, I&#039;m sure things are going to change eventually.<br /><br />Another thing I would like to point out is that the need for protection (through military means)&nbsp; is also caused by the fact that we live in a globalized world but at the same time have very different concepts of society and &quot;evolution&quot;. Even if western countries reach the point where they realize drugs are awesome, guns are useless and so on...&nbsp; I don&#039;t think it would be a smart idea to just have no army or defense research. I don&#039;t think Asian or Middle Eastern countries would just go along - it doesn&#039;t work now by force (Iraq, Afghanistan .. ) and it sure won&#039;t work with no force. It&#039;s a process they have to go through on their own after realizing they are not free. <br /><br />Anyways, thanks for posting this thread, although answers come slow, it&#039;s one of the most interesting threads I&#039;ve read here so far.
