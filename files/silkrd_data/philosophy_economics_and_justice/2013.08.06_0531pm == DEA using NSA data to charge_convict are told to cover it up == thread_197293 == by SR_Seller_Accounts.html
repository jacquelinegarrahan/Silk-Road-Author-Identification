				We are witnessing the annihilation of Due process.<br /><br />CLEARNET WARNING<br /><br />http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: Nancy Gertner</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">&quot;I have never heard of anything like this at all,&quot; said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011. Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the National Security Agency has been collecting domestic phone records. The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists; the DEA program targets common criminals, primarily drug dealers.<br /><br />&quot;It is one thing to create special rules for national security,&quot; Gertner said. &quot;Ordinary crime is entirely different. It sounds like they are phonying up investigations.&quot;<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />&nbsp;and here is Wolf BLitzer talking about it on CNN&#039;s Situation Room<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RYMxcTkTsA<br /><br />
