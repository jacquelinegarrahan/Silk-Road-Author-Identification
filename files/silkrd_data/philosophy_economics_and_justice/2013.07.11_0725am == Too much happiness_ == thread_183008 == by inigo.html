				Is there such a thing as being too happy?&nbsp; ???<br /><br />Or, is it important to have a bit of a somber attitude mixed into your outlook on life to really appreciate and grasp the more serious realities of the world we live in? People are treated all the time for depression, being too unhappy. But I wonder if anyone get&#039;s treated for the opposite? I wonder how many therapists get clients who come to them because they are too fucking happy, and it&#039;s ruining their lives. Is there a &#039;depressant&#039; pill that does the opposite of prozac and brings down your chirpiness?

				I consider myself a happy person. I like to smile a lot and enjoy life. But I think life takes care of being &quot;too happy&quot;. Life is a contant struggle. <br /><br />Its important to have perspective and appreciate and be thankful for the happiness you&#039;ve been blessed with, because there is so much suffering in the world. And because life is so short.<br /><br />Peace<br />;D<br /><br />

				Hm nice question.<br /><br />Well first of all I don&#039;t think there is a depression pill. But if it exists, well thats freaking awful.<br />Now I find hard to understand to term &quot;too happy&quot;. <br />Generally I would say that is nothing wrong with it. In my personal and professional I tend to tell be to be happy and try blocking their negative thoughts and emotions. Some say that I am too happy or live in my own fairytale world, but I just say that I am just a simple guy that knows how to block the negatives out of my head. <br /><br />But on the other hand I can easily imagine people who because of mental abnormalities are in a state of extra happiness. <br />For example seeing people dying, begging etc that makes them laugh or at least not sad. But I can&#039;t say that this is happiness, it is mental disorder.<br /><br />The trick of happiness as Rastaman Vibration correctly said, is to be thankful and appreciate your every surroundings.<br /><br />So to end my thesis I would say that in my opinion there is not such thing as being too happy, and if anyone needs psychiatric help because he is too happy, well the answer is that he isn&#039;t that happy.<br /><br />All the best people,<br /><br />Adamiz

				I suffer from this and I will tell you what the depressant pill is.&nbsp; It is other people who are unhappy and can&#039;t stand to see others happy.&nbsp; These people do their best to project their awful outlook on to the happy ones.&nbsp; &nbsp;The unhappy definitely outweigh the happy, so it&#039;s very hard to suffer from too much happiness, there are many checks and balances out there!&nbsp; It&#039;s a fun battle tho&nbsp; &nbsp;;D

				I think there definitely can be such a thing. I feel as though some people subconsciously create problems for themselves because they realize on some level they lack any drama in their life and seek it out in order to be &quot;normal&quot;

				I feel that happiness is in a way chemically based. In that way, sadness and low feelings can come from a lack of the chemicals required to be happy. Imagine any number of situations that can cause a person to be sad, and try to picture someone immune to them. If you can picture someone immune to the reality of mortality, of the risk of disaster, of the disappointments of their human lives, then that person is probably a work of fiction. Or ignorant/brainwashed to ignore those facts. <br /><br />That is my take on someone who is &quot;too&quot; happy, just as someone can be &quot;too&quot; depressed (as in suicidal levels).<br /><br />Now of course a person can be incredibly happy and for long periods of time. I have been that person. But the reality is that things are saddening just as they are encouraging. If a person feels that they are &quot;too happy,&quot; they seek balance over imbalance. <br /><br />If someone described above does exist: Maybe they know that being as happy as they are isn&#039;t sustainable and they don&#039;t want to be that imbalanced for too long, lest they forget what reality is? They might see each and every sadness as a magnified depression.<br />

				Except for mental disorders its not likely to happen. Humans (like any animal) are programmed to resist/fight against challenges we experience. Even if that challenge is as ridiculous as some of our problems in todays world.<br /><br />Its all about perspective. <br /><br />Most of us ought to be extremely happy with the hand we were given in life...imagine how bad it could have been? and yet..not so easy.

				Not sure, I think the two go hand in hand, some of the time your happy and some of the time your a bit low or sad and more specifically you sometimes want to be sad, maybe your family member passed and you want time to cry and grieve, imagine you were constantly happy you would go down like a lead balloon at funerals.<br /><br />I am a lot happier since I found sr thats for sure, its a lot easier for me to accept my physical health issues now I have access to some of the finest quality cannabis around, its out there you just have to look.<br /><br />Right now I am happy, always looking forward and never back, its the only way to live your life.

Wikipedia defines it as &quot;a state of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, arousal, and/or energy levels.&quot;<br /><br />What Inigo is looking for is somewhere between euthymia and euphoria.<br /><br />Interestingly, whether you win millions of dollars in the lottery or become paralyzed in a car accident, most people return to their baseline mood within a few months, which is probably mostly genetically determined.<br />

				I say find this person with so much happiness its ruining their life and work out what their brain is producing too much of and you&#039;ll probably eventually find something much better than prozac for ppl with depression.<br /><br />I&#039;m yet to meet such a person though, even the people that should (outside looking in) be the happiest, tend to be depressed.<br /><br />Its depressing to think about, lol.<br /><br />
