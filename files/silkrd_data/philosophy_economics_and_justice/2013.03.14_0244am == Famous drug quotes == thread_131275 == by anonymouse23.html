				I wouldn’t recommend sex, drugs or insanity for everyone, but they’ve always worked for me.<br /><br />Reality is a crutch for people who can’t cope with drugs.<br /><br />I feel sorry for people who don’t drink. They wake up in the morning and that’s the best they’re going to feel all day.<br /><br />I tried sniffing Coke once, but the ice cubes got stuck in my nose.<br /><br />I’ve never had a problem with drugs. I’ve had problems with the police.<br /><br />In the 1960s, people took acid to make the world weird. Now the world is weird, and people take Prozac to make it normal.<br /><br />God made pot. Man made beer. Who do you trust?<br /><br />Cocaine is God’s way of saying you’re making too much money.<br /><br />I used to have a drug problem…..now I make enough money. <br /><br />No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we’re looking for the source of our troubles, we shouldn’t test people for drugs, we should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and love of power.<br /><br />Pharmaceutical companies will soon rule the world if we keep letting them believe we are a happy, functional society so long as all the women are on Prozac, all children on Ritalin, and all men on Viagra.<br /><br />Drugs are very much a part of professional sports today, but when you think about it, golf is the only sport where the players aren’t penalized for being on grass.<br /><br />Drugs have taught an entire generation of American kids the metric system.<br /><br />Drugs may be the road to nowhere, but at least they’re the scenic route.

I was drowning in a sea of liquor. And I washed up on a beach made of cocaine. The sky was made of LSD. And every tree was made of marijuana! But the cops pulled me over. But they did not arrest me. They sucked my dick! and when they were done draining every last drop of cum out of my cock, God came down from heaven. He said to me &#039;Marilyn Manson, we will no longer spell the word &#039;G,O,D.&#039;<br />And I said &#039;well how do you want to spell it, God?&#039;<br />He said &#039;Give me a D! Give me an R! Give me a U! Give me a G! Give me an S!&#039; <br />And what does that spell?&quot;<br />-Marilyn Manson<br /><br />&quot;We&#039;ll have a cigar, some wine, juke, joke, jive, socialize, blow dope, snort coke, and practice your stroke.&quot;<br />-Doug Casey<br /><br />&quot;Psychedelics both require and produce a transformative effect.&quot;<br />Neil Goldsmith

				To cure the junkie and the alcoholic, you must humbly admit that he is a more deeply spiritual person than you, and you accept the cosmic validity of his search to transcend the game, and you help him see that blackout drugs are just bad methodology because you just can&#039;t keep holding the &quot;off&quot; switch and that the way to reach the void is through psychedelic rather than anesthetic experience.<br /><br />Timothy Leary

				“We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.<br />Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.”<br />― Hunter S.

				My own personal favourite:<br /><br /><br />&quot;That humanity at large will ever be able to dispense with Artificial Paradises seems very unlikely. Most men and women lead lives at the worst so painful, at the best so monotonous, poor and limited that the urge to escape, the longing to transcend themselves if only for a few moments, is and has always been one of the principal appetites of the soul. Art and religion, carnivals and saturnalia, dancing and listening to oratory--all these have served, in H. G. Wells&#039;s phrase, as Doors in the Wall. And for private, far everyday use there have always been chemical intoxicants. All the vegetable sedatives and narcotics, all the euphorics that grow on trees, the hallucinogens that ripen in berries or can be squeezed from roots--all, without exception, have been known and systematically used by human beings from time immemorial. And to these natural modifiers of consciousness modern science has added its quota of synthetics--chloral, for example, and benzedrine, the bromides and the barbiturates.<br /><br />Most of these modifiers of consciousness cannot now be taken except under doctor&#039;s orders, or else illegally and at considerable risk. For unrestricted use the West has permitted only alcohol and tobacco. All the other chemical Doors in the Wall are labeled Dope, and their unauthorized takers are Fiends.&quot;<br /><br />Aldous Huxley - Doors of Perception
