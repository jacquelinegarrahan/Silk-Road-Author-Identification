				the anonymity which characterised the web for a long time is obviously bothering certain people a lot. <br /><br />I notice a lot of progressive leftist types are promoting the notion that if you are posting anything online, you should use your real name - &quot;what do you have to hide?&quot;<br /><br />Google wants to herd people into their Google+ matrix.&nbsp; It&#039;s a constant push to get people to be more managable and captive on the web <br /><br />The Xbox One was launched with a lot of restrictions and attempts to impose spy tech but the public told them to stuff it and they back down for now.<br /><br />How about how they ask if you recognize people from photos? Creepy <br /><br />The problem is all sorts of software and hardware will be developed either by governments or nosy marketers and they&#039;ll swap techniques, data and tools back and forth till they know as much as they possibly can about us personally and as groups.<br /><br />

				The real problem is, that we have made the world a place where it is necessary to have to hide from other people!
