				Hope is a delusion.<br /><br />It is only when you realize you are in total control of your actions and the consequences thereof, this truth will become clear. <br /><br />If you hope for a certain favorable outcome of a certain action, you failed to plan adequately and are instead relying upon things outside of your control.<br /><br />A delusion<br /><br />People fell for the Obama Hope delusion, because they expected a good outcome based on the actions of someone else.
