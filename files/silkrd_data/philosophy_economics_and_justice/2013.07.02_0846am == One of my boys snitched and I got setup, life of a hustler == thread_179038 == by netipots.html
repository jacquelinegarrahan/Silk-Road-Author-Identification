				For half year I was pushing slowly with few trusted friends, not knowing the 1 of the friend that I trusted would let me down for the time that we had put into this business, and he would snitch on me and set me up. Just so he wouldn&#039;t get in trouble. Eventually I got caught up with a 1LB of bud. The police don&#039;t like me they are disrespectful. They don&#039;t realize they will I be replaced by other drug dealers its a never ending cycle. <br /><br />Any advice. I&#039;ve talked to a lawyer who wants 4k and will drop it down to misdemeanor + couple days in jail + probation + community service. <br /><br />I&#039;ve realized it could have been worse. Anyways any tips on how to make this go smoothly.<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Netipots

				Not all attorneys are equal.<br /><br />My point is, maybe talk to a couple other attorneys, see what they say.&nbsp; Cant hurt.<br /><br />If the worst you have to take is a misdemeanor, few days in jail, a loss of $4K etc., consider your self lucky.&nbsp; What&#039;s important is avoiding a felony, all else is inconsequential.<br /><br />To make things go smoothly:&nbsp; obviously don&#039;t get caught for other shit while you&#039;re fighting this case, or while on probation for that matter.&nbsp; Mind you, you&#039;re now in their system and this shit will come up whenever you/your plates are run... expect to be pulled over and mandatorily searched on a regular basis.&nbsp; (I have to put cars in other people&#039;s names that don&#039;t have a record)<br /><br />If you have to do some time... just be like every other fucker in there, you don&#039;t want to be there.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be a pussy and let yourself get pushed around, but don&#039;t be feel-strong either... be cool.&nbsp; No need for you to be blabbing about yourself constantly... it&#039;s better to remain somewhat a mystery.&nbsp; You don&#039;t want to be an easy read, or easily sized up.&nbsp; Learn from your cellie.&nbsp; Take everything others tell you/ask you to do etc. with a grain of salt though.&nbsp; Don&#039;t be stupid, and look out for yourself... cause most likely, nobody else will.&nbsp; If you&#039;re only doing a few days, you&#039;ll be fine... you&#039;ll most likely get placed in minimum security with others just like you, not killers.<br /><br />Best of luck, man.&nbsp; Stay strong.

				Shit, man. Betrayal sucks. I think the worst part of your story is the part about being sold out like that. <br /><br />You&#039;ll be okay though. Far better get the lesson now than later, when you might have been caught with 1000 lbs rather than one. <br /><br />If you want to continue in the business, get the best lawyer you can afford. (Same goes if you want to go straight - felonies are not career friendly). Having a clean or close to clean record is important as sentencing is always worse for prior offenders. If you can get off with a few days in jail you&#039;re lucky. <br /><br />Don&#039;t get too down on yourself! As you said it could have been worse. Remember that in a year or two the whole thing will just be another story &amp; you&#039;ll be back out &amp; life will be even better than you were before you got caught. Promise. :)<br /><br />Hang in there... and if you can please let us know how it goes.

				I&#039;ve never been in your situation but have known some people that have and have seen differing results and it mostly comes down to the attorney and how the judge/prosecutor will perceive you and your impact on the community in the past and going forward.<br /><br /><br />Do your due diligence when it comes to obtaining an attorney.&nbsp; If you know anyone that works in the legal system, ask them for referrals.&nbsp; I would search really hard to find a pitbull that does criminal cases in that court district.&nbsp; Make sure the lawyer has a working relationship with he judges and prosecutor in whatever place your case will be.&nbsp; That can go a long way in getting a better deal.&nbsp; If your attorney doesnt know the judge and prosecutor, he isnt going to be able to pull any favors.&nbsp; A friend of mine should have done time but got off with probation because his attorney played golf regularly with the prosecutor and judge.&nbsp; If you can find an attorney that is also a judge, that would be ideal.&nbsp; Another friend basically got off because his lawyer was a judge in a small town on the side.<br /><br />If you have character witnesses that can help you out like a pastor, someone that works with a charity, teacher, or anyone else that holds a respectable position like that, talk to them and see if they will testify or submit a letter to the judge and/or prosecutor on your behalf.&nbsp; If you have ever done any charity work, get proof of it.<br /><br />Make sure your taxes are up-to-date, cars properly registered, and all that kind of stuff.&nbsp; They check that kind of stuff and not having your shit in order will be held against you.<br /><br />Lastly, always dress appropriately for court and be courteous and polite.&nbsp; I have seen way too many people end up with a far more severe sentence because they wore jeans and a t-shirt to court or they were just very arrogant and rude to the judge.&nbsp; You probably didnt need to be told his but I see it everytime I go to court and it never goes well for that person so apparently this isnt common sense.&nbsp; It is so easy to do this and could be the difference between prison and probation.

				I&#039;m lucky as all my real life go to guys (and girls) are 100%. They live local so they need that reputation of not folding under pressure and handing over anyone else.<br /><br />Were I live now is far from the crowded cities. I keep my drug use low profile and NEVER ask for drugs nor offer any because I don&#039;t know a lot of the people apart from close neighbours. <br /><br />Funny incident, a few months after moving, I&#039;m sneaking out into the garden which overlooks a bit of a wood. I head to a log I sit on - my woodland throne, and I hear a crack and smell the distinctive odour of some good bud! My neighbour, who is way over 60, came over, with his dog. I took a few more weeks before I felt safe enough to confess that I also enjoyed a little smoke. <br /><br />Turns out half the village is on something or other.&nbsp; ;D<br /><br />But its more dicreet than the city were people do just roam the streets with cans and smoke weed openly, which is not good as children are monkey see and monkey do. You hide that joint from children, cops and anyone you don&#039;t know really. <br /><br />Kept me with a clean record. <br /><br />Also, being from the UK we don&#039;t have the USA culture in which the cops offer deals so much. And even if they did I&#039;d turn it down, do my time and at least be able to walk with my head high. Even cops hate informants. They use them for sure but nobody likes a rat. <br /><br />Hope all goes well for you my man. Guess you live and learn. Buy your bud here instead! Drop address with valid name. Even if the vendor was caught and offered a deal - you&#039;d be relaxing, sunbathing, sad at the loss of whatever but free! <br /><br />Having some buddies who have served 10+ years, I know one thing, it sucks to see your kids grow up from behind bars. Its hard to keep your women - she really has to be in love with you to wait that long. But, you can smuggle your sperm out and in open prisons you can slip out and meet up for a good old love session in a car. I&#039;ve provided that service for a buddy. Drove his wife to a certain open prison, and went to the pub for a meal and some soft drinks whilst love was made! <br /><br />Made sure they aired it out.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />Prison in the USA is different. All that race shit going on. We have a bit of that here now sadly, more religion than race when years ago every prisoner kind of got along with fellow prisoners. Too many informants, sex offenders and heroin/crack heads in there today. It sucks for that now as well as not having your loved ones around you and being able to be there for them.<br /><br />Sucks that a bit of bud is reason enough to do time. I&#039;m glad I&#039;m just a user but I do thank the good dealers out there who play fair, on weight and sell quality bud. <br /><br />Wish you all the best netipots. Hope you get some community service hours or whatever - probation maybe. Sucks to give urine tests but good to have a break from the bud. NEVER sell bud when high. Tried that once, sold lots but never made the count! lol.

				I would also check the background on your lawyer, how many cases like yours has he gotten a favorable judgement, how long he has been doing it, etc.&nbsp; Also his relationship with the states attorney and his knowledge of the judges in your jurisdiction.&nbsp; Sometimes these things all come down to negotiating, if he knows all the players and what their usual moves are then you stand a better chance.

				This is why I carefully decide which &quot;friends&quot; I tell about illegal activities.&nbsp; Some are not trust worthy, others are just big mouthed/dumb and will shout it out. It&#039;s a shame.<br />Wish you all the best netipots.<br />

				Thanks for all the positive vibe, I&#039;ve took breaks before so this shouldn&#039;t be hard just a mental thing. I&#039;ve got no girl or kids at the moment so I&#039;m happy I did this when I was young. Or else I would have regret it later in life.<br /><br />Thanks again for all the input I&#039;ve received. I&#039;ve earned more respect since this situation happened. It&#039;s the struggle of getting caught in the system that&#039;s broken. People take advantage of peoples trust. I made this guy money and he in-turn rips me off and sells me out, there should be no world for these type of people. <br /><br />Loyalty &amp; Respect &amp; Peace<br /><br />-netipots

				Not much to add except good luck. I&#039;ve got a good friend doing a long bid in the pen, and have been to visit him a few times. Not a good place to live, obviously, so I&#039;d do what you can to avoid the place like the plague. Really sorry to hear that you got snitched on by a former friend, that surely must add quite a sting to the burn.
