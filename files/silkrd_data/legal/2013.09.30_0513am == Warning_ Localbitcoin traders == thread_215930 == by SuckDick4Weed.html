				Just a warning to all about BTC traders having their accounts suspended or restricted. This includes seized payments and some banks now requiring ID for teller cash deposits.<br /><br />I learnt the hard way :/

				Please provide more info. without giving yourself away.<br /><br /><br />What bank? What source for buying coins? Anything else suspicious with the account that would get it seized or frozen?<br />

				I don&#039;t see why this would happen. Couldn&#039;t the bank account owner just explain their buying and selling BTC and provide proof of doing so? There&#039;s nothing wrong with that.

				I&#039;d prefer not going into specifics. A trader has stated on their page the new rules regarding one of their banks in Australia for cash deposits.<br /><br />Actually, I don&#039;t think their bank seized the payment. Looking more like mine. So just be careful where you&#039;re sending cash.

				Some more information please? This kinda concerns me as a I rely on localbtc for all my bitcoin purchases... I do cash deposits to banks (cash checking deposit to seller). I am in the US.&nbsp; I dont sell though... Do I have anything to be worried about? They dont ask for ID. I did mention to the teller that its a deposit for a friend or someone else, is that bad?? Even if they know its for bitcoins I dont see how any law is being broken? please give some more info if you can... and is this only in aus so far?

				you know banks are private companies and can refuse service to anyone they want right? <br /><br />&quot;oh no that&#039;s not fair. they can&#039;t do that&quot; <br />yeah.. they can. and yeah they do. It sucks, it&#039;s not fair, and so what? Deal with it as a real possibility.
