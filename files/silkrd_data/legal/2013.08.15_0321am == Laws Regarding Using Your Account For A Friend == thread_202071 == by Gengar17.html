				So I had a friend in another state who wanted some DMT for his group of buddies, so I walked him through putting coin in my account showed him a couple of different offers from different vendors, and ultimately purchased for him on my account.<br /><br /><br />Which got me thinking, if he was caught by LE and my name came up, what kind of trouble would I be in? I&#039;m sure I would be in some kind of trouble, just wondering some specifics and what I could do to deny it.<br /><br /><br />This is all hypothetical, he has since received his package and visited the leopards on Pluto a couple times with his friends.&nbsp; :) Just trying to make use of this new forum section.

				My guess would be conspiracy, if you got caught.<br /><br />I don&#039;t really see why or how either of you would get caught.<br />If for some reason one of his packs got seized and he flipped on you, well.. you gotta ask yourself, is it really worth it? Are you making a profit off of this or just helping a brother out? <br /><br />I like to minimize my risks and not take on anybody else&#039;s.<br /><br />Tip.<br />Keep all convos with said friend encrypted.<br />Just in case.<br />

				I&#039;m making a profit (in coin) on it for services rendered. <br /><br />Yeah, encryption is key. We&#039;ve been safe about it and I don&#039;t think he&#039;d ever speak my name. I know if I didn&#039;t help him out he would be too technologically impaired to do it by himself (would probably just download TOR and not use Tails or any other safety precautions), so it&#039;s justifiable to help him out and keep a little profit&nbsp; 8) <br /><br />Conspiracy makes sense. Is that a big punishable offense?
