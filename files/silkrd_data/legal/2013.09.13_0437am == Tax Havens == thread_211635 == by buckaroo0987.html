				I read a while back that the Swiss are now releasing information on people who were putting their money there to avoid taxes.<br /><br />This seams to be a trend. Lots of countries are starting to cooperate with the US.<br /><br />Are there still countries out there (besides China) that doesn&#039;t give up the names of business owners or account holders?

				Lots of places.. Where are you cleaning money for / trying to hide money from?<br /><br />SE Asia has many good options, money is easily hidden many ways there, hiding funds is practiced locally by most big fish regardless of where their money comes from. hiding funds has been happening forever in many places in the area, and is not frowned on at all, but is expected as evidence of responsible money management.<br /><br />be ready to pay more than locals for these kinds of services, unless you make a friend.&nbsp; always use caution.<br /><br />I don&#039;t like the places that try to act as a &#039;tax haven&#039; because they seem to be obvious targets for the tax collectors.&nbsp; And they know they have you by the short and curlies regarding your funds.<br /><br />Compare this to a gold weight demoninated savings account with a Kuwaiti bank in Malaysia (clearnet warning) [( http://www.kfh.com.my/kfhmb/v2/contentView.do?contentTypeId=3000&amp;displayPage=%2Fver2%2Fcontent%2Fstandard.jsp&amp;channelPath=%2Fver2%2Fv2_Navigation%2FConsumer+Banking%2FDeposits&amp;programName=04_Gold+Account&amp;tabId=1&amp;cntName=01-GoldAccount-i )] and you&#039;ll see that such an account would be exceedingly unlikely to draw any attention.<br /><br />The games around hiding ownership of a corporation are also alive and well in SE Asia.&nbsp; Go explore for yourself, or message me for details!

				Tax havens are dead if you are an American. International banks don&#039;t want a damn thing to do with Americans anymore and will not open an account for you. Tax havens are really only needed if you are looking at millions of dollars though. Thousands or hundreds of thousands is too small to go through all that bs in my opinion. Just spend it. If you are really set on it I&#039;d probably look into Hong Kong or Dubai.

				FATF blacklist countries and territories don&#039;t necessarily say they will cooperate with the US - the Financial Action Task Force regularly updates their list of Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories.<br /><br />There are levels of blacklisting, as explained by wikipedia like this:<br /><br />June 2013<br />A total of 14 countries were identified as jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies that pose a risk to the international financial system.<br /><br />Jurisdictions subject to a FATF call on its members and other jurisdictions to apply counter-measures to protect the international financial system from the on-going and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks emanating from the jurisdictions<br /><br />&nbsp;* Iran<br />&nbsp;* North Korea<br /><br /><br />Jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan developed with the FATF to address the deficiencies. The FATF calls on its members to consider the risks arising from the deficiencies associated with each jurisdiction<br /><br />&nbsp;*&nbsp; Ecuador<br />&nbsp;* Ethiopia<br />&nbsp;* Indonesia<br />&nbsp;* Kenya<br />&nbsp;* Myanmar<br />&nbsp;* Pakistan<br />&nbsp;* São Tomé and Príncipe<br />&nbsp;* Syria<br />&nbsp;* Tanzania<br />&nbsp;* Turkey<br />&nbsp;* Vietnam<br />&nbsp;* Yemen<br /><br />And 2012 list:<br /><br />Counter-measures apply to these countries: high-risk and non-cooperative<br />&nbsp;* Iran<br />&nbsp;* North Korea<br /><br />Countries not committed to an action plan: high-risk and non-cooperative<br />&nbsp;* Bolivia<br />&nbsp;* Cuba<br />&nbsp;* Ethiopia<br />&nbsp;* Ghana<br />&nbsp;* Indonesia<br />&nbsp;* Kenya<br />&nbsp;* Myanmar<br />&nbsp;* Nigeria<br />&nbsp;* São Tomé and Príncipe<br />&nbsp;* Sri Lanka<br />&nbsp;* Syria<br />&nbsp;* Tanzania<br />&nbsp;* Thailand<br />&nbsp;* Turkey<br /><br />Then the &#039;we are trying, but...&#039; lists, updated in 2012 as well:<br /><br />Countries committed and addressing AML/CFT deficiencies<br />&nbsp;* Algeria<br />&nbsp;* Angola<br />&nbsp;* Antigua and Barbuda<br />&nbsp;* Argentina<br />&nbsp;* Bangladesh<br />&nbsp;* Brunei Darussalam<br />&nbsp;* Cambodia<br />&nbsp;* Kyrgyzstan<br />&nbsp;* Mongolia<br />&nbsp;* Morocco<br />&nbsp;* Namibia<br />&nbsp;* Nepal<br />&nbsp;* Nicaragua<br />&nbsp;* Sudan<br />&nbsp;* Tajikistan<br />&nbsp;* Trinidad and Tobago<br />&nbsp;* Turkmenistan<br />&nbsp;* Venezuela<br />&nbsp;* Zimbabwe<br /><br />Countries committed, but not making sufficient progress<br />&nbsp;* Ecuador<br />&nbsp;* Philippines<br />&nbsp;* Vietnam<br />&nbsp;* Yemen<br /><br />Problem is, if you don&#039;t have some kind of protection or willingness to pay the majority of your funds to some corrupt official, your money won&#039;t be taken by the USA tax man, the local authorities will see to that ... So, tread lightly

The only person I can see here doing this is DPR and Co, but I am guessing that is still too little money. Most of y&#039;all should not worry about this unless you have a business the size of Microsoft or have the money of Bin Laden but are wanted anyway, concentrate first how to be as legal as possible in your place of residence then maybe consider the next level up options. They are costly, nothing is cheap and most of all nothing is a walk in the park. <br /><br />In conclusion to end this...before anyone needs to the money achieve this kind of things, they need some good brains to begin the journey....<br /><br /><br />Meerkovo

				God you people are really messing with danger here. Tax ignorance plus a totalitarian government usually makes a perfect combo for a long prison sentence.<br /><br />The best piece of advice so far is the last: bank secrecy in Belize. It&#039;s pretty much bulletproof. It&#039;s judgement proof and creditor proof. The US government can&#039;t grab your assets over there- unless they first have a conviction of money laundering, murder, drug distribution or terrorism. And they have to provide proof that the account in question belongs to you. The only problem with this is see what happens when you try to get your money OUT of Belize. The second it comes back to America or most western countries the receiving bank will flag it and then the government will see it and track it. They will then RICO (or equivalent seizure) your funds at worst or hit you with reverse onus tax penalties. HEAVY bankrupting penalties. See Dolce e Gabbana.<br /><br />As for the rest of the advice in this thread it&#039;s clueless, dangerous or some mix of the two. No offense. If you do business with any of the criminal/terrorist thug governments on the FATF blacklist then you pretty much deserve what you get. What will you get? Ever seen the movie Blow? Yeah. That.<br /><br />What&#039;s the answer then? Without going into specifics you have to setup a proper offshore structure which is in full compliance with the law. This contains a minimum of 3 components all in separate jurisdictions. You can&#039;t setup the structure directly because if your name is on it then income received by the structure qualifies as worldwide income and is fully reportable and taxable. If you want to know how Apple and other companies and very wealthy individuals avoid paying billions in taxes yearly this is it. It&#039;s actually not that expensive but has to be done correctly or you&#039;re basically signing your own financial death warrant. Of course the totalitarian FATCA which comes into effect in a few months throws a monkey wrench into any American&#039;s tax avoidance plans. Most offshore institutions are currently turning away all American clients because of the incoming rules. All the more of a reason to make sure your structure is setup indirectly and properly by a non-US party.<br /><br />Anyway I won&#039;t name the jurisdictions in question (hint: they&#039;re not fucking communist countries and aren&#039;t in Africa or central Asia!!) and I won&#039;t launder money for anyone here. If I don&#039;t know and trust you IRL then forget it. Way too much risk and it&#039;s nearly impossible to establish trust on either side. Just rest assured it CAN be done in compliance with the law and that&#039;s what the richest people on earth use to skirt around their local tax laws. I can only hope that DPR uses one.<br /><br />My advice? Use the Bitcoin-Qt client and local cash and carry. You get instant secrecy and anonymity when running it over Tor and meeting up face to face with trusted traders. A lot safer than dealing with bankers who are all subject to KYC requirements. Only if you&#039;re dealing with over $100K (preferably over $1M) should you be looking at setting up the type of offshore structure I was talking about.<br /><br />Trust me. You&#039;ve been warned.

				Sir:<br /><br />Please clarify what advice you believe Pinnacle Goods provided that was clueless, dangerous, or some mix of the two?<br /><br />Details on FATF blacklist countries were provided in response to the previous post which stated that &quot;every company says they cooperate with the US&quot;, to expand upon that answer and paint the entire picture.&nbsp; We never advised anyone to do business with any entity from a FATF blacklist country.<br /><br />We stated:<br /><br />&quot;if you don&#039;t have some kind of protection or willingness to pay the majority of your funds to some corrupt official, your money won&#039;t be taken by the USA tax man, the local authorities will see to that ...&quot;<br /><br />Simply put, this statement was a warning about being extorted in these countries, and not having to worry about money being taken by the USA tax man because the local authorities will have already taken it...<br /><br />Hiding money in SE Asia is very commonly practiced by all types of people with every possible level of financial resources at their disposal.&nbsp; From mainland Chinese hiding money abroad, to Japanese businesses, to the locals, hiding money in SE Asia has been going on for a long time and if you find a good partner it can represent a good value proposition.&nbsp; Barriers to entry can be very low.&nbsp; We offer no specifics, or advice, other than to &#039;tread lightly&#039;.<br /><br /><br />Agreed that setting up a structure that is in full compliance with local laws is always advisable, and we would not hold our money any other way.&nbsp; But laws are regularly stretched to extremes in some jurisdictions which are not on FATF blacklists or otherwise notable or suspicious.&nbsp; So using such a structure that is in full compliance with local laws might be frowned upon by IRS and other USA agencies, should they ever investigate said structure, which they won&#039;t if you&#039;re not a total moron about it.<br /><br />Partnering with foreign bankers by working with foreign banks and then poaching some of their top talent, which is easily done in many jurisdictions as many foreign banks pay these highly skilled and invaluable individuals a pittance for their services, opens the floodgates of possibilities for storing and growing funds in their jurisdictions with said local bankers as partners.&nbsp; Establish a few such relationships in different jurisdictions to diversify the risks some fraction of total funds are subject to. Keep these operations totally isolated so no one working on operations in country X are even aware that you have any business interests in country Y is a common sense safety precaution that any novice would identify as a good strategy.<br /><br />&quot;Ali Baba&quot; arrangements &lt;clearnet warning http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Baba_(Malaysia) &gt; are in place all over Malaysia and Indonesia to allow a company to derive benefits reserved for bumiputera when the company is not a bumiputera run business at its core.<br /><br />Thailand property and wealth holding arrangements are easily constructed for nearly anyone, provided they are willing to pay the requisite tea money, and such arrangements are used at very large scale by many governments of Arab nations to guarantee access to reasonably priced rice to feed their citizens: &lt; clearnet warning: http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Rice-associations-farmers-call-for-urgent-review-o-30187778.html &gt; &quot;Many foreign investors from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Singapore now allegedly own rice plantation areas in the North and Central regions to benefit from the current high subsidy prices.&quot;<br /><br />Philippines.. So many possibilities, from providing foreign remittance services integrated with low interest short term loan opportunities, to partnering with Jeepney operators so they have any funds needed to keep their operations functioning smoothly, to providing discount phone home solutions for Filipinos working abroad, assisting the western (or Chinese, Korean, Japanese, or Arab) suitors of Filipinos who were married in obtaining a marriage annulment, helping Filipinos get safe abortions in other countries due to the illegality of abortion in Philippines, to a number of reliable seasonal plays, really the sky is the limit.<br /><br />Opportunities abound in Hong Kong and mainland China.<br /><br />Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, I don&#039;t touch.&nbsp; Cambodia and Vietnam maybe sometime soon. Laos.. Why?<br /><br />A few hundred thousand USD can easily be used to construct one or more legitimate and high yielding business arrangements as described in any of the countries mentioned above.&nbsp; Pay the right people when appropriate and you won&#039;t go to prison.&nbsp; Laws are just suggestions in most of these places.&nbsp; Get good representation and partners, and make sure they live high on the hog, and no problems will ensue.<br /><br />Of course, there&#039;s the &#039;pay the lawyers to structure things like Fortune 500 companies do&#039; option, which you seem to be fond of. But this seems overpriced and more risky than necessary due to an impending day of reckoning that will eventually come to those using such a strategy if they aren&#039;t as rich as Carlos Slim Helou.&nbsp; I hear Netherlands Antilles are good for &#039;be like a Fortune 500 company&#039; structures, as many tax advisers have tried to direct me there.<br /><br />We are aware and have used a number of advanced techniques for moving money, having built and operated arbitrage engines that yielded quite nice returns. Using a wealth of market data to identify patterns in forex futures allowed us to execute trades as though we were frontunning all the options players, which we technically did not do because they were never our clients, and frontrunning one&#039;s own clients is illegal and immoral.&nbsp; More basic transactions utilizing this arbitrage engine ranged from identifying predictable seasonal changes in certain exchange rates, and positioning ourselves to take advantage of these patterns, to identifying circumstances when risk associated with taking large, far out of the money positions was negated by the effects of other factors at play in these markets which were not being priced in.<br /><br />Further, through our operation of an online gambling site we found quite a few opportunities for nearly 90% returns to turn questionable money into gambling winnings, which are not taxed for Australians - so there&#039;s a nice option for any Aussies out there, message me for details on how to get optimal returns with minimal risk.<br /><br />Bottom line: please, Baraka, tell me what is &#039;clueless, dangerous, or some mix of the two&#039; in these suggestions?&nbsp; Do you have experience on the ground in any of these countries?

I didn&#039;t mean to insult. To answer your question I have experience with SE Asia in particular. I think your advice is pretty good actually and I&#039;m sorry to have lumped you in with putting money in Uruguay, etc. But the fact remains that some of these countries are very difficult to move money out of. Take Vietnam for example. Capital controls up the ass. You have to hold your money in Dong and put up with their 10-20% inflation rate. The banks will give you shit for trying to convert any of your money to even a few hundred bucks. All of their gold exchanges have been shut down by the government. Binh Duong may be good for setting up a local biz but you still have to deal with all that other shit. Cambodia and Laos are still very behind but if you know one of the ruling elite over there (only a few families control their wealth) then you&#039;re set. MUCH easier said than done of course. Same thing in Thailand and Indonesia although they&#039;re much further along. Singapore is great but is a police state as many on here have said. They still have very good bank secrecy and were slapped a few years ago by the OECD for being non-compliant with KYC regs. There&#039;s a reason why some of the richest people in the world are domiciled there and why Eduardo Saverin renounced his citizenship to do that. Extremely expensive to live there but you don&#039;t ever have to if that&#039;s just part of your offshore strategy.<br /><br />Your advice about holding gold in Malaysia is good but the quality is subpar for bullion (only 99.5% purity?) and they don&#039;t say what they charge which could be substantial at several % a year. And again you have to ask yourself how you&#039;ll ever get the money back to America or wherever. In most cases you won&#039;t be able to without arousing KYC banking suspicion. HK is a bit better in this respect but incoming funds from any country will arouse suspicion if the amount and frequency are &quot;unusual&quot;<br /><br />You can maneuver your way financially through SE Asia if you know the right people. That&#039;s a big fucking IF though. I have personally been screwed on the ground over there. I would much rather deal with TRUSTED, established and competent businessmen in the west and pay up for that valuable service than take a chance in God knows where. You don&#039;t have to move your money around and can obey the law with respect to taxes which is how they nail a lot of people if they don&#039;t outright seize their funds first. Creating a proper structure and maintaining it is not very expensive if you have at least $100K accumulated. With $1M or more then the cost is very low as a % of your capital.<br /><br />Anyway I still recommend bitcoin above all else for lesser amounts. Much easier, far less headaches and miniscule risk. I&#039;ve only heard of one sub-$1000 bitcoin seizure so far despite the more than $1 billion market cap of the currency. It&#039;s almost impossible to prove anything in court unlike with offshore money transfers which are designed to be tracked by big brother.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Thailand property and wealth holding arrangements are easily constructed for nearly anyone, provided they are willing to pay the requisite tea money, and such arrangements are used at very large scale by many governments of Arab nations to guarantee access to reasonably priced rice to feed their citizens: &lt; clearnet warning: http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Rice-associations-farmers-call-for-urgent-review-o-30187778.html &gt; &quot;Many foreign investors from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Singapore now allegedly own rice plantation areas in the North and Central regions to benefit from the current high subsidy prices.&quot;</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />This is great stuff.

Tax ignorance plus a totalitarian government usually makes a perfect combo for a long prison sentence.<br /><br />The best piece of advice so far is the last: bank secrecy in Belize. It&#039;s pretty much bulletproof. It&#039;s judgement proof and creditor proof. The US government can&#039;t grab your assets over there- unless they first have a conviction of money laundering, murder, drug distribution or terrorism. And they have to provide proof that the account in question belongs to you. The only problem with this is see what happens when you try to get your money OUT of Belize. The second it comes back to America or most western countries the receiving bank will flag it and then the government will see it and track it. They will then RICO (or equivalent seizure) your funds at worst or hit you with reverse onus tax penalties. HEAVY bankrupting penalties. See Dolce e Gabbana.<br /><br />As for the rest of the advice in this thread it&#039;s clueless, dangerous or some mix of the two. No offense. If you do business with any of the criminal/terrorist thug governments on the FATF blacklist then you pretty much deserve what you get. What will you get? Ever seen the movie Blow? Yeah. That.<br /><br />What&#039;s the answer then? Without going into specifics you have to setup a proper offshore structure which is in full compliance with the law. This contains a minimum of 3 components all in separate jurisdictions. You can&#039;t setup the structure directly because if your name is on it then income received by the structure qualifies as worldwide income and is fully reportable and taxable. If you want to know how Apple and other companies and very wealthy individuals avoid paying billions in taxes yearly this is it. It&#039;s actually not that expensive but has to be done correctly or you&#039;re basically signing your own financial death warrant. Of course the totalitarian FATCA which comes into effect in a few months throws a monkey wrench into any American&#039;s tax avoidance plans. Most offshore institutions are currently turning away all American clients because of the incoming rules. All the more of a reason to make sure your structure is setup indirectly and properly by a non-US party.<br /><br />Anyway I won&#039;t name the jurisdictions in question (hint: they&#039;re not fucking communist countries and aren&#039;t in Africa or central Asia!!) and I won&#039;t launder money for anyone here. If I don&#039;t know and trust you IRL then forget it. Way too much risk and it&#039;s nearly impossible to establish trust on either side. Just rest assured it CAN be done in compliance with the law and that&#039;s what the richest people on earth use to skirt around their local tax laws. I can only hope that DPR uses one.<br /><br />My advice? Use the Bitcoin-Qt client and local cash and carry. You get instant secrecy and anonymity when running it over Tor and meeting up face to face with trusted traders. A lot safer than dealing with bankers who are all subject to KYC requirements. Only if you&#039;re dealing with over $100K (preferably over $1M) should you be looking at setting up the type of offshore structure I was talking about.<br /><br />Trust me. You&#039;ve been warned.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><br />Talk about ignorance. Belize is the LAST place I would ever invest money. They have &quot;secrecy&quot;, but they have so many backroom deals with the USA that it&#039;s not even funny. They require documentation for every transaction.<br /><br /><br />If you really want good financial security, and you&#039;re an American, you need to be looking at setting up a residency in another country and going that way to get a bank account. There are double taxation treaties set up, so that as long as your money is on the books in Country A, you cannot be taxed in the USA. <br /><br />With Obamacare rolling out, we need to take extra provisions to hide our money. I recommend all Americans buy precious metals (Gold, Silver) and guns and ammunition :)

The point is what the banks do with their customers&#039; money and whether they respect secrecy or not. In the right jurisdictions such as Belize bank secrecy is taken very seriously. The government can&#039;t force a bank to do anything over there unless there is a conviction for one of those 4 things I named earlier. You&#039;ll read tons of stories about people (mostly very rich, badly advised idiots) who were busted with secret bank accounts in Switzerland. Some in Liechtenstein too (due to a suspected spy who sold out one of their biggest banks a few years back). But have you ever heard of something like that happening in Belize?

But how can anyone seize your money if your name is not found anywhere near your account? That&#039;s what properly structured holdings offer you. Belize would be only one of the jurisdictions used in your structure.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If you really want good financial security, and you&#039;re an American, you need to be looking at setting up a residency in another country and going that way to get a bank account. There are double taxation treaties set up, so that as long as your money is on the books in Country A, you cannot be taxed in the USA. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Bermuda is on treaty with the US. Does that mean you move there which is one of the most expensive places in the world to live?<br /><br />Another problem is the IRS reporting requirements. Unless you renounce your citizenship you have to report ownership of every offshore account you have. Even indirectly. Failure to do so can lead to a criminal investigation, arrest and jail time. Even if you have nothing in the account in question. So everything you said is either moot or undoable for pretty much everyone on here.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">With Obamacare rolling out, we need to take extra provisions to hide our money.
