				Ok here we go. I&#039;m gonna get alot of attacks for this probably but I don&#039;t care anymore! If I get haters that means something is being done right! :) This was originally going to be posted in the thread &quot;How to handle police&quot; But I went a bit overboard.. and I&#039;m too lazy to modify it at this point.<br /><br /><br />I&#039;ll start with some of the prior posts and then go into what I know personally. Stating &quot;no comment&quot; shows acceptance or &quot;tacit acquiesence&quot;. All presumptions under law must be rebutted! All claims against your &quot;person&quot; (CHRISTIAN NAME) can be met with a counter-claim, this is a MAXIM OF LAW, which supercedes statutes and codes. (WHICH ARE NOT LAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) They have the power and force of law because they are accepted by the general population because they don&#039;t know any damned better. Thanks to the programming of the &quot;public fool system&quot;. Yes these &quot;law enforcement officers&quot; who took an oath as PEACE OFFICERS are trying to &quot;charge&quot; you under commerce. THIS IS WHY THEY ALL CARRY BUSINESS CARDS!! Ask any cop for one! They are &quot;re-presenting&quot; an agency which is a fiction non-profit corporation just the same as the courts! All the money they gather goes to the GAO(general accounting office) of each individual state and these funds go offshore to the slave colony owners. I won&#039;t go into further detail in that direction at this time. If you don&#039;t believe me you don&#039;t have to, I couldn&#039;t care less. Fact is DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH DON&#039;T BELIEVE ANYTHING YOU HAVEN&#039;T CONFIRMED PERSONALLY!! Otherwise you&#039;re just spouting crap you &quot;heard&quot;.<br /><br />LEO&#039;s posing as Peace officers are nothing more than NWO security guards in my mind at this point. Yes they are to be taken seriously because as someone already stated they can and do harm quite often with no warrant/probable cause. We as a society of slaves (fear driven) have let this get entirely out of control!!! They only know what YOU tell them. Watch &quot;First 48&quot; and observe the cops taking bets on if the investigator can get them to confess. Without this confession the cops have generally nothing to present to the DA/prosecutor and they basically laugh at the cop and say get out of here with that weak case and bring me something real!<br /><br />Generally as most people don&#039;t have the interest in law, but it should be a standard education for any man/woman to be able to handle their business and not transfer their eternal rights bestowed upon them by god/superior entity/cosmos to a BAR member attorney. (The King James Bible used to be a law text before the corruption of Corpus Juris Secundum and the BAR association) The prosecutor/DA, you&#039;re Attorney, and the Judge are all members of the same club people(BAR). WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br /><br />Most people should simply stick to Power to Charm&#039;s post:<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t wish to answer any questions.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don&#039;t consent to any searches.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Officer, am I free to go?&quot;<br /><br />(Repeat...)<br /><br /><br />You are always free to go because anything other actions by them constitute &quot;False imprisonment&quot; which basically you&#039;re not willing to sit around and stand for their questioning/harassment. You are asserting your right to contract and NOT contracting with these business people posing as Law Enforcement! False imprisonment happens anytime you are held against your will! This equates to kidnapping... If they keep you there against your will and state this in the form of a question (Am I being detained against my will?) it is a CRIME IN PROGRESS by LEO&#039;s by violating your rights which can never be taken away!! (But you can trasnfer them ;) ***Power of attorney**cough**cough***<br /><br />If you are confident about your situation and have done your research there is nothing to fear by talking to police, it&#039;s a good way to get counter-intelligence if you know what you&#039;re doing. Always ask for the warrant, they probably don&#039;t have one. And even if they do you need to see the ORIGINAL WET INK SIGNATURE, otherwise its merely a copy/facsimile/fraud. But generally people are NOT confident and have no clue what they are doing so generally speaking NEVER TALK TO THE POLICE AND DEMAND YOU CONTACT YOUR ATTORNEY IMMEDIATELY!! And don&#039;t fall for the scam of the public defender(public pretender) scam this is merely a way for the court to gain JURISDICTION over your person. Without granting JURISDICTION the court CANNOT proceed! I have seen many judges FLIP OUT on people for coming into court without an attorney. There&#039;s a reason for this, their little secret.. JURISDICTION!!! Please research what this word means because it is BEYOND CRITICAL!!<br /><br />I can go on for days about this subject. So let&#039;s keep this discussion rolling. I am merely a student not an expert, however I welcome any questions. More than willing to help people see past the veil of the matrix!<br /><br />***I am not an attorney, this is not legal advice but merely THEORY. Handle your own business people! READ READ READ!!!! And watch videos :)***<br /><br />p.s. This is just a general mind dump which covered various topics, with no structure and I did not seek to cover any specific topic.<br /><br />

And are required to identify(make the same as) themselves as said representative agent. Not a bit of it is bullshit, you are obviously sadly confused. You may opt out of any given society as you can opt out of any given thing period. I don&#039;t know why you&#039;re touting &quot;global society&quot; on a grand scale of pollution and war the collective isn&#039;t going on sustainably so something has to and will change. We should always act accordingly as you stated. It is NOT your land, you don&#039;t own it and you don&#039;t even have the deed or original certificate thereof. YOU DO NOT HAVE ALLODIAL TITLE TO YOUR PROPERTY or do you? :) There is split title in all property sir, there&#039;s a huge difference between equitable title and a beneficiary which almost all of us are simply beneficiaries of property that was seized long ago. Great example, does anyone have stock certificates anymore? Hell no! They&#039;re held in the Depository Trust Corporation or DTC as all the titles to your other property is. And your government IS one big imaginary line. Lots of them actually. There&#039;s no state or country line when you pass borders sir, at least not yet or the last time I checked. Fences maybe, but the lines on a globe simply DONT EXIST. You need to understand the definition of government firstly. <br /><br />Govern = To control&nbsp; (like on an engine governer controls rpms, or a state governer controls actions of said state.<br />Ment = Of or having to do with the mind (mentor, mental, mente, etc)<br /><br />What does that come to exactly? <br /><br />Looks like its working on you friend ;(<br /><br />If you have a driver&#039;s license, or a birth certificate, or a SSN/SIN/etc card, then you have put your hand to paper and signed that you are part of your respective society.<br /><br />***So you signed your birth certificate? I know you signed &quot;your&quot; social security card. That&#039;s obvious! How about turning it over and reading it for a change!! It states very clearly that you MUST return it on DEMAND!! Is this REALLY YOURS?? Why must you surrender something that belongs to you on demand if its truly yours???????<br />You do not need a drivers license to drive, as you ALREADY know I&#039;m sure we all have a &quot;Right to travel&quot; ordained by god/universe/creator/superior being. This is merely to IDENTIFY you as a NAME, which you cannot be! A name is a word sound, people have MANY names they answer to in life. Nicknames, pet names, stage names. We move in and out of these names as we see fit in our lives. Funny how the court must address a particular name and must get you to address that yes you are indeed said NAME. As you know already said NAME is merely a corporation created with the application for a birth certificate by your parents. This is why said drivers license and social security card have CAPITOL LETTERS (capitus dominutio maximus) which denotes a CORPORATION. YOU MUST BE &quot;IDENTIFIED&quot;(made same as) THIS CORPORATE ENTITY FIRST IN ORDER TO HAVE CHARGES LEVIED AGAINST SAID CORPORATION. If you do not pay said charges in some fashion your body will be held as surety! If only people would wake up dammit... this is the MATRIX in and of itself and this guy is a perfect example of a confused yet somewhat educated debt slave!<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=197321.msg1419564#msg1419564">Quote from: thereisnospoon on August 06, 2013, 07:35 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_alternate_quote">LEO&#039;s posing as Peace officers are nothing more than NWO security guards in my mind at this point.

He is not a &quot;child of the province&quot; as he puts it. And he&#039;s had so much success in court he&#039;s banned from their corporate premises! ;)&nbsp; But anyone can obviously say it&#039;s not real, people can believe what they want. It&#039;s their matrix experience to do what they like with it! So long as they do no intentional harm and hold their word obviously. <br /><br />Beyond that Canada is property of the British Crown. Look at your money.. The queen is on a $20 I have I&#039;m quite sure. And if you look closely on the coat of arms the &quot;Crown&quot; is above it all. But of course that&#039;s all just an ACCIDENT. <br /><br />I&#039;m not sure how exactly things are in Canada, I do know it varies from region to region. I would seek local guidance in matters of sovereignty such as Menard, Dean Clifford for primers and there are many others. The cops are slightly less militaristic than the United States so you guys are way better off in these matters because its slightly less dangerous to actually assert your rights. <br /><br />These matters take an immense commitment of time to re-learn what we&#039;ve been taught. In most cases generally things are opposite of what we were taught.<br /><br />Remember that there are two primary types of Jurisdiction. Personam jurisdiction, which is over your &quot;person&quot; or &quot;corporate name&quot;. And subject matter jurisdiction, which is simply the matter at hand such as any given contract. Hiring an attorney automatically grants personam jurisdiction because the attorney is a BAR member just the same as a Judge. At least this is how it is in the United States. <br /><br />I can say these practices are not imaginary. They are accepted in many regions and are part of a much larger system than your locality. It takes much time to understand the inner-workings of this system and it is not for the timid. Good luck in your studies if you so choose! :)

				I was high during original post but I assure you all info is spot on regardless of the haters I knew I would attract. <br /><br />Simply put everyone can handle their legal needs differently and will do so. If there is no need to go to court then<br />it should be simply avoided at all costs. There are ways to get things done with the correct attorney/judge combo.<br />And there are ways to handle your business in the private as a sovereign. If you don&#039;t believe me but are still interested<br />then simply dig very deep and I promise you will eventually find &quot;remedy&quot;. This does NOT come easy, you must <br />spend a massive amount of study time to pull these matters off and there are months if not years of clearing the <br />crud out of your mind from all of the brainwashing we are put through(USA).<br /><br />Very simply put sovereign = authority. I&#039;m quite sure we are all the &quot;author&quot; of our story. So innately we are all sovereign<br />until we CHOOSE otherwise. Most choose the path of self-induced slavery simply because they know of no alternative.<br />And no this does not require you to live on a mountain-side with no electricity. But you could! :)<br /><br />
