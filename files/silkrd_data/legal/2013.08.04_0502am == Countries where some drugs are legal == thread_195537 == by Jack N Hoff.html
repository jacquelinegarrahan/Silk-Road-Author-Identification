				Mexico - Small personal amounts of cannabis, lsd, heroin and cocaine.<br /><br /><br />I don&#039;t feel like looking anything up right now.&nbsp; Please name more countries with the drugs that are legal within them and cite your sources so that I can add the information to this list. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I really just felt the need to create a topic on the new board. :D

				It&#039;s a long time since I have been to Switzerland, but I believe cannabis cultivation and sale was quasi-legal there. Wikipedia says it ain&#039;t so any more (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_in_Switzerland), but it is definitely still a country that mostly tolerates cannabis use.<br /><br />And there are zones where heroin users can use in public - &#039;injection rooms&#039; where they could get clean needles and access to health services etc. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction#Heroin_maintenance_programmes)<br /><br />

If you get caught with personal use drugs you can still have them seized from you, and you can still be taken to court. If the Judge at court determines you are an addict they can sentence you to drug treatment, otherwise they can give you a small fine, or they can just let you off. So it isn&#039;t really like drugs are decriminalized in Portugal it is just that for personal use amounts of anything the worst sentence you can get is outpatient drug treatment and a small fine.

				Pretty much all posts in this thread are wrong.<br /><br />&quot;LSD is controlled in Mexico, however a law passed in 2009 made personal possession of 15 micrograms of LSD (.015 mg) not a crime&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not a crime&quot; DOES NOT equal LEGAL. Not in a million years and saying that in dumb and dangerous &quot;But officer Jack N Hoff said it&#039;s totally legal? Why can&#039;t I have it?&quot;. It&#039;s not a crime but it is a misdemeanor. <br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195537.msg1410188#msg1410188">Quote from: kmfkewm on August 04, 2013, 08:05 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Czech Republic has similar laws, personal use amounts of all drugs are completely legal, you cannot even get a ticket for them or have them seized from you. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Why are you lying to us kmfkewn? ;) This is obviously bullshit and I expected more from you.<br /><br />Possession of &quot;small amounts&quot; of certain drugs is decriminalized in Czech Republic. It is still a misdemeanor and of course they can be seized and of course you can get a ticket.<br /><br />http://portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/download?idBiblio=69981&amp;nr=467~2F2009~20Sb.&amp;ft=pdf&nbsp; <br />(page 13 for the amounts)<br /><br />Drugs are NOT legal in Uruguay either. I would love to see you convince the local police about that. They would love it too. LOL.<br /><br />Decriminalization is a pop term, legalization is a pop term and both (as such) are worth shit.<br /><br />When using the two terms you need to define what action (not substance) is legal (or decriminalized). Decriminalization of usage, decriminalization of possession, etc.

Many other countries have followed suit such as the UK, Portugal, Spain, Canada to name a few. Here in Australia we we&#039;re supposed to trial a Heroin prescription program that was to commence in 1996 however the American chief drug czar (who cares what his name was) of the time was sent over here by Bill Clinton to get in the ear of our Government of the time to dictate to us how approach our own country&#039;s drug policies and to also remind us of how much money they would be losing if they provided subsidized Heroin for addicts that have all had other forms of maintenance treatment fail them in the past.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I do believe we are nation that dictate our own policies. The erosion of sovereignty is ever more evident than ever in this country. It&#039;s fucking appalling.

Since 1974, the law establishes no quantity limits, leaving it to the judge’s discretion to determine whether the intent was personal use. Once it is determined by the judge that the amount in possession was meant for personal use, there are no sanctions.[46]<br /><br />In June 2012, the Uruguayan government announced plans to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana in order to fight drug-related crimes. The government also stated that they will ask global leaders to do the same.[47]<br /><br />On July 31, 2013, the Uruguayan House of Representatives approved a bill to legalize the production, distribution, sale, and consumption of marijuana by a vote of 50 to 46. The bill heads next to the Senate, where the left-leaning majority coalition, the Broad Front, holds a comfortable majority and is expected to pass the bill. The bill will then be presented to President José Mujica, also of the Broad Front coalition, who has supported legalization since June 2012. Relating this vote to the 2012 legalization of marijuana by the U.S. states Colorado and Washington, John Walsh, drug policy expert of the Washington Office on Latin America, stated that &quot;Uruguay&#039;s timing is right. Because of last year’s Colorado and Washington State votes to legalize, the U.S. government is in no position to browbeat Uruguay or others who may follow.”[48]<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />

Dutch laws regarding cannabis are extremely complicated.<br /><br />Yes, you can have up to five plants in your home. However this is illegal. If the police finds out, there&#039;s a good chance they will seize them, but up to five plants there will be no prosecution. When you take it to court, there&#039;s a chance you get your plants back because the police should abide the gedoogbeleid (more on this later).<br /><br />Also, you&#039;re not allowed to use a lamp for your plants. Given the small quantity and no-lamp policy, this is impossible to use as a source for coffeeshops. Also, when you&#039;re not a coffeeshop, you can&#039;t legally sell your weed, so it wouldn&#039;t be legal anyways.<br /><br />Weed production is otherwise pretty much illegal, so some people rent a house and fill the attic with plants, lamps and everything. To get the electricity, they hire &quot;a guy&quot; who just.. Well, plugs it in. If they ever got a bill, the power consumption would be way too suspicious.<br /><br />There may be some legitimate weed production for prescription weed, I&#039;m not sure - however, anyone who does that is not allowed to sell to coffeeshops.<br /><br />Then there are the coffeeshops. They can sell weed, but they can&#039;t sell to foreigners. They also can&#039;t buy weed, but politicians figure weed magically *poof* bursts into existence. Fun fact: they are also not allowed to sell alcohol. And the coffeeshops.. Are not legal. We have simply chosen not to enforce the laws on them, we still have to abide to opium law. This is gedoogbeleid, a word that can&#039;t even be translated into English: [clearnet]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedogen[/clearnet].<br /><br />Whether or not you can open a coffeeshop depends on the municipality. Some municipalities close to the border have decided to withdraw the licences from all coffeeshops. If you happen to live there, you&#039;re fucked. I personally think they&#039;re only moving the problem into another area, but who am I to say anything about it.<br /><br />Finally there&#039;s possession. You can&#039;t legally have weed. If the cops wanted to, they could wait outside a coffeeshop and confiscate the goods from every buyer. They don&#039;t, once again, gedoogbeleid.<br /><br />If you&#039;re using softdrugs, you must be 18 or over, otherwise it&#039;s illegal. It can also be illegal in some locations, but at home you&#039;re safe.<br /><br />Smoking weed inside a coffeeshop may or may not be legal depending on circumstances: there is a law against smoking of tobacco in place for most public places. This law is in place only for the personnel, it&#039;s okay for customers to suffocate. So if there is a seperate smoking room in the coffeeshop where no personnel is allowed, you&#039;re good. If your joint has no tobacco in it you&#039;re also good and don&#039;t need a seperate room. The Dutch authorities however have no right to check whether or not there&#039;s tobacco in your joint, so the law is effectively impossible to enforce.<br /><br />So if you&#039;re caught by the cops at home right at the moment you put the last crumb of spacecake into your mouth, they won&#039;t be able to charge you with possesion, won&#039;t be able to confiscate anything and the use is legal, so you&#039;re good.<br /><br />More information in Dutch: http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/drugs/vraag-en-antwoord/ben-ik-strafbaar-als-ik-drugs-bezit-gebruik-produceer-of-verhandel.html<br /><br />Now you understand why the Dutch buy so much paracetamol (tylenol). Our own laws gives us a massive headache.

It is largely gedoogd, but still illegal. (unless you have a prescription, but the same goes for cocaine.. cocaine can be, and is, used in hospitals)<br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=195537.msg1546652#msg1546652">Quote from: Jack N Hoff on September 18, 2013, 01:01 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Selling, growing, possessing and using cannabis is not legal in the Netherlands.&nbsp; Many of these activities are tolerated to some degree.&nbsp; It is not legal though.&nbsp; There is a difference.[/q]<br />Using is legal.

This is a website from the government.<br /><br />Admittedly useless for the opening post though as you&#039;re looking for countries where something is legal..<br /><br />Here&#039;s the wiki for Freetown Christiana: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown_Christiania but officially I doubt it&#039;s really legal.<br /><br />For a fun read, try http://www.cracked.com/article_15821_fun-size-countries-insane-histories-worlds-6-tiniest-nations.html. You may have a shot at legal drug use/manufacturing in some of those.<br /><br />Mostly there are few places where anything is legal. Generally it&#039;s more productive to look into more obscure drugs that have not (yet) been regulated. Think adrafinil, that is metabolized in-vivo to modafinil. And uncontrolled in most countries, although there are hardly any reliable suppliers.<br /><br />Perhaps consider that licktoad.. There&#039;s some toad, if you lick it&#039;s butt, it supposedly is like an LSD-trip. But if you lick the wrong toad, you die, so you have to be sure you have the right kind of toad.. But the toad is legal.

Not sure what other channels of government it has to go through to become law. But Uruguay might have legal cannabis soon

The shops you visited all broke the law when they sold to you.<br /><br />http://nos.nl/op3/artikel/509846-buitenlander-nog-steeds-welkom-in-coffeeshop.html<br /><br />&quot;Two thirds of all coffeeshops still sell to foreigners. Especially coffeeshops north of the rivers do not abide the locals-only criteria that became law 1 januari 2013.&quot;

It isn&#039;t even legal for medical use anywhere in Australia.<br />But South Australia allows possession of small amounts &amp; small plants. <br />It&#039;s illegal, but if you get caught they will take it away and give you a fine, but won&#039;t need to go to court.<br />Makes no sense... Should just be legal.

				In Brasil ayahuasca is legal, and also psylocibes cubensis that grow almost everywhere in the rain season.
