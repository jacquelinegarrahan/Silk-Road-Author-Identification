				Mainly unclaimed income. That&#039;s the whole point of the sellers on the Road trading their cold hard cash for your bitcoins, there&#039;s no paper trail for you. If you&#039;re using online services to sell bitcoins and depositing the cash (or using websites like Coinbase to transfer directly into your bank account) to pay bills, it counts as income that you have to claim. (at least in the US) Get audited by the IRS, have a whole shitton of unclaimed (unexplainable, too) income, get whacked with charges of tax evasion at the very least.<br /><br />Pretty much only use BTC to Cash services and never deposit any of that money into a bank account to avoid any trails.<br /><br />Feel free to correct anything I&#039;ve said if I&#039;m way off base here.<br /><br />edit: just remembered prepaid anonymous debit cards. that&#039;s a good way too.

				I am just worried about selling bitcoins on localbitcoins.com and being charged with a felony for being an unlicensed money transmitter [in the US].&nbsp; &nbsp;Just because tons of people are doing it doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s safe.&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;ll go after the biggest fish, either.&nbsp; They might just start cracking down on random users to send a message, who knows.<br /><br />From http://bitcoinmagazine.com/fincen-bitcoin-users-not-regulated-exchanges-are/<br /><br />&quot;a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter.

				As long as you earn below the quota permitted until you pay a business tax as a company (around 30k dollars or something) then you are safe from the tax man. It is only at this point where you must register as an exchanger under the State. Even with this there is no way for a government to keep track of the amount of sales you do for cash so you can forever stay below this.<br /><br />Legally there is nothing against you from setting up your own profile on localbtc and sell coins for cash on a small scale. No law anywhere to be found and no court cases.

				It does depend on what you make because at a certain point you must declare your income as taxable. I don&#039;t know that the figure is precisely 30k I don&#039;t need to know because I&#039;m not an exchanger but if I was then I find this out. And I would decide if I want to be small scale and avoid declaring my profit as taxable or be ok with paying tax.

				it&#039;s definitely more complicated than a black and white &#039;10k&#039; rule -- they monitor for all kinds of suspicious activity that might be related to tax evasion, laundering, etc..&nbsp; if you&#039;re using a personal account, I think you want to avoid depositing more than like 3k of cash per month -- the reason I say this is because they ask if you expect to deposit more than that in cash per month when you open a personal checking account for example, and the set of questions around that one are all pretty clearly related to suspicious activity flagging.<br /><br />btw -- if you are acting as a business, even if you don&#039;t earn more than 30k, that doesn&#039;t mean you don&#039;t have to register as a business, keep proper accounting, etc..&nbsp; and as a money exchanger, it means paying a a huge sum of money to secure a bond for your business.&nbsp; &nbsp;it&#039;s not like once you hit a certain profit threshold suddenly you become a business.&nbsp; so this logic still doesn&#039;t make sense to me.

				^Say that again help my wife? What do you use your acount for? <br />Registering as a money transmitter with fincen is easy. Certain states have &quot;currency Exchanger&quot; licenses that have much lower requirements than money transmitters. <br />Vermont <br />http://nationwidelicensingsystem.org/slr/PublishedStateDocuments/VT-Check-Cashing-and-Currency-Exchange-Company-New-App-Checklist.pdf<br /><br />Ive been researching this alot the past few weeks but have yet to here from an actual big time btc seller what legal precautions they take.<br />As of yet tho it seems the only people who have been charged are liberty reserve, mt gox and the bitcoin association (which doesnt even trade bitcoins.) Atleast thats all i can find on google.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Most recently, the largest bitcoin exchange to halt trading was Bitfloor, run by Roman Shtylman, who blamed &quot;circumstances outside of our control.&quot; His New York operation had average daily trading volume of about $300,000 (depending on the exchange rate), with U.S. dollar deposits and withdrawals running through a Capital One bank account – which the bank unilaterally closed.&nbsp; &quot;I had very little time to act between receiving the account closure letter and the account being closed,&quot; Shtylman told PaymentsSource.<br /><br />In this case, the regulatory guidance may have had an indirect effect. Bitfloor was registered with Fincen as an MSB but was not licensed as a state money transmitter. Shtylman surmised that Capital One had judged his business to be &quot;not worth the risk.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;<br /><br />http://www.americanbanker.com/bankthink/fincen-regulations-choking-bitcoin-entrepreneurs-1058606-1.html<br /><br />If bitfloor didnt register in a state i think you&#039;ll be fine. 300,000 a day is huge.

				Some banks refuse to handle bitcoins, but not because there is a law against trading bitcoins.<br />There are international laws that protect the freedom of trade.<br /><br />Only retarded country&#039;s like Thailand forbid the bitcoin.<br />Those laws are for the show.<br />In China youtube is still watched and in Iran the TorBrowserBundle is still available and in use.<br /><br />You can make a law quite easy. Forbid to held your breath for more then 5 seconds, but a stupid law like that is hard to maintain.<br /><br />Use tails so there are no traces and keep your coins online on a site like Silkroad&#039;s account.<br /><br />

				This is what FinCEN said: &quot;a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter. In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de – centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.&quot;<br /><br />Regardless of the fact that trading money for bitcoins in and by itself is not illegal (in other words, buying bitcoins from a licensed exchange is NOT illegal) , I&#039;m talking about what it means to act as a money transmitter/exchanger.&nbsp; There are laws around that and they are not specific to bitcoin, and I guess this is something that will vary state by state.&nbsp; I suggest researching what your state DFI has to say about bitcoins if anything.&nbsp; You could call or write them and try to get some clarification I suppose, it wouldn&#039;t hurt.<br /><br />As an analogy to make this clearer, buying and selling pharmaceutical drugs is by itself not illegal -- there is no law that says &#039;Prozac is illegal.&#039; - but you need to have a license to sell it legally.<br />

				well since they cant stop bitcoin its ok to sell coins for BTC profit. if your profit is in fiat then your acting as an exchange. that only applies to BTC.<br />and if your a miner im 99.99% positive you can register and then act as an exchange without a licence or you get one by default not sure i was stoned but took mental notes!
