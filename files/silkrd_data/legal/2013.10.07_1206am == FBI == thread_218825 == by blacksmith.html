				Why is the FBI allowed to sell heroin and other drugs with absolutely NO consequences? What makes you guys so special? You should be locked up just like the people you are trying to get locked up. You broke the same exact law as the other vendors.

				Christian religious fundamentalist ideals have pervaded the U.S. to an extent where many of these anti-drug, moral crusaders are doing their jobs out of some self righteous moral obligation to stop &quot;the bad guys&quot; they think God/Jesus/whomever needs them to succeed in defeating. That is my opinion, and personal experience of most individuals I have encountered in LEO. <br /><br />But, it is very odd when a U.S. president that I have voted for twice, volunteered my time for, and even gave money to his campaign when I had little myself. To now oversee the ENTIRE U.S. gov&#039;t disregard their own laws they claim to hold so sacrosanct, and somehow assume moral authority over the entire world like they can do no wrong; and bad things have to happen by their hand to prevent more, even worse events, i.e. terrorism. Obama not only admits to killing a 16 boy (and American citizen) without due process of law, but seems to be damn proud of it. <br /><br />I am not just pissed about losing my money, I am pissed about being tricked, pushed, and even subjected personally to violence by the hands of the state, whom now unjustly assume that monopoly on violence. We the people need to have a voice that&#039;s heard. No one cares anymore, or they&#039;re too busy trying to scrape by that they don&#039;t have the time to wrap their heads around the oppression that consumes them. That&#039;s where they want us... Occupy Wall Street and some of those splinter groups have/had the right picture of reality for the average. People like us on SR need to stick together to keep on keeping on even if it is just a little fuck you in a sea of bullshit.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
