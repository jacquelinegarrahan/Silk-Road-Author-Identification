				I&#039;m reading that drug dogs can also detect cash.<br /><br />I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s only large amounts, although I can think of a half dozen reasons why a person would legally want to mail cash....<br /><br />So how much is generally acceptable to mail before anyone starts to care? Is it similar to the 10k transaction rule where money over that amount has to be reported?

				For the record I believe there are very few drug dogs for mailing cash, especially domestically.&nbsp; Not sure how much you can mail before it&#039;s considered risky, though.&nbsp; I guess it depends on what you&#039;re getting in return for the cash (or vice versa).

				OK, so you don&#039;t think there are many dogs who can smell cash?<br /><br />Guys, there are clearly people on the SR who send LOTS of money through the mail.<br /><br />As for the IRS caring, I would think as long as it shows up on taxes, they don&#039;t care how the money was physically moved.
