				I ordered ~200 pills, international and it has tracking.<br />I got the usps slip telling me they missed me and that i should stop by to pick it up.<br />with the slip, i also got my order for half an ounce of mushrooms, so i&#039;m skeptical.<br />if this were a controlled delivery, wouldn&#039;t they have also asked for me to sign for the other package or checked my other packages after finding out with pills?<br />should i sign? should i let it go? how should i go about this?<br />I am also expecting an international clearnet package from ebay around now too.

				Are you sure the seller did not make sure the package be dropped off to an individual rather than just left on the doorstep?<br /><br />I would be weary regardless. It can&#039;t be too big of a loss to leave it be, can it? It&#039;s not worth as much as your freedom. But I&#039;d also listen to other people&#039;s advice, I&#039;m no expert.<br /><br />Good luck

				In situations like this, I usually take a step back and wait.<br />See what packages actually show up at your place without signing or having to pick-up.<br />Then I would think about what to do again when I have more information.<br />It can never hurt to wait.<br />Also, clean house, it can never hurt.

				That&#039;s typical proceedure for them when the package requires a signature and you&#039;re not there(or don&#039;t answer the door) to sign.&nbsp; As a rule, if it&#039;s international and has tracking, it requires a signature.

				The cops don&#039;t have enough time on their hands to be sitting inside of the post office for weeks hoping that you will show up to sign for this package.&nbsp; If you weren&#039;t there, I&#039;m pretty sure that they would have surveillance on the house and wait until you were home to do a CD.&nbsp; The search warrants for CDs also don&#039;t last too long, so they wouldn&#039;t be able to follow through with searching your house or anything that day.&nbsp; <br /><br />I say make sure that your house is clean and just go grab it with the mindset that you weren&#039;t expecting anything, but are just going to see because of the note.&nbsp;

				For my first ever order (about 550$ worth, international) from SR, the vendor sent it tracked even though I specifically asked not to. They didn&#039;t even notify me of doing that, so when I got home on the day of the delivery, I was scared shitless when I found the slip. <br /><br />Fuck! What&#039;s this? CD? Are they waiting for me at the PO? What to do? What to do? FUCK!!!<br /><br />So, I contacted the vendor, who said &quot;Don&#039;t to worry, everything will be ok, just go pick it up&quot;. After some other messages, they gave me the tracking number and kinda admitted sending it tracked on purpose. Well, I was a new customer, international, a biggish purchase, demanding escrow and living in a country with tough customs. A risky customer.<br /><br />Anyway, I HTFU&#039;d, walked to the PO, got my package and got home. The dope was there, and I was still a free man. Phew!<br /><br />I&#039;m rambling, but what I mean to say is, you&#039;ll be fine. Go to the PO, and get your pack. You&#039;ll have your pills, and be happy.<br /><br />oh, one thing:<br />In general, I find it more suspicious not to pick up mail addressed to you than to go pick it up. I think everyone would be curious to know what the hell is it that&#039;s waiting them in the PO.

				You should have asked the seller if you are required to sign. Lastly, they usually post that crap in their profile page so be aware of their policies.<br /><br />Good luck &amp; be careful<br /><br />ce<br /><br /><br />
