				I&#039;m curious, could you sell two or more legal precursors at once, without any instruction or suggestion to combine them?&nbsp; Pretty much a make your own RC kit.&nbsp; I&#039;m not sure about the chemistry, but there must be some drug where the final step/steps of synthesis are simple to perform, and the precursors legal.&nbsp;

				I can only state a certain level of experience in witnessing something take place. so take that for what it&#039;s worth.<br /><br />This did not take place in the US. If it had I&#039;m sure everyone involved would be in jail. None the less. A perfectly legal precursor for MANY legal (and some illegal) substances was bought from a whole sale chemical company to a smaller distribution company (think the guys who supply costco as the whole sale and costco as the distributor.) <br />Even though these were legal obtained, legal to own, and in the country this took place not officially on a watch list (they are on a watch list in the US). They were not sold to an individual only to a distribution company. The industrial warehouse (not some chicken shit packing house) was under 24 hr watch and when the driver (fully licensed for chemical transport) arrived to pick them up they were followed by a rotating tail (at least 3 cars possibly 5). The were followed to their destination and the professionally licensed driver was put into cuffs and the goods confiscated. In the end the driver wasn&#039;t taken in or charged. Simply held for an hour. The chemicals were taken and after a fairly lengthy argument from the distribution companies lawyer, were scheduled for release. However the authorities involved made sure to only allow for pick up after the chemicals had passed their expiration date. Aside from that who knows what was done to/with them. So they were simply returned to the wholesale for disposal. <br /><br />on occasion #2 the same happened but then an abort procedure was followed. I won&#039;t get into detail but it follows full legal procedures and does not in any way shape or form violate any law, it also leaves the distribution company free of the chemicals so there is no &quot;holding&quot; issues. Even after this procedure was followed and the driver was free of all chemicals and returned home he was still tailed. The police sat on his residence for 4 days and undoubtedly his name is now on some list in some computer somewhere.<br /><br />There were no repercussions to this as there were no legal issues but that might give you an idea of what mere suspicion can get you even if all the legal channels are followed. It can be done and it was successfully done for a time but once it was on the radar it was under constant watch making it impossible. This also included a large degree of start up, not only for legal fees, business license, incorporation, leasing property for proper storage, inspections prior to opening, leasing a front office, creating all parts of a properly functioning business (including taxes at the year end), employee pay roll, vehicles for transportation. Of course if you&#039;re looking at a small scale situation you won&#039;t have to go through any of that, but you won&#039;t have it as a shield when the law comes knocking, and they will, they always do.<br /><br />

				Depends on the precursor. If it is a list chemical and you do not have a liscense to sell it, you can be charged for selling an illicit/controlled substance just like it was any other drug. Selling precursors will of course be easier to get away with but if they happen to catch you in the act of selling it some how, prepared for any sort of shit storm you would expect from a drug busted.

Kits that contained grape juice and yeast. They called it &quot;grape bread&quot; kits or something.

				Rule number one:<br />First ship a combo of precursors to me in order to play magic.<br /><br />Rule number two: do it the SR way. As far as I know you can not sell anything you&#039;ve bought. For example: a game.<br /><br />And don&#039;t worry too much. This is what the receiving person should do. And that person should act like it was supposed to be shipped to somebody else because that person has absolutely no idea what these compounds are.<br />
