				Title: <strong>Best place for psychedelic therapy ?</strong><br />

				Where in the world are people the most open and the government the least oppressive to begin this practice ? This is for a friend who heas been doing it a few years and is looking for a new location. Colorado ? Netherlands or Denmark? He is in US now so English speaking country would be preferable . Basically a place where law enforcement focus on illegal use of LSD /MDMA is very small and the possibility of being caught would be the smallest .<br /><br />Remember the friend is not selling but just giving&nbsp; one on one therapeutic/personal growth sessions <br />What other legal issues could one face if caught giving a psychedelic ?the patient will be charged for the product so that is an issue.<br /><br />Of course , this is very secretive and structured filtering system and precautions will be put into place to prevent the possibility of being caught . <br />the advice is always appreciated

				Here&#039;s a few that have laxer laws for small-time possession<br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_liberalization#Drug_liberalization_around_the_world<br />From that list we have the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Latin America, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Uruguay.&nbsp; I only offer this as a starting point as I&#039;m not at all informed about individual laws.<br />I don&#039;t know if it legally makes any difference, but perhaps charging for a service and giving away the drugs free would cover your ass a tiny bit.&nbsp; All the best with your mates endeavor
