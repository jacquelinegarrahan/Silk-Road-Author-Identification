				Hey everyone, I&#039;m relatively new here so I apologize in advance if y&#039;all have already been over this, but i was doing some digging and came upon this story [CLEARNET] http://www.ocolly.com/news/crime/article_7d54edea-f3e7-11e1-a886-001a4bcf6878.html<br /><br />So long story short, kid orders a key of m1 to his dorm last year, customs flags it calls his school&#039;s PD, they call him and say he has a package waiting for him at PO, kid goes to get it, they watch him pick it up and nail him. Then they search his dorm and find roids and wire transfers to China. The article basically makes it sound like he&#039;s fucked, facing 15 years on one count, minimum of 10 on the other. But then i did some more digging and found this [CLEARNET] http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/GetCaseInformation.asp?submitted=true&amp;viewtype=caseGeneral&amp;casemasterID=258578&amp;db=Payne<br /><br />Which says that ALL his charges were dismissed. There seems to be no indication why they were dropped or what went on in court. So I&#039;m wondering how is this possible? it seems unlikely that he got off on a technicality right? I mean they literally followed him to the post office and watched him get the package and get in his car. They found wire transfers to China. Steroids in his dorm, and it was all in a school zone. Only thing i can think of is he ratted, but even then, doesn&#039;t it seem odd that they would outright dismiss all charges? <br /><br />What do you guys think?<br /><br />

				Wow he must have really started squealing. It seems to be the case if you turn Narc, they still end up charging you with something...usually something retarded, but something none-the-less, just so you don&#039;t &quot;forget&quot; about them. Either that or the person in question was born with a lucky horseshoe up his arse!

				I&#039;m sure the fact that he was a 19 year old white male attending a university helped him out a bunch too.<br /><br />You guys think he was ordering from SR? i guess the wire transfers indicate that he wasn&#039;t, only thing that made me think he might have been is because he had roids too.

It would seem since the money was wired, the deal was done outside of SR. I have never bought anything near this big but wouldn&#039;t imagine the dealers on here leaving any sort of trail like that. The snitch consensus looks to be the most plausible scenario.

In fact, Customs and Border Protection in San Francisco, California had intercepted 10 pounds of alleged Methylone from China that was addressed to the client’s home address in Tulsa. Customs and Border Protection contacted the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Postal Inspector, and the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office about the 10 pounds of Methylone. The federal and state agencies agreed to cooperate with one and other and they began conducting surveillance on the client. After a period of time, Customs sent the Methylone to Tulsa so it could ultimately be delivered to the client and once he accepted delivery, he could be arrested for Manufacturing a Controlled Drug or Possession of a Controlled Drug With Intent to Distribute. The federal and state agencies obtained a state search warrant for the client’s house and arranged for a controlled delivery of the Methylone. An agent from the office of the U.S. Postal Inspector posed as a FedEx delivery person and delivered the 10 pounds of Methylone to the client’s residence, while Homeland Security, the DEA, and Tulsa County Sheriff’s Deputies waited around the corner. Once the delivery was made, law enforcement stormed the house and executed the search warrant. The federal and state agents seized the 10 pounds of Methylone, 1,500 Xanax pills, a $25,000 pill and capsule manufacturing machine, pill bottles, a pistol, ammunition, $63,000 in cash, scales, credit card machines, computers, iPhones, two automobiles, and numerous other items of evidentiary value. Once inside the house, the agents applied for, and were granted, 5 additional search warrants for the client’s place of business, his storage unit, and his computers. The client was taken into custody and interrogated extensively. During the course of the investigation, the police arrested the client’s mother in an effort to coerce him to cooperate. In order to keep his mother from being charged, the client gave a long and detailed confession to the police. The client was charged with Manufacturing a Controlled Drug, Possession of a Firearm While in Commission of a Felony, Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, and was facing up to life in prison. Mr. Henson got involved in the case immediately after the client posted a bond to get out of jail, and after extensively interviewing the client and his mother, began his own investigation into the case. Mr. Henson discovered serious flaws in the government’s case, and that the initial search warrant was defective. He went to work attacking the proof. Mr. Henson filed a Motion to Suppress the Evidence and Statements in the case. At a suppression hearing, the judge agreed with Mr. Henson that the search warrant was defective and ALL of the evidence in the case was suppressed, including the 10 pounds of Methylone, the 1,500 Xanax pills, and the firearm. Since the original search warrant was defective, the subsequent 5 warrants were also found to be invalid, and the client’s confession was thrown out as well. Without any evidence, the case was dismissed and the client’s property was returned to him!</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I just want to point out as awesome as this is, it is like winning hte lottery.&nbsp; This guy was incredibly lucky that they fucked up the original search warrant.&nbsp; Otherwise he would have been seriously fucked.&nbsp; 99/100 times the search warrant is not going to be fucked up and you will not be able to beat a case like this.&nbsp; <br />It seems rediculous that this guy had almost 5 kilos sent directly to his HOUSE and also kept all that other drugs , cash , manufacturing equipment in his houuse as well.&nbsp; Sounds like the luckiest idiot in the drug game to me, hahaha.&nbsp; <br />And I have know a guy with 80,000 spent on legal counsel and still did years in prison.&nbsp; There was an illegal search done, property was seized at 10pm the search warrant was approved at 2am, the cops testified it was a &quot;paperwork error&quot;, the judge ruled in their favor and said he couldnt beleive these fine officers would dare to lie under oath , and the guy got 48 months.&nbsp; <br />So please dont read this story and think this will happen to you if you get caught importing m1, chances are slim the warrant will be fucked up.&nbsp; Have a SECURE drop, dont get it sent to your home! There is ALWAYS a risk importing drugs!

				I would say you&#039;re right Venport...<br /><br />They even mentioned that the Customs had delayed the order, and waited to set up the CD.&nbsp; The kid probably had some idea that his pack might have been snagged, probably logged on SR Forums and checked the &quot;what to do&quot; list from the top down, and never opened the pack.&nbsp; Just left it by the door &quot;RTS&quot; style, as he was supposed to.&nbsp; They executed the warrant, based on him &#039;accepting&#039; the delivery, but if he did not open the package, then that would be means to call the initial warrant &#039;defective&#039;. :)

A LOT of drugs. That&#039;s a BIG NO NO. Also,&nbsp; when you have it sent to a home address, you do not control when the package get&#039;s delivered. They do. Say a pack got seized, and you didn&#039;t want to get it. Well, in a private residence, they&#039;re GOING to come knock @ your door. In other situations, it would have been a lot easier to let it go or at least let it sit a little. But letting it sit is no substitute and will not protect you if they want you.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />totally agree with you AV! (as always) Any drop you have should be CLEANNNN and the drop shouldn&#039;t be tied to any previous problems....Man this guy got so lucky.

				Cops will do anything and everything to get you to cooperate... and let&#039;s do some math here... in our heads, but together.<br /><br /><br /><br />Let&#039;s say you were the PD who arrested this kid.. and he started singing like a canary.<br />Well, let&#039;s say the scenario is set as: &quot;We have two charges that can lock this kid up for 20-30years..<br />OR.. we can get him to help us arrest 20-40 people who can all server 1-5.. and pay hellacious fines and court costs...&quot; <br /><br />I could be completely wrong... but hey, cops are called pigs for a reason and the government is not our friend for a reason. <br /><br />Friends don&#039;t let friends do steroids!

				The DA can do whatever they want.&nbsp; Maybe they liked the kid.&nbsp; Younger college kids certainly get more sympathy than older non-educated people.

				dont you think the story of how he got off is a coverup so they still have all the people he ratted on to go after, he didnt get lucky he gave enough that they came up with a cover story, judges dont drop search warrents anymore, you have no rights anymore. its a coverup because he gave up enough people and paid enough money
