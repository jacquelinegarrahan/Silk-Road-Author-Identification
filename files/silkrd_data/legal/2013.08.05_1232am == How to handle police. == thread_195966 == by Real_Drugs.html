				I thought it would be an idea to make a thread about handle police before/after arrest. There has been much debate about this and I would like to know what the general consensus is.<br /><br />Personally I am a firm believer in the &quot;no comment&quot;.

				&nbsp; &nbsp;More times then not, &#039;No Comment&#039; is best and acceptable you can give. However sometimes it can work against you in a court of law, especially when they have a mountain of evidence against you. But you need to elaborate more on where and how your trying to handle the police, when you have been driving a motor vehicle, random stop and search in the street? There are different scenarios and sometimes they can play out differently.<br /><br /><br />Meerkovo&nbsp;

				you can be detained for reasonables causes, and throwin in jail for 24 hours. during that time they will degrade you and try to make you crack.

				&quot;Am I being detained or am I free to go.&quot;<br /><br />With that said they either have to arrest you or they have to let you go. I believe the traffic rule is something like a cop cannot hold you for more than 15 minutes unless you are being detained... though most cops won&#039;t know that. If you aren&#039;t being detained(as in they smelled something in your car, etc, or are arresting you) then technically you are free to go. <br /><br />

				I&#039;m also curious how far this &quot;don&#039;t talk to the police&quot; advice should be taken. For example if a cop knocks on my door, but as far as I&#039;m aware they have no reason to suspect me of doing anything, should I just refuse to open it? Couldn&#039;t they just be asking around for information about a crime unrelated to me? I know refusing to open the door to the police by itself shouldn&#039;t be enough for them to get a search warrant, but it may put me more on their radar as a suspicious person. On the other hand they could know more about my activities than I hoped, and be looking to trip me up, but there&#039;s no way to know in advance.

				1. Cops are NOT your friends. Their job revolves around charging people with offences. A granny who crossed on a red light, a young kid who stole 50 cents worth of gum, a uni student who has 1 gram of pot... they are all potential revenue for the cop. The more people the cop busts the better his salary is. Cops are there to serve the government and themselves, not the citizen, never forget that! <br /><br />2. You only need to state your name and address to police. After that it&#039;s NO COMMENT or I would like to maintain my right to be silent! When you confess or talk to the cops, you not only prosecute yourself in the process but you are actually doing the cops&#039; work for them, If confronted by the cops anywhere, ask if you are being detained, if not ask if you can go. If not and they keep wanting to &quot;talk to you&quot; say NO COMMENT and demand your lawyer. <br /><br />3. Be respectful to cops as they can fuck you up, hurt you or even murder you. <br /><br />4. Cops can&#039;t enter your home without a warrant. If you hear cops knock on your door, the best advice is not to even open the door. Pretend no one is home. <br /><br />Watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8z7NC5sgik and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08fZQWjDVKE<br />

We&#039;re still going to rip your car apart anyway. No warrant required, just &#039;suspicion of presence of drugs. I knew a cop once. He told me that if a drivers pissed him off he wouldn&#039;t hit him with some phoney &quot;you ran that red light back there&quot; routine - too much paperwork. He&#039;d spend 30mnins searching his car for drugs instead. <br />

				I think the truth is that you cannot handle police.&nbsp; The best you can hope, is to avoid having police handle you.&nbsp; Be straight, simple, non-combative.&nbsp; And whatever you do do not try anything fancy.<br /><br />The idea that &quot;cops are not your friends&quot; stands as solid advice while also being slightly misguided.&nbsp; Certainly, do not admit anything to police, they are not there to help criminals.&nbsp; But treating a police officer with respect and thoughtful consideration will always get you a lot farther then being combative.<br /><br />Most importantly: The guilty talk in attempts to defend themselves.&nbsp; The innocent stay silent for they have nothing to fear.<br /><br />This all said, it really really depends under what circumstance you are interacting with LE.&nbsp; A car stop vs getting caught with a joint vs having your door busted down are obviously different scenarios.&nbsp; But even so, being combative will get you nowhere fast.

				Remember : They LIE- OFTEN<br />The good cop and bad cop are both in reality dumb and dumberer cop. <br />If they tell you it&#039;s a crime to lie to an investigator, remember quietly to yourself that the 1st amendment states to the contrary.<br />No information you tell them will lessen the charges you face time you spend incarcerated. Even the police dont respect snitches. Keep your mouth shut.<br />Admit to nothing, make tham have to prove it.<br />Do not sign away your rights no matter who in the court system tells you to.<br />The pub defender, DA, and Judge are all incohoots with each other- your attorney is on his own side- only one on your side is you.<br />IF most people wouldn&#039;t sign off their right to a speedy trial, and not accept plea bargains, courts would have to only take on the most serious and legitamate criminal cases.

The justice system is broken, and it&#039;s not changing anytime soon. <br /><br />And all of that doesn&#039;t even touch on situations where innocent people take deals out of fear of being punished for going to trial and losing. <br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was arrested awhile back for petty shit, not at all drug related. The fines were less than a retainer fee(how convenient, right?) so it didn&#039;t make sense to hire a lawyer. I had a buddy of mine advise me since his boss wouldn&#039;t let him take the case pro-bono but otherwise I handled it all. Showing up to my plea hearings, my prelim, etc. I can see why people don&#039;t want to fight crap...I sat in the court room for 2-3hrs EACH time to spend 3 mins in front of the judge saying 4 &quot;Yes your honor&quot; and leaving. Of course, because I didn&#039;t have a lawyer(or one that the prosecutor liked), I went to the bottom of the pile EVERY time. Why couldn&#039;t I go first? The lawyers that are in there rep multiple clients at a time so they were up there for sometimes 30+mins. <br /><br />By the end of the ordeal(about 6 months in total), I was seriously ready for a plea deal. I didn&#039;t even care anymore, I was over the stress of being arrested and was tired of wasting my PTO to sit in the court room for 3 hours. The system is so broken, it&#039;s unreal. Six fucking months for 2 misdemeanors? I could have done the entire thing, start to finish in about 15 mins if I just got the judge and prosecutor alone. The judge was great and I think he really liked the fact I stood up in front of the court myself in response to my own actions. He did speak candidly to me a couple of times which was a nice touch....I think more of that needs to happen. Not everything needs to be defined in a law book and sometimes good people get put in bad situations and LEO overreact(even admitted to me by their superior, yet no dropped charges).<br /><br />Fuck the US Justice system.

				Dont talk and make sure if you are arrested and they say &quot;Do you understand&quot; say NO. That is legal jargon for standing under them, if you accept this then you are agreeing to their authority. A very very important point to remember.

				I would love if at least some of you spoke about hot to handle the police in Europe.<br />Most of the things that you guys said until now , doesn&#039;t work in most of the countries ( maybe i am wrong about this )<br />I know at least the &quot;not speaking&quot; and &quot;not admit anything&quot; works but the other rules don&#039;t apply to Europe , just to US only .

				Like other people have said, there&#039;s gonna be different situations in which you encounter LE but I am assuming you would be concerned more about either being caught in possession of drugs in public, transporting them in your car, or receiving them in the mail - stop and search in person/public order offence, road traffic violation, and possession charge for receiving drugs in the mail.<br /><br />If you are stopped in public or pulled over by traffic cops, in the EU all your obliged to tell LE is name, address and DOB. Provide your driving licence if driving (or you&#039;ll be asked where it is and likely they will try to draw you into conversation about this). <br /><br />Situations vary, but for the most part say fuck all.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don&#039;t panic.<br /><br />Act surprised if you feel it works. <br /><br />Listen to what they are saying to you.&nbsp; It&#039;s ok to ask what powers they are using if you feel the situation merits it - LE often prey on the average person&#039;s lack of knowledge of their civil rights - but you may end up in a conversation.&nbsp; Given their response, and whether their interest would result in you being detained in any way, you should be able to gauge how to play it.<br /><br />Do not consent to any kind of search.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you have to have something in your car, don&#039;t be driving around stoned or under the influence of anything, or give LE any reason to pull you over.&nbsp; Why go to the extent of using SR and then fuck up all the effort you&#039;ve put into remaining anonymous by not taking the same precautions IRL?&nbsp; However if they do, and you are straight, it&#039;ll more than likely be for a traffic offence, so get your paranoia under control and keep your responses to the bare minimum.&nbsp; If you get a ticket, be pissed off like you would any other time, not fucking relieved that you didn&#039;t get searched and basically thanking them for your fine.&nbsp; But you can be pissed off with a scowl and still say fuck all.<br /><br />Don&#039;t let them in your house, but you don&#039;t need to be rude and piss them off either (unless they already have a warrant to enter/arrest, and if they do then you were probably kinda fucked well before they came a-knocking), and if you&#039;re at all concerned they may come back make sure you take immediate steps to have nothing incriminating in your home.&nbsp; There&#039;s a whole lotta threads on plausible deniability in the Security section.<br /><br />And say fuck all.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in EU, article 6 of the ECHR provides the right for people not to incriminate themselves - this is incorporated into the domestic law of every EU country.&nbsp; So in case this might be a right you have to exercise SAY FUCK ALL. We all know criminal charges have higher thresholds for proof so use this to your advantage and call a lawyer.<br /><br />Let your lawyer do the talking - you say fuck all.<br />

				(have not read anything)<br /><br />LE (at least around here) had the lowest education possible.<br />So:<br />1: YOU KNOW ABOUT NOTHING!<br />2: Ask their name etc.<br /><br />If 1 fails, pay people to visit their homes. Or be friends with somebody who&#039;s almost like the hulk so he can beat 5 cops down which will be invalid cops/people the rest of their lives. This does not need to happen. Just the fear is enough.<br /><br />And remember: FEAR is the biggest weapon on earth.
