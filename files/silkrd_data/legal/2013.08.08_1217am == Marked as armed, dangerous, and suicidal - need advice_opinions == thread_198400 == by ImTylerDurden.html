				I wont go into detail of how it happened. And im actually not 100% sure of how it happened.&nbsp; But I know that my profile is marked as armed, dangerous, and suicidal whenever LE runs my lisense/ID/etc. I am also 100% positive that there was no plausible reason for having my profile marked like that. I have never been in a violent or dangerous crime, and I have had 0 suicidal thoughts my entire life.&nbsp; The local cops all know my name and have always been a dick to me. Whenever I get pulled over for a traffic violation, cops are always coming up to my window all anxious with their hand on their gun and shit; even when I&#039;ve gotten pulled over for traffic violations in other states of the country. Is there any way I can get this tag removed from my identity? Would I need to hire a lawyer? SHOULD I actually spend the money to get this taken care of? I live in USA btw. Any opinion/advice from knowledgeable people is appreciated.

				Sadly, a mark on your file like that is extremely hard to do anything about.&nbsp; Your best bet would be to move to a town where the LE don&#039;t know you.&nbsp; Not much other option, sadly.... it&#039;s extremely hard to fight a record that isn&#039;t being used in court.

				Are you 100% certain that it says that about YOU?&nbsp; The reason I emphasize you is while traveling across the US I got pulled over and the cop asked me to get out of my car and go back to his car with him.&nbsp; He tells me to get in the passenger side so I&#039;m sitting shotgun watching him run my stuff on his laptop.&nbsp; He turns to me and says &quot;It says here you have violent tendencies.&quot;&nbsp; I&#039;m in shock.&nbsp; I look surprised and say &quot;that can&#039;t be!&quot;&nbsp; He asks if I&#039;ve ever been arrested or committed a violent crime.&nbsp; I said no and no!&nbsp; Then he says &quot;Oh my mistake that&#039;s Johnathan Thomas not you Johnathan Thompson.&quot;&nbsp; So basically he was just bluffing to feel me out and see if I would admit to something.&nbsp; He wasn&#039;t LOLing about it but he had this sort of smirk on his face.&nbsp; The guy wasn&#039;t a big dick or anything we treated each other cool so I have no idea why he did that.&nbsp; So maybe in your case a cop told you that but it might not actually be true.&nbsp; It might be a technique they use to get you to admit something.&nbsp; <br /><br />P.S.

				First question is why the fuck do you keep getting pulled over? 4 years of driving and the only time I have ever been pulled over was deliberetly speeding 20 miles over the speed limit in a zone that I didnt know the speed. Sounds like you need to be more careful driving, and make sure your tags check out and what not.

I was confused as fuck, and told him I had no idea how that was on there. I explained that I had gotten in trouble with the law previously but none of it was dangerous, violent, or suicidal in anyway. I&#039;m not a convicted felon or anything either.

				That sucks. <br /><br />I can only tell you that it is going to be expensive to remove that. The problem is not only do the cops are assholes -they are also incredibly lazy.<br /><br />You would need a court order and even then -it may not propagate through the system.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a thought: damages. If you can prove that this financially harmed you -then you can sue for damages.<br /><br />I would get a lawyer.<br />

				Actually from anyone who got done for possession of a restricted weapon (gun, taser, knife etc). After the court has dealt with you (fine, community service, etc). Do the cops still pull you over and ask to search your car or on your person? That would really suck if you got done for something like that and cops still kept annoying you after the court has dealt with it. Has anyone had this happen to them? Any chance to wipe it? <br /><br />Imagine driving with your GF or wife and get pulled over for a speeding offence only to have them ask to search your car for past possession of a weapon.

				Cops use scare tactics and other means to intimidate teens and 20 somethings for possible mj possession frequently in some parts of USA, think nothing of the dog other than you being profiled by age.<br /><br />No idea about restricted weapon, sounds like a state level question that might vary a lot.&nbsp; Most places, most charges can be wiped for a reasonable amount with the right attorney.

Would I need to hire a lawyer? SHOULD I actually spend the money to get this taken care of? I live in USA btw. Any opinion/advice from knowledgeable people is appreciated.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Get the details by asking directly. Ask City or Local Police. Ask County Sheriffs or the equivalent if they exist in your location.&nbsp; Same holds for a &#039;state troop&#039; type officers, even if you have had zero interaction with that agency, don&#039;t you think knowing why you get different treatment from them and the others is important.<br /><br />You need to ask a few small questions to a few parties, so I would write the questions out clearly and have them ready to deliver. Call each office&#039;s phone number from somewhere not close to them and where you could get in a car and move to another place where it&#039;s easy to avoid being cornered, if they are acting like they want to meet with you that day. This is assuming you prefer calling them to going to each of their cop shops for an in-person conversation (you prefer this).&nbsp; This is also why you prefer to call in a natural manner when you&#039;re running errands not close to their location at all.&nbsp; You should not need to disclose your location, and until I understood exactly what was going on I would be conservative in approaching this.<br /><br />You shouldn&#039;t need a lawyer if you did nothing wrong.&nbsp; People were getting on &#039;do not fly&#039; lists 5+ years ago when they were longtime employees of blue chip companies, or even S. Service agents (nice former neighbor. he moved off the block later, me off sooner. but dude and his fam didn&#039;t bother me none, they was always super nice, and really respectful. Particularly his respect of privacy and dedication to maintaining good borders between neighbors as appropriate, but that&#039;s cultural here.&nbsp; He was always very busy with his job too.)&nbsp; These people misassigned to the &#039;do not fly&#039; list did not get lawyers, lawyers just take your money to do lame stuff for something like this. Handle it yourself as far as you can, just get the relevant questions laid out and answered first.. <br /><br />Maybe consider reaching out to the judiciary - call a local prosecutor and ask if your name has come up when he works with his officers, and you play it that the thought of you ever asking any kind of prosecutor if they had any interest in you is very surprising because you assumed the police and/or sheriff could answer this question.&nbsp; Take it from there. But go this direction so you&#039;re not off-track..
