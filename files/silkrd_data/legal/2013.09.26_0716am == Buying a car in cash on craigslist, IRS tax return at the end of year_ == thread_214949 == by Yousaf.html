				If I buy a 30k car on craigslist with drug money through a private sale on Craigslist and my income is only $34,000 a year, how would I go about handling this at the end of the year with my tax return?&nbsp; I will pay my $1000 worth in taxes when I buy the car and register it but how unwise is this decision?

				Well I guess it could possibly attract some unwanted attention but its not like they could make a case of income tax evasion stick.&nbsp; How could they possible prove that you haven&#039;t been saving cash since you were a little kid so that one day you could buy a nice car straight up?&nbsp; They don&#039;t know how long you have been saving.&nbsp; Unless you have only claimed $30,000 in income for your whole life time I would think you are fine.&nbsp; Again though, it might make someone pay more attention to what you&#039;re doing.

				Why do you think all those rappers sing things like &quot;Got everything in my momma name. But I&#039;m hood rich&quot;.. Don&#039;t let eyes get on you. Unwise decision. Keep your 10 year old Toyota Corolla.<br /><br />OR, if you must, find someone who would like to take a 30k gambling loss, and you take 30k in gambling earnings. pay tax on that.&nbsp; But buying expensive things you don&#039;t need is like asking to get unwanted attention...

				So buying a car through a private sale on craigslist, paying in cash, and paying taxes while registering the car ($1200 total in taxes) is no bueno?&nbsp; I figured I already paid my taxes so what&#039;s the big deal?

				Why can&#039;t you tell the seller when you want to buy to car to say you paid $10k-15k when you switch titles. It looks a lot better than 30k. When you transfer the title they will ask why they are selling under kbb or what not and you can list a variety of reasons/problems with the car such as blown engine/transmission problems/major body damage as if you were in a hit and run and it wasnt reported to insurance to show why its listed low. I&#039;ve done it a lot actually when I buy cars and pay a lot less in taxes. If it was a cheaper car you could have them gift it and pay no taxes too, but its not reasonable to do that with a 30k car it will attract attention. No one needs to know what your actually paying.

				I like having a car that looks like a piece of shit. Key word is LOOKS. Way less of a cop magnet, and less likelyhood of a random break in. Maybe buy a cheapo and just mod it to fuck?

But 15k is a lot more believable than 30k.

				The problem with reporting lower than paid is that you are asking the dealer to turn his clean profits into dirty money. Not sure how hard that is to find.<br /><br />What exactly constitutes the title though? The chassis? The engine? Why could you not then buy the core of the car for under $10k then purchase the remainder in small parts equalling $30k? You could say the sale was for parts and later you changed your mind.
