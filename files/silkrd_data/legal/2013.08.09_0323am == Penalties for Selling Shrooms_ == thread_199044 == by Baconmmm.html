				Jesus, draconian much?<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t even go to jail if I was caught with 50 grams of shrooms. American drugs laws are the worst in the civilized world.

				There was a fascinating period of a couple of years up to end July 2005 when the Home Office in the UK found that they didn&#039;t have any legislative powers over FRESH shrooms, and they went on open sale in many places. You could go to Camden market in London, check out some nice shoes and rare records, have a good cappucino, and then buy any number of varieties of shrooms from the stalls.<br /><br />The streets were not filled with zombies. The hospitals were not stuffed to the gills with psych casualties. Western civilisation did not come crashing down in slo-mo to a soundtrack of Dutch gabba. And now they are Class A, equivalent to smack.<br /><br />Obviously reason and logic won out.<br /><br />Take care.

Its legal to posses any amount of shrooms as long as you do not &quot;know&quot; that they are magic shrooms i.e. you found them in the wild or got them from someone who found them in the wild. See Fiske vs. State of Florida. Its legal to posses and grow shrooms in New Mexico as long as its for personal use. Erowid is a great source for drug law info.
