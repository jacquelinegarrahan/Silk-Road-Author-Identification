				So recently a longtime &quot;friend&quot; burglarized my home for thousands in cash that he knew might be there due to my giving him a loan to start paying his child support so he wouldn&#039;t have to spend extra time in jail. <br /><br />The circumstances of the robbery leave me with very little evidence outside of the circumstantial, although it is overwhelming. I know he did this as he was literally the only person with knowledge of the cash, and the general vicinity of where it was likely hidden. Nothing else was disturbed or taken. It appeared that nowhere else in the house were valuables even looked for, and there was a plethora in plain view. He does not have a solid alibi by any means, and has been recently in a very desperate situation so I know he is capable of something like this. <br /><br />The issue now really comes with the fact that when I confronted him, stated my certainty of his guilt, and pointed out the myriad holes and inconsistencies in his story he immediately called the police and reported me for &quot;harassing&quot; him and said god knows what else to the police. Now this guy has a pretty decent criminal record, nothing too crazy but he has a recent history with our local pd.<br /><br />&nbsp;So my local lieutenant or whatever calls me on my cell phone, this guy apparently gave him my number, and he seemed more interested in my side of the story than this guy&#039;s lies. I reluctantly filed a statement on the robbery and my evidence as well as the statement of his former employer whom days before ripping me off, he stole from as well. I have to tread very carefully though due to this SR thing obv, and some other things of mine going on locally and elsewhere. There is no direct evidence unfortunately, and my local cops are fucking dipshits anyway. They don&#039;t care about helping me it seems, and they likely assume it is drug money involved in this drama. I have no criminal record and have never been arrested, thankfully. I don&#039;t even get moving violations or parking tickets anymore. <br /><br />What I am worried about now, is when I had pressed him on some details that could exonerate him, and that he originally offered to provide (I don&#039;t want to get too detailed) he now refuses to comply to prove me wrong...because he&#039;s unable. He&#039;s changed his story up a good bit, but now he claims to have told the cops everything he knows about the details of my business. He was privy to some information (not everything) because the only people I have known longer than him are in my immediate family, so I trusted him to a certain extent. This was my first mistake, I know. So now he is claiming that he&#039;s a ratted me out, and &quot;I&#039;m a drug dealer blah,blah. I didn&#039;t steal your money, you&#039;re a crazy drug addict.&quot; He was rather proud of this it seems and now is claiming to yet again report me to the police for some bullshit in bothering him to support his alibi. I simply asked him very cordially via a text to provide the further proof to seal his alibi, which he just cannot do. He has been actively engaging in texts with me and has initiated conversation himself, so there is not much room to argue I am harassing him. <br /><br />My big worry is how serious do you guys think the cops would take his information about my business. He has no proof nor anyone to corroborate his statements and hardly could be considered reliable. But my general feeling is that although my local pd has it out for this guy, they probably wouldn&#039;t mind busting me as well if they could. This has just turned into a cluster fuck, and I know I should just pack up and move out of town like I have been planning to for awhile now, but I can&#039;t stand to let this go and see this fucker get away scot free. I just need some insight really into how much I should worry about his big mouth and whether or not they would have enough from just his statements to start looking at me closer. I have pretty much assumed the worst, and have been preparing for the worst. It&#039;s just unbelievable, what kind of man rips you off, and then that&#039;s not enough they have to try and ruin your life because they&#039;re scared and can&#039;t face the consequences of being a shit bag.

				bb: That was/is obviously my first reaction to this remarkable bullshit. He thought he could hide at first, and that I wouldn&#039;t go after him/them, but it didn&#039;t take all of five minutes to find where they&#039;re hold up. The &quot;harassment&quot; thing he called about, and the woman filing a trespass warning against me for &quot;speaking&quot; with her from the sidewalk when she was outside the house is all just a fucking twisted manipulation of our atrocious justice system. They know that I will be the first person the cops talk to if they end up with no knee caps, or in a coma. I have to back off for now anyway, and the best thing is to forget this, move on, and move away. But I just can&#039;t let this go it seems.

				It sounds like you know what you need to do: forget about your grievance with this scumbag for now and consider your own safety. From the sound of it the police are unlikely to find any evidence linking him to the theft of your money. On the other hand, if he has ratted you out as a drug dealer, and.....well.....you ARE selling drugs, then I guess you have to consider your business compromised. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously I don&#039;t know the details of your business. But if I was involved in drug dealing, and knew that somebody had informed the police, my first priority would be covering my own ass. You can worry about payback for this so called friend later. He&#039;s already taken your money but you can get more money. Don&#039;t let your rightful anger blind you to the risks and end up in jail.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You ask at the end how much you need to worry about what he has said to the police. Realistically you can&#039;t know this with any sureness.<br />You can&#039;t trust his word on what he has told the police, and you can&#039;t second guess what the polices reaction will be. They could not give a shit, or they could be looking into you. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Go with your gut and walk away.

				Sorry to hear about this man.&nbsp; Def. not cool of your &quot;friend&quot;.&nbsp; That&#039;s no friend if he/she did take the money.&nbsp; But anyways in regards to should you be worried?&nbsp; I think it mostly has to do with where you live and the size of your business.&nbsp; Let me tell you a short story.&nbsp; <br /><br />Back in college I was seeing this girl whose best friend was the baby mama of my dealer.&nbsp; Well those two had a falling out and she was pissed as hell at him (the dealer).&nbsp; So she called up the cops and was telling them all about this and that and what he was doing in terms of dealing.&nbsp; The police told her yeah we already know about that guy.&nbsp; And that was pretty much the end of it.&nbsp; Now we&#039;re taking about a major metropolitan area here in the US.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands of people in the city.&nbsp; And my dealer was about as low on the dealing chain as you can be.&nbsp; He was one step from the end users and only pushed some pills, coke, and a little weed.&nbsp; He couldn&#039;t afford a car and basically was just dealing to pay for rent, food, child support and that&#039;s it.&nbsp; So moral to the short story is if you&#039;re small time and the police have better things to do, you probably don&#039;t have much to worry about.&nbsp; If you&#039;re big time though or if you live in bum fuck egypt I might be laying real low for awhile.&nbsp;

				&quot;Friend&quot; is right. Emphasis on the quotes. <br />police involvement scares me the most, maybe jsut cut ties with the &quot;friend&quot; he&#039;ll eventually find himself in jail and nothing he can rob you of will keep him out.

				I can&#039;t let this get to any further involvement with the police. I can take the hit on the cash, not the end of the world, but his spitefulness because he&#039;s scared and can&#039;t man up to what he&#039;s done is fucking pathetic. <br /><br />This man is twice my size and he&#039;s running and hiding and calling the cops as a last ditch attempt to avoid an imminent life altering event that he knows will come his way eventually. His guilt was all too clear from the beginning for me to pretend like I didn&#039;t know immediately. That may have worked out like you say Heisenberg, but I initially had him dead to rights and gave him a chance to make it right. Return the money no questions asked, or whatever he had left with a promise. I even arranged a way he could do this without a face-to-face exchange. But, no dice. He couldn&#039;t take the easy way out and preferred to just up the ante. He may be bluffing about ratting to scare me away from and him and out of town. Why tell me about it if you did something that will only serve to enrage me further, and anger other people that he needs to worry about now? <br /><br />He&#039;ll get his eventually, karma is a motherfucker, thieves don&#039;t prosper, and he&#039;ll slip up again very,very soon. He doesn&#039;t have a license due to DUIs, and he can&#039;t/won&#039;t really leave the area. That is good at least, as he&#039;d have to go outside of a 50-60 mile radius to not be within reach of people that are keeping an eye out for him.

				He isn&#039;t a credible witness by any means and he has no corroboration to support his claims. That would be the qualifier for the police to take his information as usable and go forward from there. But the thought that he may of simply put that idea into their heads is just as bad to me as him being a prove, reliable cooperative informant or something to that degree. Why stoop to that level? Only a coward can act like that, and there are only so many holes to hid in.&nbsp;

Getting robbed from someone you trusted is always a depressing situation.<br /><br />Since he has told the police about your drug dealing, I would take that seriously. You should make it a priority to rid your house of all controlled substances and illegal paraphernalia associated with it. I would just take it easy for awhile. The police may be taking your former friends allegations seriously, so it would be in your best interest to take the necessary measures to keep yourself safe.<br /><br />Best of wishes, sorry the situation got blown out of proportion and has gotten to this point. Will keep my fingers crossed for you.

				I see it as a bluff.<br />I doubt this dude really informed the police with anything useful.<br />I imagine they&#039;re looking at that retard a lot more closely than they are you.<br />He&#039;s the one with a criminal history afterall. <br /><br />My advice.<br />Lay low for a min, if you are worried. <br />Leave the dude alone and try to distance yourself from him.<br />Certainly don&#039;t assault him or anything along those lines in order to get your money back.<br />That will probably just bring more trouble on your part.<br /><br />Karma is a bitch, like you said.<br />He WILL get his. Eventually.<br /><br />Hate to hear this happened to you, man.<br />Keep us informed. <br /><br />Best of luck.

				IMO<br /><br />go Sorpanos mode on his ass. Extort him and make his life hell until he has paid for what he has done. dont just send a message, tell him you want your money back or its going to be bad for him. Just make sure you have a good circle of friends that will go along with an alibi and make sure you have a good one set up for every time you pay him a visit. Just like you dont negotiate with terrorism, dont let slimy mother fuckers take advantage of you.<br /><br />one of my friends had something similar happen to him. We are going to beat him senseless until he pays back everything he took. If the cops get involved, we will have plenty of people to say that we were all hanging out together smoking blunts, way too high to be out whooping someones ass.<br /><br />maybe not the best idea, but I think it would work.

				You need to think about your own best interests in this situation and forget about revenge for now. If you&#039;re gonna get him, do it in 12 months when he&#039;s probably forgotten about the whole situation.<br /><br />In the mean-time you should text him something like:<br />&quot;Look man we&#039;ve been friends for ages and at the end of the day that&#039;s worth more to me than a couple grand. If you say you didn&#039;t do it I&#039;m gonna trust you and take your word for it.&quot;<br /><br />After this just hang out with him semi-regularly so he still thinks you&#039;re mates but make sure he thinks you&#039;ve stopped dealing, pretend to be broke.<br /><br />Then once everything blows over you can randomly pick him up out of the blue without any notice, hand him a beer with a knockout dose of opiates in it and take him for a drive. That&#039;s the best way to snatch someone, you always drug them with opiates so if the car gets pulled over they just look like a junkie on the nod for a couple hours. I wouldn&#039;t kill him personally, probably just drive him really far out to the woods, force him to consume an extremely unpleasant cocktail of drugs (maybe a HUGE dose of LSD combined with a decent amount of MDPV for extra anxiety) and leave him there without without a wallet or phone. If he didn&#039;t die he&#039;d at least need to spend a week in the psych ward and if he ever went to the cops he&#039;d just look like a junkie. That&#039;d be enough revenge for me.

				i think aussiemitch had the best advice. if thats something you can do id wait for a while and then when he and the pigs forget about the whole thing make him dissapear. idk about other people but stealing, especially when its a large amount of money and from someone i trusted and called a friend, i have trouble letting go. the person would need to dissapear.

				You know what to do.<br />Clean house and stop all your activity.

It&#039;s not worth it for you.<br /><br /><br />In a few years, if you&#039;re still pissed at the guy, find him outside of a bar one day and absolutely beat the fucking shit out of him, it shouldn&#039;t be hard to find him if he&#039;s such a loser, he&#039;ll still be around his usual spots.<br />If you do do this, make sure he cant find out it was you.

				I personally would have a set plan. It seems that your &quot;friend&quot; has given any secrets about you he knows to the police, most of these secrets I would assume involve drugs. I would suggest you clean out any illegal items from your house and store them somewhere else. If you have no place, buy a large chest, put everything in there, and bury it in a nearby forest. This way you can go back and retrieve your items later. Once this is done it&#039;s just a waiting game, after a few months if nothing comes of it then you can assume nothing will come of it. <br /><br />If you&#039;re 100% positive this was the guy who stole your belongings, then while you&#039;re waiting for everything to blow over, I would hire a hitman or do the dirty work yourself. Anyone who&#039;s so evil as to steal from the person who helped them dearly, deserves death. From what you&#039;ve told us this guy is just a down-right horrible person. They are a poison to society and you won&#039;t be the first or last person they hurt. If you plan on taking care of it yourself you must execute your plan perfectly. Any mistakes will result in you having a minimum of 20 years in jail and not being able to apply for a job.<br /><br />Good luck and never be afraid, any cop or official is just another person like you but with a special uniform.
