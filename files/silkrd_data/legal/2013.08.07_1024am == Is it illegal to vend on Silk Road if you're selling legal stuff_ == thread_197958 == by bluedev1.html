				Why would that be illegal if you declared your income for tax etc?<br /><br />But I wouldn&#039;t put it past the US DoJ to charge you under RICO or something. Maybe a nebulous conspiracy charge.

				Hmmm, I don&#039;t see how that could be illegal especially if you aren&#039;t supporting any criminal activity.&nbsp; There was once a vendor early on selling cookies on the market... regular chocolate chip cookies... no special ingredients.&nbsp; In that case it would be like arresting Mrs Fields for selling her cookies in a vending machine filled with crack.

				I don&#039;t think that&#039;s correct.&nbsp; There is nothing illegal about installing, browsing, and discussing SR.&nbsp; Once you make an illegal purchase, now its illegal. There several new commentators with screen shots of SR on the clear net forums, they had to get them somehow?&nbsp; One went as far as buying bitcoins, and wanting to buy a book (I don&#039;t know if book was legal or not), no longer in print?, but the book was sold before the news commentators could buy it.&nbsp; So, she searched the net to see what see could buy for her $30 in bitcoins and found some restaurant in Mexico that took bitcoins (I thinks it was Mexico).&nbsp; But that&#039;s a true story, you may find the video on you-tube.

SR tumbles the coins, so the coins that one receives may be in part from an illicit transaction. <br /><br />Try ebay tbh. This place just isn&#039;t meant for the faint of heart.&nbsp; I&#039;d even wager that they&#039;d take this person down just to show that &quot;they got a SR user.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />You can even accept bitcoin for a transaction, using another intermediary like SR.

				Legality aside (er, or not), if you think about it, it&#039;d be fucked up for LE to go after a vendor who sells syringes or testing kits. That&#039;s like going after well-intentioned/unauthorized needle exchange programs.

If your local bartender sells MJ to anyone who asks there is no law against ordering a beer from him, if you are 21. If a local strip club is used to launder money there is no law against visiting it, tipping the girls, and ordering your drinks. <br /><br />Maybe in theory some sort of case could be made, but I don&#039;t think there is any kind of precedent to support it. As long as what you are selling is legal, you have the right to sell it, and you pay your taxes on it.<br /><br />I could certainly be wrong as I am no expert.

Would have to be a vendor using the money they make to buy the cookies you&#039;re selling.
