				What jobs are left?<br /><br />I can&#039;t make shoes for a living, as the last name &quot;shoemacher&quot; once implied. <br />I can&#039;t stitch together cloth or clothing. I could, but I think we all know most people buy from Wal-mart or Target or another bigger store.<br /><br />And a desk job or fast food? Pay is bad- and I feel like I&#039;m nothing more than a cog in the machine, working for someone else.<br /><br />I want some money, but I don&#039;t want to pretend that making shoes for people to wear is a viable source of it.<br /><br />If only there was something that I could produce on my own, something I could sell, something people would buy, and something people would buy again and again, providing me with a source of renewable income...<br /><br />We all know the answer. <br /><br />Weed is the solution. <br />If lower income communities had the ability to grow and sell legal weed, they would have a product that they can sell that people want that could make them money so they can live well.<br />This happens already, of course, but due to government forces, this does not happen in a manageable way. <br /><br />If the law made it so you could not have more than say, 10 pounds of weed at once, either personal, or owned by your company, that would empower personal growers and give them the ability to sell weed to people without worrying about huge competition from major weed corporations. <br />This would give a LOT of people jobs doing something. It&#039;s not like the world needs 7 billion people, so if a person wants to innovate housing or clothing, they will do that, but what if you just want to live a normal life, but you don&#039;t want to be a corporation&#039;s bitch slave?<br /><br />Like growing tobacco isn&#039;t very effective when you have to compete with that camel company (I don&#039;t smoke), growing weed with big corporations also growing it will doom personal sellers fast.<br />But if we kept weed grow and sell operations smaller, that would empower lots of people to be able to have a source or income, despite automation taking more of our jobs.<br /><br />Does this sound sane?<br /><br />(My ideal is NO government whatsoever, but in a realistic setting, this idea seems like it&#039;d work. Force companies to be smaller by not taxing them, but simply limiting the amount of product they can sell. Caps, but only to allow other people to also start up companies with less competition, giving more people jobs, allowing the world to be a more fair place.)
