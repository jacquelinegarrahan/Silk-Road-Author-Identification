				My friend told me that they&#039;re legal, but how could he be so sure? <br /><br />Thank you to all who respond.

				Depends on what country you&#039;re in, what the chemicals specifically are (&quot;research chemical&quot; could mean anythingâ€” though it most frequently means 4-AcO-DMT and 2Cs) how good a lawyer you have, and then what judge you get.<br /><br />The shortest most general answer is, no. Best not to get caught. But sometimes yes. MXE is a good example now for the US. If I am not mistaken it is totally legal free and clear.<br /><br />It not only depends on what country, but also what state and can matter what quantity. Look at the laws for salvia, for example.

				Analog acts make it so nothing is 100% legal no matter what, so the short answer is no. But the long answer is, it depends. <br />

				If you&#039;re in the US, tell your friend to do their research.<br /><br />First, define &quot;research chemical.&quot; Name something Dr. Shulgin worked on, it&#039;s been scheduled in some form or another. Look up documentaries on &quot;bath salts&quot; that discuss the whole concept of designer drugs. If one thing&#039;s chemical composition is named illegal, just adjust the chemical structure to make a new chemical that is now quasilegal, but not the same as the illegal one previously. <br /><br />Overall, research chemicals are going to be illegal in all cases, because their chemical composition, synthesis process, effects and risks are known. Maybe not known very well or in-depth, as reflected in Erowid&#039;s warnings regarding RC&#039;s, but they are undoubtedly recognized by LE, and that&#039;s the answer to your question right there.

				Yup, also if you do get caught with them, admit nothing.&nbsp; As far as you know you have an interest in chemistry and that&#039;s it.&nbsp; Do not ever admit that it&#039;s for human consumption.&nbsp; Now if you get caught with them and they are bagged up or ready to go or in weight, IDK

				They are illegal if the intent is for human consumption. It&#039;s getting easier and easier for LEO to prove intent for human consumption so proceed with caution.

				some are some are not. Just get the chemical name at the back of the back match it to the CAS number online. You will get all the information you need online. Or type the brand name and if theres a discussion on the forum you will find out more.
