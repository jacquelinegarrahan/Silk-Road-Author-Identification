				You don&#039;t have anything to worry about. The irony is that LE already knows everything there is to know about ML while nobody around here, who&#039;s putting forward ideas, has a clue as far as I can tell.

				Money Laundering is simple, it&#039;s well researched, enforced and funded at the IRS level with lots of forensic accountants that pick up on common schemes and complacent, routine financial recording that many people resort to after getting bored of changing things up. <br /><br />Why you shouldn&#039;t answer these questions is simple. If a vendor can&#039;t figure out how to convert BTC to cash anonymously, or at the very least develop a layered system of laundering, you don&#039;t want to buy from them. I think we should have some kind of intelligence test before allowing vendors to sell on SR, or maybe an increase in fees should they fail to make the passing score. Silk Road is a unique community of people consisting of many that have a high level of intelligence/experience in both street life and in academic and formal studies. There are some that make me wonder if 1 idiot left a computer on SR in a library, and another idiot saw it and got involved, and also forgot to close the browser, etc, etc. But for the most part we&#039;re smart, elusive, and probably not the people you want to fuck with anyway. <br /><br />Those who need to ask the very competitors and customers who they will end up dealing with for advice on a key activity to success selling restricted products, that so many managed to outsmart long before the internet, don&#039;t fit the intelligence standards that I see fosters success in vendors.

				Excellent post, National Direct. Someone else on the forum mentioned a similar concern, that kids using SR have never dealt/bought on the street so they don&#039;t have a working &quot;sketchmeter&quot; to tell them when something is up. I try to keep that sort of thing in mind when on the forums, that many here are inexperienced and could fuck up any day.

				I quite enjoy the conversations and exchange of ideas. To be honest no one talks about specifics for the most part. What they do talk about is more methodology. LE knows the methods. It&#039;s doubtful anyone here will come up with something totally brand new, even if they did without details of where, what, and when it would only be a method. I mean thats like saying the method for making M. So what if the method is out there? if you don&#039;t have the abilities, knowledge, connections, resources and network available then knowing the method doesn&#039;t help one bit. For anyone who does have the fore mentioned the method in itself doesn&#039;t make anything they are doing more or less risky. If they have done things correctly then they shouldn&#039;t be at risk.

				There are still to do this day very untraceable methods that exist.&nbsp; Money talks. And police or whatever le don&#039;t have a clue.&nbsp; Everything on here is basic information that was sold on and on with no strategy or long term plan. And also anonymity. Now a lot think they are experts in money laundering.&nbsp; Serious launderers won&#039;t even entertain most vendors here
