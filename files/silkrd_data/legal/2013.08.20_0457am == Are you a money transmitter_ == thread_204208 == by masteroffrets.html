				Im a btc vendor under a different name here. So i recently registered a business and would like to open a business bank account. I plan on registering as a money service business with fin cen but not with my state. Should i check the box asking if i am a msb? What will happen if i check yes? will i be required to get a state lisence? i get the feeling most of these people taking cash deposit for payment of coins just check no. Or should i use an annoymous bank acount somehow?

				Its nice that you are trying to go legit but its not even worth it. If you want to be a MSB, you need a licence in every state that your customers reside. Becoming in MSB in all states takes around $2million and a couple years to get registered. <br /><br />So you mine as well just skip the MSB. But beware that if the bank finds out what you are doing, they will most likely freeze your business account.

				You can say you day trade currencies. Probably should double check that with a cpa/lawyer first though, as I am neither. At the very least do your own research on your local laws.

				I opened an account at a local credit union. I told them I would be selling bitcoins for cash they didnt have a problem with it. I deposit cash(only me) and wire about 5-10k a week, no problems so far. Its only been 3 weeks ive been up and running though. <br />My thoughts were exactly the same. They probably let em grow their business till they get big then freeze em when theirs as much money as they want in the account haha.
