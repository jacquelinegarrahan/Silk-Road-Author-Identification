				So, you&#039;ve been before the judge or magistrate and you said it was fine... <br /><br />was this alone or did you have a public benefit such as an attorney or pd speaking for you? <br /><br />or are we just talking traffic issues :)

				A true dedicated human who must live as his/her heart demands to be their own sovereign being, the nature being granted by creation itself, having a will towards non subservience, will not be asking for a lawyer who, while maybe they are just an honest great guy/gal, THEIR allegiance is to the courts and the courts alone. Which is allegiant to the vatican. Which claims ownership of the entire world. It&#039;s written somewhere. Complete sovereign ownership declared to the world of the world. <br /><br />Every defense lawyer absolutely wants the slightly less than short route to your freedom. They gotta get paid too folks. And who decided that your bowing down to the courts and following THEIR interests was just the way things are? Because you do give up your own personal jurisdiction each time you answer as the corporate fiction that is YOUR NAME. You are assumed competent to understand you are claiming surety for whatever commercial account they&#039;ve managed to weasel into THEIR court. <br /><br />So maybe eventually we can get some blokes in here that have actually stood out the 24/48 hour/ or 2 weeks of detainment without offering up a goddam thing. Especially their corporate fiction assigned to them through the slave contract (the birth certificate). I can&#039;t say what I&#039;d do if I faced processing. So I&#039;m just talking a bunch of bullshit here. <br /><br />But I will never get a lawyer ever. <br /><br />Anyone, anyone? bueller?

				OP has a very good point. Simply because all decisions are made behind closed doors in the &quot;judges chambers&quot; prior to the public announcement and recording thereof. They&#039;re all members of the same club and it&#039;s private. This club is not that old... do some research on the BAR people. There were lawyers and judges before a BAR association ever existed... It&#039;s a rigged game. And it comes down to WHAT or WHO you know no matter what path you choose!

				Who gives the BAR its &quot;author-ity&quot;.. the sheeple of course and their mis-under-standing of law and our history in general. The population at large still believes &quot;history&quot; or His-story as its told the side of the victor being that of the international bankers that conquered this country by starting the civil war. The war of 1812 was started because of the failing of the &quot;First Bank of the United States&quot; (congress refused to renew their charter&quot;. The &quot;Second bank of the US&quot; was instated after the US finally gave up behind closed doors in 1816. This bank was also defeated once their charter was up albeit 5 years after the charter was up they continued central banking operations. So the final blow was indeed the Civil War (Divide and Conquer). Once the newest version of these older banking entities was instated (The Federal Reserve - Check their website they own up to their previous banks!!!!!!) World War I immediately began and our culture of war was installed and has continued (previously the US had a non-interventionalist policy as we were ALL FARMERS!). The law has been corrupted ever since the Civil war, vague understanding and complacency has led the Republic to its demise! The North never won a damned thing, we all lost and we don&#039;t even know it!&nbsp; :&#039;(<br /><br />People need to do their research, it seems most people with this truth are dismissed as crazy or conspiracy theorists. It&#039;s unreal though because we are programmed to think that anything that&#039;s not generally accepted by the masses of the sheeple at large is &quot;crazy&quot;. You are what you eat people! CATTLE!!!!
