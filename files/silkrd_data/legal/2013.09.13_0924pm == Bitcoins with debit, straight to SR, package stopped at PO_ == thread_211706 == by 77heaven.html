				Hi everyone!<br /><br />The title is totally hypothetical. It hasn&#039;t happened to me but the point is that I&#039;m considering buying bitcoins with my debit/credit card from somewhere like localbitcoins.com. If I were to do this, then transfer the bitcoins straight from my localbitcoins wallet to SR, and then use that to buy, say, a small amount of weed or LSD or something (clearly for personal use, small amounts and nothing hard such as H or coke etc). Would I be asking for trouble?<br /><br />For extra information I of course use PGP and have Tor and the PGP software on a separate USB. Obviously I think my main concern would be buying bitcoins online but from various SR guides this appears to be quite common (although that might be because people are lazy idk).<br /><br />Any help on this matter would be very much appreciated.

				I never heard of sending them to the fog so I wouldn&#039;t do that just yet until somebody else replies. <br /><br />If I was you, you should send them from localbitcoins to blockchain my wallet then SR. I believe SR tumbles the coins so its really hard to trace those exact coins you purchased back to SR. I&#039;m pretty sure that would be the safest bet.

				If you&#039;re buying bitcoin in a way that can be traced back to you, such as with a bank account or thru an exchange that has verified you,&nbsp; its a good idea to send your coins thru BitcoinFog before you send them to your SR wallet.<br /><br />The great thing about localbitcoins.com, though, is that there are many different ways you can purchase coin without leaving a trace back to you.

				To be completely honest.. most of us think and know you&#039;ll be 100% safe..&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But if your being watched, which your prob not, hypothetically, well that transaction can be traced back to you by a good investigator.

				So debit/credit card purchase instead of f2f on localbitcoins? sad. is there no one in your area?<br /><br />These BTC won&#039;t see the light of day until taken out of SR economy by a vendor, so unless you got the BTC to perform a bad buy, that purchase wouldn&#039;t be of great concern - it is not as risky as some are making it out to be.
