				I am fairly new to the darknet, and I was wondering if anybody knew of any specific forum to discuss and learn about the safest and most preventative ways of distributing LSD. Not large scale, but as in 2 vials per month. Does anyone have any experience with this? Any specific readings or tips you could offer? The reason is partly for help paying rent, but the joy out of giving people the oppurtunity to have this experience is the biggest reason for doing so. Where is the best forum for discussing this topic of drug sale. Thank you all

				&nbsp; It is safe, as long as you use a sophisticated method of stealth for international shipments.&nbsp; 2 vials a month might not be bad.&nbsp; Remember, the police/customs are not looking for LSD, so never, ever, ever, label your product as anything other than legitimate, never give any clue as to what it actually is.&nbsp; For liquid, you&#039;re going to have to use some sweet breath or an herbal remedy type of product, regional to your area.&nbsp; Even perfume, comes in small sample vials, and if you set up a webpage hosted somewhere with just a company name and contact info, you could easily change it, and pass yourself off as a perfumist/herbal healer.&nbsp; These are just a few ideas, eyedrops and breath-drops have been used successfully by other vendors as a delivery method.&nbsp; I would go for essential oils and just smear some kind of wintergreen or other oil on the lid of the vial, for good measure.&nbsp; The shipping and security threads would be the best place to look, sorry for giving such a long response! good luck!
