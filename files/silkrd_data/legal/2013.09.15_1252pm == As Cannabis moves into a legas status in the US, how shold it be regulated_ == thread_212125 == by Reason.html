				Hello SR friends,<br /><br />This is an interesting question when asked from the point of view of the Cannabis user.&nbsp; As Cannabis moves into a legas status in the US, how shold it be regulated?<br /><br />What standards should be applied (if any), this would possibly include:<br /><br />lableing<br />safety standards/inspections<br />taxation<br />production licensing <br />use restrictions (and related penalties for violation)<br /><br />What think you?<br /><br />R.<br /><br /><br />

				If a government were capable of proper regulation at all;<br /><br />Banning of all carcinogenic PGRs (paclo, ect) for use on Cannabis crops within an unsafe timeframe prior to harvest (i.e. PGRs used only on plants in vegetative growth phase). Same goes for miticides, insecticides, fungicides, ect.<br /><br />Strict regulations on nursery management to halt the spread of Cyclamen/Broad mites, Spider Mites, various other pests, Powdery Mildew, Botrytis.<br /><br />Random reservoir/soil tests (for hydro/soil, respectively) to insure a lack of carcinogenic/toxic material.<br /><br />Assaying prior to reaching market for proof that product is lacking aflatoxins (actual harmful toxins produced in composting molds, not just PM/botrytis that only affect taste/potency), and of course potency assaying. <br /><br />Since governments in their current form are entirely incompetent and incapable of acting as neutral mediating entity;<br /><br />Self regulating free market, trusted entities voluntarily testing crops and reputable farms volunteering samples. Something akin to a stamp or seal on trusted brands which have all crops tested by third party, and then the paclo drenched garbage herb thats gonna kill you in 10 years for the &quot;Marlboro Green&quot; packs at 711.<br />

				I like the idea of some sort of trusted third party Cannabis industry standards setter, quality/safety evaluator, and perhaps one that does some research.&nbsp; Something like the Underwriters Labs, but for Cannabis.<br /><br />I can really appreciate what the previous poster said about the many things that could/should be done to ensure both quality and safety of Cannabis.<br /><br />Maybe if the industry can begin to establish some sort of self regulation, big brother will lay off?<br /><br />R.

				Sigh.<br /><br />The people that are shouting &quot;NO REGULATION. THATS REDICULOUS. I THINK MORE CLEAR WHEN IM HIGH. THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY. BLAH BLAH&quot;, you guys are half the problem with leagalizing weed. Act like you haven&#039;t done something absolutely retarded while driving a car that you wouldnt have done if you were 100% sober. If you havent, you at least have been in the car with someone that is driving that is high that has done something retarded that they normally wouldnt have. Like run a blatanly red light and then say, &quot;HEHEHE OOPS. HIT THE BLUNT ONE TIME TOO MANY&quot;.<br /><br />It shouldnt be regulated as hard as alcohol as far as restrictions in daily life, but the fucking bus driver shouldnt be smoking a dooby while hes merging onto the highway with 50 kindergarteners in the back.

				its simple though i dont want it legalized or regulated just decriminalized because lets face it when it becomes legal all over the United States the market for weed falls down the crapper no one will be making any real tax free cash, all because the government thinks they have the right to regulate what goes in our bodies using their shitty laws.. for what? &quot;public safety&quot; wake up people if you dont feel safe dont live in the country and dont have children here. simple as that its because fags like you that we all get punished i dont give a fuck if so and so died from a drunk driver.. if you didnt feel safe driving and taking that risk then dont drive dont ruin everyone elses good time. the same comparision can be made for everything made illegal Fuck The System man. But obviously do what you do responsibly as well.

				Simple go check out how they have been doing it in Holland.<br />They have legalized it in the 70s and seem to do ok.<br /><br />At some stage they were planning to enforce a weed card for Ducth users only<br />Due to neightbouring countries complaining that it was Holland&#039;s fault<br />they had a drug problem. But after a bit of complaining they seemed to have<br />scraped that idea and gotten rid of the wietpass.<br /><br />Rules in Holland:<br /><br />*Weed is labeled<br />*They tax it.<br />*18+ of age (used to be 16+)<br />*Not sure if they have random tests among employers?<br />* Free to use for anyone regardsless of your past.<br />*Allowed to carry around 5gr legally(not 100% sure)<br /><br />So I would say yes regulating is good as long as they keep it real.

So would be the same for weed if legal. People having a big night out on the piss might get tested monday morning and told to go home &#039;cos they still have alcohol in the system.<br /><br />As for the weed quality you described. A good analogy would be buying vegetables direct from the farmer vs. from the supermarket. Obviously more people buy from the supermarket and they impose strict control on what produce they accept, whereas people may choose to buy from the farmer because it&#039;s available locally and cheaper, even they it may not &quot;look&quot; as good or go ripe/rotten faster due to less pesticides + lack of cold storage - still doesn&#039;t mean it lacks quality.<br /><br />
