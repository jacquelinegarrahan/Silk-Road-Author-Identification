				SO ive been trading bitcoins for reload cards for a bit now but im running out of cards. Ive created accounts for just about every card that takes REloadit and most have been frozen now. I assume if i try to create a new one in the same name theyll catch on and close it aswell. So i would think the only route would be to use other peoples information. So does anyone know how much of the information has to be right for it to work? Obviosly name and SSN is a must, but will it work if i give fake address and phone number?? I obviously&nbsp; wouldnt want to put down real information for that because it would lead to them realise someone is using their information and the permanent card would be sent to their door. Oh yea id just be using the one you buy at the store and have the real one shipped to some fake address. I would just use for a few reloads, take out the money at an atm and switch to a different card. <br /><br />Anybody have any insite on this? Also does anyone know of a place online where i can get dumps with peoples names and SSN?
