				Mainly out of curiosity but also so I can be more (or less) confident when making orders. But has anyone ever had police contact them because of an order they placed on SR? or someone they know in person was contacted by the Police? If so what happened?

				Yes this happens often, but really only for large amounts, <br />if you are ordering personal use amounts of any drug, you will likely get a letter if it gets caught.

				IF you get a LL (love letter) from customs, generally nothing else will happen. They may ask if you want to come collect you drugs (yeah right), just leave it and you&#039;ll be fine. I&#039;ve had 1 or 2 over the years but never had any problem with buying from any country, though i do move house a fair bit

				No never<br /><br />Got LLs in the past. Nothing happens then or in the future as long as you ignore them.&nbsp; No next step. So ignore them.<br /><br />CDs are used so much less frequently than LLs it&#039;s not a fair comparison...&nbsp; Talking like 10000s to 1...

				Probably more like 100000 to 1, i&#039;ve had a few love letters and that, once lost 2 cartons of cigs out of 10 that i bought and got a letter saying ifi wanted them i had to pay a stupid amount of tax, but also with large quantities of drugs.. customs just dont seem to mind as much as dickhead police. Thats not to say go wold though guys, always be cautious, maybe i just cause a nice guy checking my package :)

				Unless I&#039;m mistaken on a CD they get you to sign for the package first, then after you accept delivery LE shows up with the warrant. If you don&#039;t sign you have plausible deniability that you knew you were receiving what you received. Unless of course after you sign they come in with the warrant and find you snorting/smoking/shooting whatever was in the package. So if you have to sign for something you weren&#039;t supposed to sign for you have a problem,. Most SR vendors, domestic, will never require a signature for receipt. If you are getting something from overseas many times you have to sign for it and there is no way around that, unless there is someone (who isn&#039;t you) at home during the day who will sign for it. Where I live that is an advantage, many times no one is home during delivery hours so the building manager signs for deliveries. That gives plausible deniability even with a CD. In fact they may not even be able to serve the warrant if the addressee isn&#039;t the one who signs. <br />So i would only be worried if I have to sign for something I shouldn&#039;t have to. In that case I would probably refuse to sign saying I wasn&#039;t expecting anything and then they can&#039;t do anything. If it is a letter from Customs because the shipment was from outside the US then they&#039;ll tell you they have seized your shit and you are out of luck. If you are getting something from outside the US you most likely have to sign for it and then you could be screwed.<br />I don&#039;t order from international vendors for just that reason. I should never have to sign for anything and if I&#039;m asked to I know something is up and I refuse to sign and take the loss.

				The answer to the question is &#039;how long is a piece of string?&#039; Different jurisdictions have different policies, and these are subject to change without notice. Personally, if I got a love letter, I&#039;d be absolutely amazed if my name and address didn&#039;t go down on a list somewhere and my incoming OS mail wasn&#039;t subjected to a higher level of scrutiny than regular mail. Note that I&#039;m not saying everything addressed to me from that point onwards is going to be intercepted and scrutinised - just that it would probably be more likely that something addressed to me will flash up on someone&#039;s screen on the way through. Not that it always will. Perhaps the chance of interception would rise from negligible to low. I have no idea - I&#039;m just pissing in the wind like most of us here. <br /><br />Regarding controlled deliveries, common sense would suggest people buying personal quantities won&#039;t be subjected to one. OK, so there may be some temporary crackdown because LE wants to send a message out to the little fish that they shouldn&#039;t expect to slip through the net. You&#039;d be pretty unlucky, though. Consider the resources required to conduct a CD. Obviously, mail is delivered during office hours. Many people aren&#039;t home during office hours - they might be working, on holiday or at a mate&#039;s house getting wasted. If a CD is to take place, LE aren&#039;t just going to assume someone&#039;s home at whatever time&#039;s convenient for them between 9 to 5 and knock on the door. They&#039;re going to carry out some surveillance/do some research to know when their target&#039;s likely to be home, and on top of that they&#039;d surely establish that the target is at home prior to the CD commencing. If the target&#039;s girlfriend answers the door and is willing to sign for the package, I&#039;d say they&#039;d make more effort than usual to insist that the recipient sign, particularly if they know the recipient&#039;s at home. I reckon if a CD is authorised and an LE agent comes back empty-handed, their superior officer is going to ask what the hell happened. Point is that a CD must chew up a significant chunk of resources, and LE are almost always only going to expend these resources on worthwhile targets, not minnows. <br /><br />So if you&#039;re subjected to a CD, you&#039;d surely fall into one of the following categories:<br /><br />- you&#039;re importing significant quantities of narcotics<br />- you&#039;re generally a &#039;person of interest&#039; to LE and they&#039;re looking for a reason to bust you. Clean up your act next time, sheesh.<br />- you&#039;re a small time buyer caught in a sting targeting small-time buyers. Unlucky you, you&#039;re the 0.0001%.<br />- you&#039;re a small time buyer LE wants to use to make a case against whoever it was you bought from. Unlucky you, you&#039;re the 0.001%.<br />- you&#039;re someone the cops want to make an example of, for whatever reason. Perhaps you&#039;re a celebrity, perhaps you&#039;re an irritant.
