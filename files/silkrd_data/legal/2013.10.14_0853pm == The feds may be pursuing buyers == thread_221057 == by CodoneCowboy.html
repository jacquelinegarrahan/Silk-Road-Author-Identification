				A friend of mine in the North Eastern U.S. just received a letter in the mail, allegedly from a heroin vendor from which she made a purchase just a couple days before S.R. went down. She did receive her product safely. She and I are both rather sketched out, since we heard that a few NY-based heroin vendors had been busted, and this was a NY-based vendor. She had only placed one order ever on Silk Road, and it was from this guy. I should also note that, against my advice, she did *not* use PGP to encrypt her address.<br /><br />The letter basically referred vaguely to the fall of Silk Road and provided an email address for her to contact if she wants a &quot;grieving gift&quot; and to get reconnected. <br /><br />We&#039;re concerned that it could be a cop attempting to bust her. I guess it could also be the vendor legitimately trying to find more customers, but why wouldn&#039;t he just set up shop on BMR or Sheep? And in any case, vendors are supposed to delete customer&#039;s address info after shipping. The fact that this person did not do so is super sketchy.<br /><br />I remember reading a thread on the forums about someone having a similar experience recently, which I&#039;m trying to find. Meanwhile, any advice for her besides to ignore the letter?

				Ignore that damn letter. There are plenty of sketchy dealers you can deal with online :)
