You are fucked if you don&#039;t take good care of your accountancy. As someone here once said, setting up an hotdog stand is a good bet :D Those guys can bring in a few thousand a day if the weather is right. It&#039;s easy to shove some extra cash into the registry and print some fake receipts, but you need to be modest. Limetless should be able to tell you more about money laundering if you are willing to pay him a modest fee, what I&#039;ve heard (But only use his services if you are really up for this) .

				hot dog stand isnt going to add up if you have more sales of hot dogs than you do dogs. in the instance u forged receipts of a physical good you could only pad minus the cost of the item, and of course you would have to buy said items. <br /><br />the most optimal way to launder involves the sale of opaque services with no real end physical result and no capital expenses such as employees and recurring costs. the web developer mentioned the existence of sites as a reason not to use this as a front however not all software projects are deployed nor necessarily are all websites maintained by their developers. the irs can demand receipts for sales and purchases but they cant make you prove you did the work, thats usually when the fbi comes in and watches how many hotdogs you&#039;re actually selling. better to say you did some web development work for clients who did not identify themselves and were paid in bitcoin, that way there is no evidence and no way for you to provide receipts short of paying yourself from various dummy addresses.

				Hot dog stands work on a simple idea. if you sell your hot dogs for 5 bucks a pop and hey cost 1 dollar you can launder 4 dollars per dog &quot;sold&quot; <br />The key in it all is if you want to launder say 4k then you must have bought 1000 dogs, buns, ketchup and mustard for those 1000 dogs. <br />At the end of it all you must prove you have bought those dogs, and pay taxes on the sale of those thousand dogs.<br />where it turns to shit is your disposal of the dogs (cuz if you just show up at the dump and toss them you&#039;re leaving a relatively easy trail to follow).&nbsp; <br />The only other issue is if your stand is watched (suspicion of laundering or illegal activity) it hard to say you had 1000 hot dogs sold over the month of Aug if you didn&#039;t go stand on that corner with your stand open, and have people coming up to your stand and walking away with dogs. It&#039;s very easy to watch this type of business (same with laundry services)<br /><br />you might consider something more along the lines of personal training, or consultancy type activity. Being&nbsp; DJ may work as long as you have a venue to work at, the equipment and then your employer would have to back you up on what you were being paid. <br /><br />Working a tip based industry can help clean some funds depending on how much you&#039;re talking about. Then again you have to have the actual job and just supplement your current tips and then pay taxes on them all.

				Maybe it&#039;s a good idea to state first how much you are looking to launder? That might help establish the size of the business necessary to do the washing.

Unfortunately, under the current regulations, both the IRS and HMRC (British Tax Agency) can ask you to provide evidence that indeed you worked said hours as a contractor (same as freelancers) in order to distinguish between the tax arrangements of a contractor and an employee. Good money laundering is about encompassing the whole spectrum of taxation laws and principles and getting too wound up in what seems to be a good idea is really bad practice that even I can be guilty of at times and it is these little tricks which can really nab you in the arse later on because everyone is used to the idea of when LE come knocking, to say nothing and ask for a lawyer. What they don&#039;t understand is, if you keep silent and can&#039;t explain your income, you are automatically going to be hit with an array of charges because it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure their finances are in order and can be explained since the principle is not that the prosecutors need to prove it was gained illegally, but rather the burden of proof is on the individual and business to prove it was gained legally and they complete all required due diligence.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />how are you supposed to prove you did something? is the irs now requiring you film yourself at work?

				I don&#039;t know about the IRS and burden of proof, there are people here that are far better versed in such things than I. <br /><br />What I have noticed is that the burden of proof has seemed to have shifted a lot in the last 20yrs from &quot;innocent to proven guilty&quot; to &quot;prove you&#039;re innocent&quot;<br />I know in practice that some countries have a proceeds of crime laws that allow the police to seize anything they believe obtained illegally and it is the persons job to prove it is theirs. This seems ridiculous but it&#039;s just one more step in big brother controlling it all.<br />As to the burden of proof. This is that statement that so many LE use &quot;if you have nothing to hide then you&#039;ll answer our questions&quot; well LE should be politely told, &quot;sorry, I don&#039;t have to answer anything. Do what you like but I&#039;m an honest law abiding citizen. The only proof I need for that statement is me saying it and until you can prove otherwise that statement is a fact. If you believe that I&#039;m not an honest law abiding citizen please prove that I&#039;m a liar and I&#039;m breaking the law. Bare in mind all conversations will take place with my lawyer present and I may seek compensation for harassment and abuse. Now I&#039;m leaving, or are you arresting me?&quot;<br /><br />NOTE this is not legal advice. don&#039;t state that shit to a cop word for word. use your common sense. <br /><br />sadly and not to get off topic to much but that is the world we live in now, burden of proof was once on the police. Now they simply say what they want and you are charged, or arrested, held, questioned and hopefully after your time is wasted and an emotional toll is taking on you and your family you may be let go. It would be nice if police had to pay a 100$ every time they brought someone in falsely or without real evidence. Right now they just bring people in on fishing expeditions. they have no down side to holding you and questioning you.

				Let me tell you straight away. Do not start a fake business. Be smart. There are a billion small business ideas you can start up for yourself, to launder your money through. Start up a small business, actually work on making it work on its own, and push your illegal money through disguised as legitimate income. Pay your taxes, have some legal justification of where your money is coming from, and you&#039;ll be fine. Most importantly... PAY YOUR TAXES. <br /><br />There&#039;s really no point to starting a fake business. If you simply state cash as income and pay your taxes on it, then you&#039;re fine. Having a business or not will most likely not make any difference on whether they chose to audit you. If they do chose to audit you, you&#039;re going to be screwed if you cannot at least make up a justifiable reason to where your income came from. <br /><br />One example....I know a person who basically acts as a private fitness trainer and consultant for high profile clients. She &quot;makes&quot; $3500 per day doing &quot;this&quot;. She was audited once, declared that her clients being high profile demand anonymity, so all transactions are cash. IRS said okay, all income was documented and accounted for and taxes were paid. Some people might not think it&#039;s that easy, but really, it can be, if your story appears straight. Money Laundering really becomes complicated when people are trying to launder millions + per month, but even that is dooable. Under 100k per month is easy, if you just sit down and take the time to figure it out and work out the kinks.

				the problem with art that it usually requires some kind of receipt. Like most transactions. So it&#039;s a follow the money game. <br /><br />you got paid 2k for your paper clip man? cool who paid you? They didn&#039;t ask for a receipt for the 2k cash they gave you for some paper clips? what about some authentication slip that &quot;you&quot; actually did otherwise how do you prove it&#039;s really made by you and thus making it valuable. starts to get a little tricky there especially if you&#039;re under some kind of investigation already, which is probably why you&#039;re being asked questions in the first place.<br /><br />If you do give a receipt then they follow the money. So who bought the paper clip man.. alright lets look at him. hmm interesting connect the dots. Aside from that where did that guy get 2k to spend on a paper clip man? <br /><br />Art has some potential.. kinda. Think you would need a 3rd party to pay. totally separate.

				I think a dog training and/or dog walking business would be a great starting laundering business. You really don&#039;t need a storefront, you can operate out of your own home. You can get legitamite customers, mixed in with fake receipts with fake names of people that &quot;paid cash&quot; for your dog training services. ;)&nbsp; I love dogs! lolol

This seems ridiculous but it&#039;s just one more step in big brother controlling it all.<br />As to the burden of proof. This is that statement that so many LE use &quot;if you have nothing to hide then you&#039;ll answer our questions&quot; well LE should be politely told, &quot;sorry, I don&#039;t have to answer anything. Do what you like but I&#039;m an honest law abiding citizen. The only proof I need for that statement is me saying it and until you can prove otherwise that statement is a fact. If you believe that I&#039;m not an honest law abiding citizen please prove that I&#039;m a liar and I&#039;m breaking the law.

Now they simply say what they want and you are charged, or arrested, held, questioned and hopefully after your time is wasted and an emotional toll is taking on you and your family you may be let go. It would be nice if police had to pay a 100$ every time they brought someone in falsely or without real evidence.

				Online there are so many ways to launder I wont go into it. <br /><br />But i know a guy from back in the day who used to clean his plant money through cars. Good for amounts between of 5k-50k once a year, small scale stuff. <br /><br />Step 1. Make friends with a mechanic or car enthusiast. Classifieds work well too. <br /><br />Step 2. Find someone who has run down car they&#039;ve spent countless hours and effort fixing up - preferably that comes with some receipts from mechanics or parts places. <br /><br />Step 3. Buy the car in cash. The guy reports the sale for the min amount. <br /><br />Step 4. Sell the car on the market for closer to the actual price - Clean money from a natural value add activity - perfectly legal transaction. <br /><br />

				Selling electronic products like ebooks etc. strictly with bitcoin?<br /><br />Have some Indian guy write you a site where you can list some products or use a free wordpress theme. A book on how to make your dick bigger in 3 easy steps (DISCLAIMER: the steps have not been validated by a medical professional).<br /><br />Price per ebook is 97USD and can only be paid in bitcoin. Have a &quot;buyer&quot;(you) fill in their information when they order and produce receipts of the transaction for you and the customer when a book is bought. For every transaction you must use a proxy. You can also buy real visits for your site through various providers on the internet. Just hit some guys up at any blackhat internet marketing forum.<br /><br />This would be an easy easy way to launder anything up to 10k a month. The sales just would have to be spaced out randomly and the &quot;buyer proxy&quot; would need to be changed every time. I&#039;d buy virtual pc hosting from some proxy/VPN -company that takes bitcoin and doesn&#039;t keep any logs (they are out there) and would instal some proxy software on the pc and use fresh new daily proxies that are posted over the internet every day.<br /><br />

				iv not gone through all the responses to your question. But it all depends on how much you make. I have worked with vendors here that are in the top 1% and even they don&#039;t have a clue on how and what to do. Top 1-5% volume of cash isn&#039;t small. You would need a strategy to circulate the money with minimal loss and anonymity. Problem is people want quick quick, no it doesn&#039;t work that way. All this car wash, newsagent, is all really a beginners way to action and think. Be around the right people, you will know what you need to.

				Right - it involves paying 20% commission on what you launder and an offshore bank account. <br /><br />Guy I know used to peddle dope. His former business partner is still in the game - not by choice. He&#039;s a European guy in the US, no passport, visa expired a decade ago, smallish-time dealer. He&#039;s stranded in the US with a seven figure sum of cash under his living room floor. He&#039;s pretty paranoid, strangely enough. <br /><br />I don&#039;t get it, though. When you have that kind of money and you&#039;re careful about who you deal with (and you&#039;d have to be to amass that kind of coin), you can surely find someone reliable to help you with your particular requirements. They&#039;ll take a decent bite out of your nest egg, sure. But that beats forfeiting the lot to the feds and spending half your remaining years in a cell.

				This method is relatively common where I&#039;m from, and there&#039;s no real good way for the authorities to beat it without making the whole industry illegal:<br /><br />Advertize yourself on an escort site as a male prostitute, and buy a second phone and advertize in the paper. Put up a decent looking picture that isn&#039;t you and you&#039;ll get plenty of people contacting you. Arrange to meet them but never actually go, just so you have a long email and phone history that justifies your claims.<br /><br />Go the the health department and register yourself as a sex worker, and get the fortnightly STD check.<br /><br />Go to an accountant and explain that you&#039;re working as a prostitute, making about 3-10K a week (or more if you need to launder more) and want to pay the appropriate taxes on your income.

I expect a large chunk of escort clientele is repeat business. Obviously your guy wouldn&#039;t have any of that.<br /><br />2) well yes it is screwing someone over - the person is robbing someone of that most precious commodity; their time. If you can&#039;t see how agreeing to a transaction and then not following through (resulting in the other party wasting a bunch of time) is morally dubious, then there isn&#039;t much more to say.<br /><br />3) statements from a few non-clients won&#039;t nail you but they could help build a case against you or tip LE off that the whole escort thing is a front, meaning they investigate further.<br /><br />4) prostitution isn&#039;t legal in most parts of Australia. Depends on the state. It&#039;s generally &quot;decriminalised&quot;, meaning you&#039;re likely to have Big Brother watching over you at any given moment. Some places it&#039;s flat out illegal but there is a &#039;containment&#039; policy with a few sanctioned brothels allowed to operate - independent escorts are illegal. I don&#039;t know where you live and perhaps prostitution is totally legal where you are, but if it&#039;s not then in general I&#039;d say that using an illegal or semi-legal activity as a front for an illegal activity is perhaps not the brightest strategy. This is just an observation, not directed at you, as you say it&#039;s legal where you are. <br /><br />5) fair enough
