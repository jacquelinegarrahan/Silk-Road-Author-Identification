				Be advised don&#039;t live your whole life out on fb for many reasons. Use it for fun but keep some things to yourself. When you apply for a job, after you&#039;re out of college a few of the good of companies request social media screening (which can be worse than the drug test you know you&#039;re going to beat as you just stopped burning green 30 days ago to get a good job)<br /><br />One of my buyer&#039;s said her account was subpoena&#039;d due various pics of Molly and MDMA Pills she posted.. REALLY?&nbsp; No need for that type of silliness.<br /><br />Here&#039;s FB&#039;s policy&nbsp; &nbsp; clearnet - www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy<br /><br />&nbsp;We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.

				if you are dumb enough to talk about anything or post anything on any social media site that is in anyway incriminating or even insinuatingly portrays you as a bad person you are definitely the fool. <br /><br />Ever since the Snowden incident I realized that no matter what you do these government people will be collecting all the info on you they can, and happy to use &quot;terrorism&quot; as an excuse for them to invade countries and spy on everyone. <br /><br />

You&#039;d see the little GPS icon if it was able to turn it on. Apps can also get an accurate location if you leave wifi on.<br /><br />You should just delete or disable every facebook app from your phone and just get on facebook when you&#039;re home on the computer.

				Deleting your Facebook does not remove the data and it can still be accessed by companies who pay for access to Facebook information.&nbsp; It&#039;s pretty common nowadays. If you post something uneducated, religious, naive, vulgar, illegal, ect. then Your evaluation by employers can be greatly affected :/&nbsp; Luckily, I was told this before I even owned a Facebook... A basic rule of thumb would be to not post anything on any social media or known comformist site that you wouldn&#039;t want to come up in an interview&nbsp; ;D <br /><br />&nbsp;I knew a kid that had a Facebook solely for his own promotion.&nbsp; He posted pictures of him doing scholarly things, winning events, working out, going to church, ect.&nbsp; He also posted inspirational quotes and such while keeping out any negative information.&nbsp; It made him look like a saint.&nbsp; He ended up getting a scholarship offer from Harvard to play football.&nbsp; I have no doubt that his Facebook page was viewed AND helped.<br /><br />So you see it works both ways sometimes :)
