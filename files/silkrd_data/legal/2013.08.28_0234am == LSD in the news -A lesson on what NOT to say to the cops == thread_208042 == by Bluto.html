				Clearnet: http://www.ktvb.com/news/Police-Portland-man-found-with-LSD-at-traffic-stop-220237761.html<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Police: Portland man found with LSD at traffic stop<br /><br />by KTVB.COM<br />KTVB.COM<br />Posted on August 19, 2013 at 1:05 PM<br />Updated Tuesday, Aug 20 at 7:25 AM<br /><br />BOISE -- An Oregon man faces a felony drug charge after police say he was caught with LSD during a Saturday night traffic stop. <br /><br />Andrew Williamson, 24, of Portland allegedly had the psychedelic drug in his possession when stopped by police near South Broadway Avenue.<br /><br />Officers say they learned the 24-year-old had the drug while talking with him during the traffic stop. He was originally pulled over for speeding and failure to use turn signals, according to the Boise Police Department.<br /><br />He&#039;s now in the Ada County Jail.<br />LSD is short for lysergic acid diethylamide, and is one of the most potent and illegal hallucinogenic drugs typically found by law enforcement. Its effects include visual and auditory hallucinations, mood swings, rapid heartbeat, and sleeplessness.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So according to this news article the guy basically told the cops that he had LSD on him. Was he tripping? <br /><br />When a cop pulls me over -even if his head is made out of&nbsp; gooey marshmallow material and I am convinced that God has told me about a pending alien attack -I don&#039;t tell anyone about the tab in my pocket. <br /><br />&quot;Do you know why I pulled you over?&quot; This is the point where Mr melting marshmallow head is trying to ascertain whether he is going to give me a warning or write me a ticket.<br /><br />&quot;I&#039;m sorry, I don&#039;t feel well. I have a really bad case of diarrhea and I don&#039;t think I can hold it much longer.&quot;<br /><br />He stares at me for a second. Suddenly I can&#039;t see him anymore but I am still aware of him through my sense of smell. It&#039;s like I&#039;m seeing through smell -not through my nose necessarily but it feels like all my conscious abilities are being channeled through my ability to smell . <br /><br />He&#039;s still staring at me when he says: &quot;You missed a turn signal back there. Why don&#039;t you go home. Take care of your problem.&quot;<br /><br />You see what I did there? First of all the last thing he wants is to put me in the back of his squad car if I am going to shit all over the place. Even if it&#039;s contained in my pants -he will still have to smell it. Police generally have to maintain their cars. Plus there&#039;s the sympathy aspect -everyone has gone through a bout of diarrhea. It&#039;s not fun.<br /><br />----<br /><br />Of course, this assumes that the reason that he pulled me over was legitimate. Perhaps someone told the cop that he was carrying LSD. Cops will lie on their report and say that you consented to a search. Don&#039;t consent and for Christsakes, hide your shit better.<br /><br />

				That&#039;s pretty much a no-brainer there. Don&#039;t tell the cops you have drugs in your posession. Better yet, don&#039;t tell them anything.<br /><br />But LSD has a truth-serum quality to it (note its use for exactly that purpose in the MK ULTRA program), so I could see how if he was tripping hard, he would have spilled the beans to the cop. But damn, don&#039;t drive when you&#039;re that fucked up on LSD...

				Sounds like he may have taken having a bad trip to a whole other level. Even if he wasn&#039;t actively tripping and just had them in his possession, if he was being arrested for another reason he should&#039;ve just ate them before getting cuffed and hope that he can make bail before they kick in!

				Who knows how It went down it seems pretty vague but as someone said already the things people do never ceases to amaze me.<br />LSD certainly does have a certain mind control aspect to it, I once had a trip with an aquaintance, And thought about the aspects of it, Due to talking of conspiracys after peaking and in the really chilled out phase, My old friend was still pretty tripping and I just had to test it out. (I wasnt trying to freak him out or anything, I just had to try the mind control aspect he still does not even know probably, No harm was brought to his mental wellbeing) Anyway I started implementing things into sentences , using specific keywords that meant things etc and before you know it I had influenced the way he was thinking and he was talking of doing things I had planted if it makes sense. <br /><br />MKUltra is hilarious, If you read up on it, One of the guys they did it to ended up loving LSD so much he started the whole hippy movement, Thank you CIA.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote"> I would have hopped on my dragon and flown the fuck out of there. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br /><br />This would have been my first choice too. :D

				This really has the least amount of information a journalist could put into it, but I didn&#039;t read the website, just what the OP posted, so I may be wrong.<br />Is this really about one tab? Was he on LSD? I first thought that he was carrying like multiple blotter sheets and was wondering how they could be found. :P
