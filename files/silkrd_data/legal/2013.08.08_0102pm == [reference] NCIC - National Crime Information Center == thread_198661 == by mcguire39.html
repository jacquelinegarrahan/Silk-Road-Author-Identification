				[ Copy and paste for reference, from FBI dot gov: ]<br /><br />It’s been called the lifeline of law enforcement—an electronic clearinghouse of crime data that can be tapped into by virtually every criminal justice agency nationwide, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.<br /><br />The National Crime Information Center, or NCIC, was launched on January 27, 1967 with five files and 356,784 records. By the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2011, NCIC contained 11.7 million active records in 19 files. During FY 2011, NCIC averaged 7.9 million transactions per day.<br /><br />NCIC helps criminal justice professionals apprehend fugitives, locate missing persons, recover stolen property, and identify terrorists. It also assists law enforcement officers in performing their official duties more safely and provides them with information necessary to aid in protecting the general public.<br /><br />About the records: The NCIC database currently consists of 21 files. There are seven property files containing records of stolen articles, boats, guns, license plates, parts, securities, and vehicles. There are 14 persons files, including: Supervised Release; National Sex Offender Registry; Foreign Fugitive; Immigration Violator; Missing Person; Protection Order; Unidentified Person; U.S. Secret Service Protective; Gang; Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist; Wanted Person; Identity Theft; Violent Person; and National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Denied Transaction. The system also contains images that can be associated with NCIC records to help agencies identify people and property items. The Interstate Identification Index, which contains automated criminal history record information, is accessible through the same network as NCIC.<br /><br />How NCIC is used: Criminal justice agencies enter records into NCIC that are accessible to law enforcement agencies nationwide. For example, a law enforcement officer can search NCIC during a traffic stop to determine if the vehicle in question is stolen or if the driver is a wanted by law enforcement. The system responds instantly. However, a positive response from NCIC is not probable cause for an officer to take action. NCIC policy requires the inquiring agency to make contact with the entering agency to verify the information is accurate and up-to-date. Once the record is confirmed, the inquiring agency may take action to arrest a fugitive, return a missing person, charge a subject with violation of a protection order, or recover stolen property.<br /><br />Cooperation is key: NCIC has operated under a shared management concept between the FBI and federal, state, local, and tribal criminal justice users since its inception. There are two facets to the shared management concept—policy and functional.<br /><br />The policy facet provides a means for user input on NCIC policy through the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Advisory Policy Board. The board enables NCIC users to make recommendations to the FBI Director for policy and operational enhancements to the system. The CJIS Division actively promotes the use of the system and its benefits through daily interaction with users—whether by phone, video teleconference, or e-mail; attendance at meetings and seminars; and via the advisory process.<br /><br />The functional facet provides a means for agencies to access NCIC. The FBI provides a host computer and telecommunication lines to a single point of contact in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and Canada, as well as federal criminal justice agencies. Those jurisdictions, in turn, operate their own computer systems, providing access to nearly all local criminal justice agencies and authorized non-criminal justice agencies nationwide. The entry, modification, and removal of records are the responsibility of the agency that entered them. The CJIS Division serves as the custodian of NCIC records.<br /><br />Security and quality controls: The head of the CJIS Systems Agency—the criminal justice agency that has overall responsibility for the administration and usage of NCIC within a district, state, territory, or federal agency—appoints a CJIS systems officer (CSO) from its agency. The CSO is responsible for monitoring system use, enforcing system discipline and security, and assuring that all users follow operating procedures. NCIC policy establishes a number of security measures to ensure the privacy and integrity of the data. The information passing through the network is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. Each user of the system is authenticated to ensure proper levels of access for every transaction. To further ascertain and verify the accuracy and integrity of the data, each agency must periodically validate its records. Agencies also must undergo periodic audits to ensure data quality and adherence to all security provisions.<br /><br />For Law Enforcement: Additional information and documentation on NCIC can be found on the FBI’s Law Enforcement Online (LEO) website.<br /><br />Recent Accomplishments<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Set a new single day record on July 2, 2012, by processing more than 12.2 million NCIC transactions;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Implemented the Violent Person File to provide law enforcement officers with a warning if they approach an encountered individual who has the propensity to be violent toward law enforcement;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Implemented the NICS Denied Transaction File which contains records on individuals who have been determined to be prohibited persons according to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 and were denied as a result of a NICS background check.<br /><br />NCIC Success Story<br /><br />Recently, a special agent with the U.S. Forest Service contacted the NCIC staff at the CJIS Division for assistance with off-line searches of purged NCIC records and past transactions in connection with a significant drug trafficking investigation in the Midwest. Several crucial off-line searches connected names of individuals with specific vehicles. This connection assisted in locating and identifying suspects associated with the case, and was invaluable in following the suspects’ activities in relation to moving people, money, and products. To date, 20 people have been arrested and convicted, with more subjects identified and additional information regarding the drug trafficking organization uncovered. Approximately $1 million worth of property, illegal drugs, and contraband was seized, including marijuana, cocaine, firearms, vehicles, and cash.<br /><br />NCIC Files<br /><br />The NCIC database includes&nbsp; 21 files: seven property files and 14 person files.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Article File—Records on stolen articles and lost public safety, homeland security, and critical infrastructure identification.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Gun File—Records on stolen, lost, and recovered weapons and weapons used in the commission of crimes that are designated to expel a projectile by air, carbon dioxide, or explosive action.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Boat File—Records on stolen boats.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Securities File—Records on serially numbered stolen, embezzled, used for ransom, or counterfeit securities.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Vehicle File—Records on stolen vehicles, vehicles involved in the commission of crimes, or vehicles that may be seized based on federally issued court order.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Vehicle and Boat Parts File—Records on serially numbered stolen vehicle or boat parts.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; License Plate File—Records on stolen license plates.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Missing Persons File—Records on individuals, including children, who have been reported missing to law enforcement and there is a reasonable concern for their safety.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Foreign Fugitive File—Records on persons wanted by another country for a crime that would be a felony if it were committed in the United States.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Identity Theft File—Records containing descriptive and other information that law enforcement personnel can use to determine if an individual is a victim of identity theft of if the individual might be using a false identity.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Immigration Violator File—Records on criminal aliens whom immigration authorities have deported and aliens with outstanding administrative warrants of removal.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Protection Order File—Records on individuals against whom protection orders have been issued.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Supervised Release File—Records on individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release or released on their own recognizance or during pre-trial sentencing.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Unidentified Persons File—Records on unidentified deceased persons, living persons who are unable to verify their identities, unidentified victims of catastrophes, and recovered body parts. The file cross-references unidentified bodies against records in the Missing Persons File.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; U.S. Secret Service Protective File—Records containing names and other information on individuals who are believed to pose a threat to the U.S. president and/or others afforded protection by the U.S. Secret Service.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Gang File—Records on violent gangs and their members.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Known or Appropriately Suspected Terrorist File—Records on known or appropriately suspected terrorists in accordance with HSPD-6.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Wanted Persons File—Records on individuals (including juveniles who will be tried as adults) for whom a federal warrant or a felony or misdemeanor warrant is outstanding.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; National Sex Offender Registry File—Records on individuals who are required to register in a jurisdiction’s sex offender registry.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Denied Transaction File—Records on individuals who have been determined to be “prohibited persons” according to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and were denied as a result of a NICS background check. (As of August 2012, records include last six months of denied transactions; in the future, records will include all denials.)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Violent Person File—Once fully populated with data from our users, this file will contain records of persons with a violent criminal history and persons who have previously threatened law enforcement.<br /><br /><br /><br />When Off-Line is Better<br />Another Way to Search Crime Records<br /><br />01/04/10<br />NCIC computers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The average response time for criminal records queries to NCIC is .06 seconds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Almost six million times a day, law enforcement officers from around the country conduct online searches of our electronic repository of criminal justice records called the National Crime Information Center (NCIC). They’re looking for information and possible leads on fugitives, missing persons, terrorists, convicted sex offenders, violent gang members, stolen property, and more.<br /><br />Sometimes, though, agencies don’t have enough data for an electronic search or need additional information no longer available. So we offer another investigative tool—the off-line search—which searches information in the database a different way or looks through records no longer available on the NCIC server.<br /><br />During the past fiscal year, CJIS ran more than 22,000 off-line searches for law enforcement.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />NCIC: A Quick Rundown<br />- Initially created in 1967 to help find fugitives and stolen property.<br /><br /><br />- Over the years, additional capabilities and categories added (i.e., missing/unidentified persons, violent gangs/terrorist organizations, identity theft victims, immigration violators).<br /><br />- 11.7 million records currently in NCIC<br /><br />- Records come from FBI, other federal agencies, state/local law enforcement, authorized courts.<br /><br />- Accessed by more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies from squad cars, squad rooms, and increasingly, PDAs.<br /><br />- First year of operation, handled 2 million transactions<br /><br />- Fiscal Year 2009, handled almost 2.5 billion.<br /><br />- Averages 6.7 million transactions a day.<br /><br />- Average response time is 0.06 seconds.<br /><br />Kinds of off-line searches include:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Use of non-unique personal descriptors, like sex, height, estimated age, and hair color (these descriptors can be used in online searches but only in conjunction with other identifiers, like a person’s name and date of birth);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Partial information searches (i.e., an officer only has three or four characters of a license plate or only half of a vehicle identification number);<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Checks of purged records (records that have been removed by law enforcement or as result of varying retention schedules); and<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Searches of NCIC’s transaction logs, which may uncover other queries on the same suspect made by another law enforcement agency (can help establish a suspect’s whereabouts).<br /><br />Perhaps one of the more well-known examples of an off-line NCIC search involved Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; After identifying McVeigh as the renter of the explosives-laden Ryder truck, investigators passed us his name for all available information on him. An off-line search of NCIC’s transaction log showed that about 90 minutes after the bombing, the Oklahoma State Highway Patrol made an inquiry on McVeigh. Armed with this information, investigators contacted the highway patrol and found that McVeigh was sitting—two days after the bombing—in a nearby jail cell on unrelated weapons charges.<br /><br />A more recent example of how off-line searches can make a difference:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; On September 26, 2009, a 13-year-old girl was reported missing from Daviess County, Kentucky, and her information—including details about the convicted sex offender she was last seen with—was entered into NCIC. That night, an agent from our Louisville office, working with local authorities, contacted CJIS and requested an off-line search of the suspect’s license plate. Very quickly, we discovered that the Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, Sheriff’s Office had run a check on the license plate earlier that day (before Kentucky officials had a chance to enter the suspect’s plate number into NCIC). Officials in Wisconsin were notified, and the man was located by 4 a.m. the next day in a Wisconsin hotel. The girl was recovered safely.<br /><br />Both online and off-line NCIC searches are just another example of how we’re leveraging technology and information-sharing to track down criminals.
