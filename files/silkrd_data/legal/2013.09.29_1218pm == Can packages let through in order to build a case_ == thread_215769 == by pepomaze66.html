				So, I have around 10 orders behind me, all arrived quickly and safely besides one from cloudsurfer that never arrived (along with other people&#039;s order from that same date) - shortly before he disappeared. <br /><br />Another order I got had two filing punch holes on the side, but package untouched and unharmed.<br /><br />My question is - Is there any chance LE is letting packages through so they will have something to bust? (althu smart people will keep a clean house).<br /><br />Those two holes in the package scared me, feels like it was filed somewhere (like.. my case?)

				Letting the packages go through doesn&#039;t provide solid evidence that you knew what was in them or that you actually ordered them. It could be used to put you on a watch list in case you order some real quantity, but otherwise there isn&#039;t any reason for LE to go to all the trouble to ID your package and then just let it go. And I am pretty sure they didn&#039;t put your package in a binder for awhile and then send it on to you.

				i remember reading about the recent NY methylone ring that got busted.<br /><br />they were ordering outside of SR but still through the mail. <br />the investigation went on for over a year<br />a search warrant for their sources email account was issued as early 2012<br />the LEAs knew exactly how much was coming to where it was landing and for who.<br />they knew the tracking numbers and every email sent back and forth<br />i mean that shit was in plain text....the report didnt mention if the messages were encrypted -__-<br /><br />they just followed all of it.<br />they intercepted three specific packages on August 2013, i&#039;m not sure why.<br />probly because they had enough to stick<br /><br />i mean this doesnt say they let your packs through if customs intercept it and find contraband.<br />this does say they&#039;re willing to wait to build a case.<br />

				To answer your topic question, yes.&nbsp; In some investigations they will let packages through to build a case, just like in the street they will let you do drug deals to build a case.&nbsp; I am not saying this is what happened in your situation, but yes it is possible.<br />I suggest if you are worried, then get a new drop address?&nbsp; Seems a pretty simple way to cut off any investigation.&nbsp; And definately worth it for your peace of mind.&nbsp;

				Not my area of expertise, but from what I&#039;ve read and seen:<br />Yes, both in order to build a case on the identified recipient and in order to gather information on what the recipient does after receiving the package (contacts, activities.) <br />In other words, if you receive a package and then call people, email people, meet them in parking lots and hand them packages, mail out a bunch of stuff, transfer money around, all those things might be considered interesting and relevant and so on.<br /><br />In some cases, apparently they can do this for well over a year (as boxexpert wrote, I see), although there seems to be some spin on that and it&#039;s not mentioned in media coverage.&nbsp; [Hey, lurking or overt journalists: how about bringing that awkward question up re: the Rochester case?]<br /><br />Sorry to heighten your paranoia.<br /><br />I don&#039;t go to a lot of trials, so I am not clear on how they justify delivering the &quot;Dangerous Drugs&quot; that later become so &quot;Dangerous&quot; that it is necessary to lock the recipients/distributors up in cages. Not real clear on that logic...<br /><br /><br />

				Thanks for the replies.<br /><br />None of that happens though, I use it only for myself (and my girl).<br /><br />Ordered small amounts only, between 1-5g.
