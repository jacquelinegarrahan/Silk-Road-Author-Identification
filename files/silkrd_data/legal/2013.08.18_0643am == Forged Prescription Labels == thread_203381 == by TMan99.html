				I was wondering if these would do anything if cops were to raid your house or search your car? Would they work to get through the TSA?<br /><br />This would be for filling some sort of narcotic or something like adderall, I don&#039;t think I will use it but would like to know if it really does make you &quot;arrest proof&quot;<br /><br />If the cops come across it and suspect you of being bad in some way, couldn&#039;t they and wouldn&#039;t they just check some goverment database and see the label is fake?

				I was just wondering this earlier today myself. Ive heard of them working at airports and such.<br />I don&#039;t have the answer but i am subbing until someone hopefully does chime in with the answer.

				Forged prescriptions obviously illegal right? And you expect the cops to ignore?<br /><br />People are arrested for this kind of thing.

				Might work at a traffic stop or the TSA but during a raid it will only add charges.

				Why would the TSA give a shit? That&#039;s not really their job. Sure, if you make it easy to find drugs(have weed in a baggy, etc) they can hold you and call a real LEO, but they really aren&#039;t looking for that kind of stuff. Just package it in a tylenol bottle or something, it&#039;s not going to look suspicious. Hide it in plain site with your liquids or something. I always feel like they scrutinize it less if it&#039;s out in the open. I mean, hell, I bring the little bottles of alcohol in my carryon and they don&#039;t even look twice.
