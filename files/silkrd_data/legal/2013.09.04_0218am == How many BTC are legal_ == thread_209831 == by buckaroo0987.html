				This isn&#039;t quite as silly of a question as it sounds (hopefully).<br /><br />I&#039;m curious what the US laws are. How much BTC can you buy and sell before you&#039;re considered a &quot;Money Services Business&#039; and then have to obey all the federal regs to stay legit.

				In the US, Any persons who receive more than $10,000 in one transaction or a series of related transactions, while conducting their trade or business, must file a Form 8300. Meaning, you cannot receive $5k in one transaction, then another $5k soon after, or it could be considered related and equal $10k. Keep in mind this is cash deposits only. The form includes the buyers SSN and personal info also. So decide how you&#039;d like to proceed. $9,999 needs no reporting :/

				as well, you should look into the most recent FinCen regulations that came out, which may provide clarification on whether you need to register as a MSB, or if you qualify as just an individual utilizing bitcoins.

				March 18, 2013, FinCen came out with new guidelines on virtual currency. Here&#039;s part of the reg:<br />Definitions of User, Exchanger, and Administrator <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This guidance refers to the participants in generic virtual currency arrangements, using the terms &quot;user,&quot; &quot;exchanger,&quot; and &quot;administrator.&quot;6 A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services.7 An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency. <br /><br />Users of Virtual Currency <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN&#039;s regulations.8 Such activity, in and of itself, does not fit within the definition of &quot;money transmission services&quot; and therefore is not subject to FinCEN&#039;s registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations for MSBs.9 <br /><br />Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currency <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN&#039;s regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.10 FinCEN&#039;s regulations define the term &quot;money transmitter&quot; as a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term &quot;money transmission services&quot; means &quot;the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.&quot;11 <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies. Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA.12 FinCEN has reviewed different activities involving virtual currency and has made determinations regarding the appropriate regulatory treatment of administrators and exchangers under three scenarios: brokers and dealers of e-currencies and e-precious metals; centralized convertible virtual currencies; and de-centralized convertible virtual currencies. <br /><br />I didn&#039;t see anything about the 1k per day, but that does not mean you&#039;re wrong. I just haven&#039;t seen that in my personal research.

				That&#039;s what I just read too..<br /><br />From my understanding of it; if you buy BTC just to sell it - you&#039;re a money transmitter... no matter how much or how little you buy and sell.

				Assume an investor moves $5000 to Mt.Gox to invest in Bitcoins.&nbsp; <br />Price drops to $100, so he buys 500 Bitcoins,&nbsp; and two days later,<br />he sales them at $120 for $6000.&nbsp; <br /><br />Assuming that the person buys and sales bitcoins for next 3 months, <br />is he a Money Service Business(MSB)?&nbsp; I submit no.&nbsp; <br /><br />However, if our friend buys 500 bitcoins from Mt.Gox, and sells them to his <br />friends, then he is a MSB.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Thoughts????<br />&nbsp;

				With the new regulations that came out and will come out, you really need to figure out where you (or your &quot;friend&quot;) fall in their regulations. The most recent regs are quite vague, so you could most likely move the coins to show that you are not a MSB, however, if you&#039;re continually buying/selling, most likely you will have to register. **Note: you can register as MSB as an individual and as an institution.

				Bitcoin ATMs may need be too far off, as all you have to do is own that ATM by/under a business entity, which is registered as a MSB. Just as a company owns a website that would sell bitcoin automatically. But anyway, hopefully we&#039;ll see some bitcoin ATMs soon.<br /><br />Without the SEC regulations that define bitcoin, so much like Germany does currently, the question of reporting your capital gains and proving that you owned those exact bitcoin for more than a year, is vague in the US.<br /><br />Bitcoin is volatile, but if you are investing, you&#039;re right - it&#039;s a good investment. Meaning if you try to play the market, you could reap high benefits, but you could get burned short term. If you invest long(ish) term and use bitcoin to diversify your portfolio, that is a good idea - to me, but I&#039;m no Charles Schwab financial analyst...lol<br /><br />Lastly, Dickens, I&#039;m not 100%, but I believe you only have to pay the $100 (capital gains over the one year period).&nbsp;

The people who help you get money in and out of BTC using alternative systems then the regular exchanges.

				Bottom line, if ever get investigated, you will need to report where you got the bitcoins from, if you didn&#039;t mine them or purchase them form a an exchange. Therefore, if you are planning on &quot;generating&quot; coins, then selling, you need to be ware of the regs (if you&#039;re i the US). However, if you&#039;re planning on being a localbitcoin dealer/broker, I cannot guarantee what legal paperwork needs to be done.
