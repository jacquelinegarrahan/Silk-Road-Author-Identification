				I&#039;m facing at least 6 to 7 years in prison in USA.&nbsp; I&#039;m trying to decide to stay and do the time or leave.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have no ties or family, so no issues there.&nbsp; I have means of making money temporarily until i permanently leave the country.&nbsp; &nbsp;Out on bond now, so I&#039;ve gotta decide what to do.&nbsp; &nbsp;Advice?&nbsp; &nbsp;No passport, so I&#039;d need a fake one once I finally get ready to leave.

				Sorry to hear it man.<br /><br />As I&#039;ve said a few times here before, becoming a fugitive and fleeing the country should be your very last option.<br /><br />I know getting busted kinda puts you into shock, you think you&#039;re fucked, and your first impulse it to just get the fuck out... but try and relax.&nbsp; Is 6 or 7 years the maximum penalty if convicted?... or is this what others in jail told you?... or is this what your attorney tells you?&nbsp; You have an attorney, right?&nbsp; If not, get one immediately.&nbsp; Sometimes they can make miracles happen... and even if they don&#039;t make a miracle happen, most likely he&#039;ll be able to knock it down a class at least, or more... giving you a lesser sentence.&nbsp; Eventually, even if you&#039;re attorney hasn&#039;t destroyed the case somehow, you&#039;ll be offed a plea deal... I&#039;d say at least wait till then perhaps.&nbsp; And If the prosecutor is tired enough of dealing with your attorney, the deal may be really sweet.&nbsp; 1st time offender, you&#039;re young, you were going to school, productive member of society up until this etc.... fuck, you can possibly get work release or into some other stupid BS program.&nbsp; You&#039;d be amazed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Time wise... From what I remember, federal sentencing forces you to serve 85% of your sentence... while most states only force you to do like 50% or so.&nbsp; (maybe a bit less, maybe a bit more).&nbsp; So say you were convicted and sentenced to 6 years, most likely you&#039;d only do 3.&nbsp; Unless it&#039;s federal.<br /><br />Trials typically take a while (if you have an attorney at least)... like my trial, it went on for a year and a half, and even then my attorney could have strung it out more.&nbsp; It depends on your locale.&nbsp; My point is though, you should have some time to feel out your case... your attorney has some time to go through the evidence etc.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe the cops fucked up some paperwork etc. that you haven&#039;t noticed yet etc.&nbsp; Immediately running without even looking into this stuff is just stupid.&nbsp; &nbsp;And out of all the threads similar to this one, all of whom talked about staying connected to SR after deciding to run, I&#039;ve never seen them repost.&nbsp; <br /><br />A bit of time really isn&#039;t that difficult to do, if you have to do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#039;m sure the overwhelming consensus from people who&#039;ve never been through this, is going to be to tell you to run.&nbsp; It&#039;s like everyone thinks it&#039;s easy, like life is a movie or something.&nbsp; &nbsp;But it&#039;s not.&nbsp; The slightest slip up, random occurrence, accident, or whatever, will fuck you.&nbsp; Well, unless you&#039;re from/in some country that doesn&#039;t extradite to the US of course.&nbsp; &nbsp;And if you run, we&#039;ll be smart about it... plan and research.<br /><br />Couple examples of what I&#039;ve seen:&nbsp; <br />I seen a guy get off a murder conviction with 6 months time already served, due to paperwork error... smiling from ear to ear right at the victim&#039;s family/judge.&nbsp; In my first stop in prison, where I was waiting for my prison assignment... like which prison you&#039;ll ultimately be going to... there was a dude in there, he raped and killed two members of the same family (according to the CO&#039;s)... dude only got like a year for some fucked up reason that idk.&nbsp; Shit&#039;s crazy, man.<br /><br />Stay positive... it&#039;s not going to help if you go all fatalist and such.<br />

				I don&#039;t know what to say here. Fleeing gives me all kinds of bad feelings, and going in does too - though less so, since there&#039;s a light at the end of the tunnel there. <br /><br />In one sense, going in is taking a certain route, where you will eventually be back on the outside doing whatever you&#039;ll be doing, though as mentioned before likely without a great job. Unless you&#039;re selling drugs or something. ;)<br /><br />Anyway, if you&#039;re looking to weigh the community vote, put me down for NOT fleeing. Because since you&#039;re still considering one way or another, that tells me that you haven&#039;t had the time or need to plan for this exact situation, where you&#039;d need to be able to escape the country unseen, and stay off the grid in another country that speaks your language, and preferably that won&#039;t extradite you if/when found. Putting together a hasty plan and having it backfire could be the single worst thing you could do here.<br /><br />Of course, take this with a grain of salt, as always. I&#039;m simply giving what I believe to be the most rational and practical thoughts on this situation with the information provided. Going in, there are always chances that as mentioned, your time served could be shortened by some technicality or something. If you flee, it&#039;s all or nothing, and no flexibility.<br /><br />Best of luck to you in any and all decisions you make from here on out.

				If you have six years to do, rather than 10 or 20, I&#039;d just serve the time.&nbsp; Leaving should only be seriously considered if you&#039;ve had a plan in place long before you got caught. Trying to acquire a decent identity and trying to cross borders, or travel at all, will be much harder if not impossible to get away with if you&#039;re trying to set it all up AFTER you&#039;re already in trouble.

				6.5 years in minimum security vs a lifetime on the run with the possibility of being caught and doing even more time constantly hanging over your head. I think doing the time is the hard but wise choice.

Find a good man while in prison, it will help with the time...sucking cock is not so bad once you get used to it.&nbsp; plus you can get straight, maybe study for a degree.&nbsp; <br /><br />if you run you will never rest. always looking to see who is watching you.

				It&#039;s hard to say what to. Your the one that has to do the time so only you can decide what to do. <br /><br />You haven&#039;t been convicted yet so when you get out on bail you may want to let the trial play out a bit longer. Once you run you will have foreclosed any other options. <br /><br />If you run can you survive? Another thing to consider is how hard will they look for you? Will they pay the cost of extradition if you do get caught? If caught you could well face additional charges which can carry a stiffer penalty. <br /><br />Of course staying means you will go to prison. From what you are saying you will do some time in prison even if it is not 6 years. IDK what minimum security prisons are like where you are. <br /><br />Depending on a variety of factors you could well have a productive life after prison. <br /><br />There are points either way and you are the one that has to do the time or live on the run. I don&#039;t know what I would do in your place.<br /><br />I honestly don&#039;t believe a a word in this thread but figured I would give my 2 cents anyway. <br /><br />If true I hope things work out for the best.

				I feel for ya. I have determined 5 years to be my tolerance cutoff. Less than that I&#039;m doing, more then that I don&#039;t think so. In the grand scheme of things 7 years really is not that long, on the other hand life is really short. I think your state matters. Prison experience from state to state differ greatly. Some aren&#039;t too bad, others are outright awful (ie Cali). Feds are awesome (as far as prison goes) but you&#039;ve already said it&#039;s state.

				Do the time, friend, you would be running forever, and never get away.&nbsp; Without people to help hide and protect you should you make it to a few potential destinations, no six figure rainy day fund will last you two years running...&nbsp; Hide money, save money, use the time, don&#039;t let the time use you.

				Hey if you do decide to run make sure you ask your lawyer which is better to have open-ended, a binding plea or a trail date. If you have already plead it might be worth your time to file a motion to remove your plea in order to get a trail date that way if 15 years from now you do get caught then instead of automatically getting the 7 years you might just be back to square one and be dealing with less of an asshole of a prosecutor or their evidence or witnesses may be long gone.

The problem is even if the case got tossed there are still charges for skipping bond which can be just as harsh. <br /><br />Like I said the state may not look too hard for you. Are you paying the bail yourself in full. If you use a bail bond you can be sure they will look for you. <br />I understand feeling beat down.

				If you do the time keep in mind that given your length of time you will want to make friends for the sake of your sanity and safety but never forget that they are all fucking idiots and that they are just fake friends. One of the saddest things about prison is looking around and saying to yourself that each and every one of these retarded idiots belong there. It&#039;s hard to have extreme contempt for the justice system when every single person is a retard who belongs locked up just because they are too retarded too belong in society. They might not deserve to be locked up 20 years for a joint of weed, but rest assured none are people you really want to associate with by choice due to their questionably working brains.

				Really man? 6.5 years is pretty much a nickel on the dollar. If youre using &quot;dude&quot; in your speech, you are in your 20s or 30s. You still have 50+ years left on your life. You are going to be locked up for 6.5, or RUNNING for 50+. Unless you have the same guy Saul Goodman has to change your identity, this is a no brainer.&nbsp; Put those numbers in front of you by themselves for a second.<br /><br />6.5 years in minimum secuirty prision<br /><br />OR<br /><br />50+ years RUNNING<br /><br />if you DO run, youre probably going to be just doing illegal shit in another country anyway. Do you really think youre going to be able to live a legitimate life, obtain a college education, and find a white collar desk job after all that? Unless you know Politicians in other countries, youre going to be the exact same thing as the illegal Mexicans are to us Americans. You&#039;ll be living in poverty, in hiding, selling drugs, laying low for the rest of your life.&nbsp; Youll be in that gang of illegal Americans in some European country that the cops are always trying to bust their illegal prostitution operation. Just do the time man. Ask anyone in jail about going to prison. They all bitch about how they cant wait to gtfo of county jail so they can be in prison because its much closer to normal life. And minimum security? cmon man, that probably means conjugal visits! LOL, fuck yeah!

				there going to catch you somtime in the future and its going to be a lot worse when they do.<br />if you have the money you can live good in prison, if its county time run as fast as you can.<br />it really depends on the state, a lot can happen in 6.5 years. laws change and states go broke and will need to rethink there practice of locking people up for nothing.<br />anything can happen.<br />you really want to leave your life and you have a good chance of getting caught in the first 5 years and being in a worse position like 6.5 in max lockdown.<br />i have done enough time to have experience in this, if your going to run get the best headstart you can and go. dont tell anybody, just get the longest extension for court like a medical reason and go.<br />did you get caught because of sr or just caught and had stuff from here?

Surely the police could run all that info through a computer and with that facial recognition system they use on photos they&#039;d have your criminal record up on the screen, along with a fairly good case to the courts for proving you&#039;re planning to jump bail in about 5 minutes flat.

Once your there I&#039;d scrap all your American ID, burn your fingerprints off if they don&#039;t have your DNA on record and start a bank account and get further identifying documents using your passport in the Dominican Republic.<br /><br />Once you&#039;ve done that travel to a country where you want to settle down, find a job and and apply for residency/citizenship using your Dominican Republic identity. If you can succeed at doing this you&#039;ll have a clean slate &amp; new identity and should be safe from the law.<br /><br />Here&#039;s the vendor:<br />http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/user/9f28dd069b<br /><br />Sounds like a lot to go through but I&#039;d just see it as a big adventure that is 10x more fun than sitting in a jail.<br /><br />Worst comes worse it&#039;ll make an awesome book you can write about your life if they catch you eventually.<br /><br />Whatever you do man, good luck, and fuck the police.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />Not to be a dick, Aussiemitch, but 10 grand for a passport but with NO feedback on the listing? I&#039;d be really wary of that one, could be a honeytrap from LE wanting to nab potential people wanting to go on the run red-handed, no? <br /><br />They want: 1) your approximate age 2) Natural Hair Color, 4) Natural Eye Color 5) Height and 6) Weight 7) Country you are from plus your current address and a recent photograph. Surely the police could run all that info through a computer and with that facial recognition system they use on photos they&#039;d have your criminal record up on the screen, along with a fairly good case to the courts for proving you&#039;re planning to jump bail in about 5 minutes flat. Especially as they want 10K, there&#039;s no way you can claim it was a joke/ novelty passport. <br /><br />IF it&#039;s legit then I apologize, but I&#039;d be wary of buying that myself. Quite apart from the fact that if it&#039;s not LE then it&#039;s quite likely a scam as it takes 45 days to get to you and, as he&#039;s dealing in full escrow, it&#039;ll auto-finalize after 17 days.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I completely agree with you that I wouldn&#039;t want to be the first person to buy it, however if I was facing 6.5 years in prison i&#039;d be willing to give it a shot as they do let you do the whole thing in escrow. You can always go into resolution center and extend the escrow to up to 99 days!

He could get out of prison and go to tech school and be able to make 50k as a plumber or electrician or some shit. small companies like that dont waste their time on background checks. Even being a bartender at a nice ass bar you can make at least $30k a year working 3 days a week. I had a manager that told me he made $70k a year bartending 6 nights a week.<br /><br />Fuck running.

				I have seen this before and everyone I know who ran, regretted it later. You forfeit the bond, which sounds substantial, and you are a fugitive for the rest of your life, which I am going to guess is longer than 6-7 years. Doing time sucks (I only did a year) but there is parole if you keep quiet and just do your time. I can&#039;t tell you what to do, but if it was me (knowing what I know now) I would do the time and be done with it. And I&#039;m kinda old so 6-7 would be harder but I would do it. Running, for me, would just add more problems to an already bad situation. Best of luck guy and whatever you do I hope it works out for you.
