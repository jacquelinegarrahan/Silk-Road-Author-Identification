				Hello!<br /><br />I&#039;m not gonna go into any detail as to my whereabouts or anything like that. I&#039;m thinking theoretically here.<br /><br />What if I was to order a bulk amount of, lets say, Substance-D, and it got intercepted. Now, as I am a diligent drug dealer, I have _everything_ clean. Nothing on my comps, nothing in the house. Not one suspicious google search, SMS or phone call, nothing to do with BTC. No suspicious cash or bank action. Nothing.<br /><br />Would I still be in the clear when just denying knowing anything about the intercepted order? Now, this would probably be very easy if I only had ordered a personal amount of this Substance-D. Law Enforcement would most likely drop the case quickly, but what do you guys think would happen with a large bulk order in similar conditions? I fear they would push on, trying to make me crack. Keep me locked up for as long as they can, harass my family and friends, and ask around at the company I work for. Seize my computers and other possession. And I would just deny everything.<br /><br />?

				All these &quot;plausibly deniability&quot; stories get on my nerves.&nbsp; It&#039;s not like your parents caught you doing something and you have to talk your way out of being grounded!&nbsp; <br /><br />The ONLY real issues, assuming the shipment has been intercepted and identified as contraband, are:<br /><br />a) is the shipment worth investigating in the first place? <br /><br />b) if yes to a, do they have enough evidence for a warrant? <br /><br />c) if a and b, do they have enough evidence for an arrest?<br /><br />d) if abc, do they have enough evidence to prove a case, despite your lawyer working against them?&nbsp; (this is the ONLY place where some of the stuff that is similar to plausible deniability comes in, but not in the same way as most people describe it).&nbsp; <br /><br />e) finally, what kind of charges can they make stick?<br /><br />So if everything else in your op really is clean, I&#039;d say the only difference between smaller and bulk shipments is A: more likely to get an investigation going.&nbsp; <br /><br />That, and maybe e: if it does come to trial you will be more likely to face, and be convicted of if they prove the pkg is yours, a more serious charge than if the shipment is small enough to possibly look like personal use.&nbsp; <br /><br />Personal use isn&#039;t always everything below a gram.&nbsp; AFAIK it can sometimes be successfully argued with slightly bigger shipments as &quot;stocking up&quot;, as long as there is ZERO evidence otherwise that shows selling (no baggies, pay owe sheets, scale).&nbsp; But what counts for bulk on this site is probably to much to make that cut if you were caught and convicted with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, not every interception results in a CD or tossing the evidence.&nbsp; They do sometimes weight it and then send it on, and let you accumulate a few shipments to fuck you more later.&nbsp; So keep that in mind: the whole &quot;just dont sign for anything and you&#039;ll prove its not yours&quot; is a red herring: the system is definitely changing in response to SR.&nbsp; <br />
