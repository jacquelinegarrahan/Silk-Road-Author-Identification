				Smuggling large amounts into burning man in a week. Acid, mollie, DMT, mushrooms. Everything. Curious if anyone has done this before. Coming from LA. Any tips? I know dogs can&#039;t smell mushrooms or acid, and will be vaccum sealing the mol and DMT, as well as stashing in a clever manner. Anything helps, even positive words or success stories. Just a bit nervous. Much love.<br />~DFG~

				We&#039;ve gone for several years and never had any troubles with LEOs. Just make sure you obey all traffic laws, don&#039;t give any reasons to be pulled over and you will be fine. Always keep any substances in your trunk and NEVER consent to searches (except to the BM staff who are only searching to make sure you aren&#039;t sneaking in other humans).&nbsp; As long as I have been going (this will be my 5th year) there has been no police or dogs at the gate. They do patrol around the streets and especially around sound camps, but as long as you are not using anything in the open you should be fine.&nbsp; If you can help it, try to not have any drugs on you on the way out, the police are usually out in full force trying to write every last ticket they can before the city clears out. If you do get caught with weed you&#039;ll probably just get a ticket, the Nevada ACLU has a camp at BM and can help out if you end up needing to fight a minor ticket for herb or other bullshit charges like &#039;disorderly conduct&#039;.<br /><br />Also, just a general word of caution, remember that you&#039;re in a seriously harsh environment on the playa. Drink lots of water and avoid alcohol like the plague while on other substances. If you OD or hurt yourself doing something stupid, the nearest hospital is a very expensive helicopter ride away.

				Just wanted to say have a great time!&nbsp; You&#039;ll be fine.&nbsp; Benzos can work well for occasions like this.&nbsp; Just a little bit if you do end up getting a bit freaked by driving around with all that gear.&nbsp; Once you get off the interstate you&#039;ll be so relieved.

				Altoid tins make great ash trays.&nbsp; But you don&#039;t have to hide your drugs in one.&nbsp; Your vehicle will be searched at the gate, but read the FAQ&#039;s: &quot;We aren&#039;t looking for your stash.&quot;&nbsp; If you gave the dude a roll he would probably kiss you on the lips.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are&nbsp; a lot of LE at BM, they are welcomed and BM staff are in radio communication with them.&nbsp; This is good, it&#039;s a big town and emergencies do happen from time to time.&nbsp; They will bust people for obviously using drugs.&nbsp; The most common drug bust is for smoking weed.&nbsp; They just follow the smell.&nbsp; They do not hassle you for running around out of your mind on hallucinogens.&nbsp; <br /><br />My advice is to just be discreet.&nbsp; Don&#039;t have any drugs out in plain sight.&nbsp; Drop in privacy and you should be fine.&nbsp; <br /><br />Speaking of which, nobody walks from camp to camp begging for drugs.&nbsp; Ignore this behavior and for pete&#039;s sake don&#039;t give anybody drugs just cuz they asked for them.&nbsp; Unless it&#039;s some ultra-hot naked chick, of course.&nbsp; Then it&#039;s OK.&nbsp;

				Wow, a festival you can&#039;t smoke pot openly in?<br /><br />I guess I am spoiled in BC. At our outdoor festivals there is open drug use all around. At Soundwave for example I only saw a cop once and it was to kick out some underage kids that were getting fucked up on booze.<br />

				Yes, careful smoking!&nbsp; They will come into your camp and search it if they smell it walking by I&#039;ve heard!&nbsp; I&#039;ve personally seen a number of people with tickets for smoking it and heard of at least a couple of camp searches.
