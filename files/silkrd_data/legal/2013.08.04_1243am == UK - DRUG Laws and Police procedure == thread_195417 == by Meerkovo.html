				&nbsp; &nbsp;I invite all the people from our great nation to post and share with the community and experiences you may have had in court or with police and the outcome. Our laws go in hand in hand with a good amount of EU countries so possibly EU members could contribute to this thread also. I have done my fair share of law study in my life the hard way and the paranoia way :)<br /><br />Meerkovo

				My experience of UK drugs laws are pretty extensive, and a couple of simple rules can make a world of difference to the outcome.<br />Rule number one is obvious, ADMIT NOTHING! you&#039;d be amazed at how many cases would fall apart if people just kept their mouths shut. I&#039;ve seen cases where the police have had enough evidence to crucify someone but simple errors on their part and no comment from the arrested person has resulted in charges being reduced or thrown out altogether.<br />Rule number two is DON&#039;T USE A DUTY SOLICITOR!&nbsp; it&#039;s often the only option an arrested person has when they&#039;re busted but it&#039;s nearly always a bad move. If you don&#039;t know an experienced drug solicitor it&#039;s a good idea to carry the number of the Release Helpline - 0845 4500 215 they will give you a list of decent solicitors in your area. If you have to use the Duty Solicitor then just use him to contact Release for you and get you the list of &quot;approved&quot; solicitors. Duty Solicitors spend a lot of time at the Police Station and they are very often good friends with the custody officer etc, this relationship rarely benefits the accused.<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen cases where evidence numbers have been mixed up more than once, in one case the accused had admitted his guilt thinking he was caught red handed so he went to jail but in the other case the accused had kept silent and they had to drop all the charges.<br />I&#039;ve also seen a clever solicitor talk down a case where a poor Hippy had been caught with a recently harvested crop. He pointed out that the definition of Herbal Cannabis in the Misuse of Drugs Act is &quot;The flowering tops and fruiting bodies&quot; of the cannabis plant, he succesfully argued that this doesn&#039;t include stems, leaf and seeds and because a handful of plants were still hanging he also claimed the original weight captured was &quot;wet weight&quot; and the dry weight would be just 15% of that, in this case the evidence had already been forensically identified and videoed etc and then destroyed after an earlier hearing, so the prosecution couldn&#039;t produce it in court to refute the details and the poor hippy walked out of court with a fine :)<br /><br />So shut up, get a good brief and sit back and let the police and prosecution make their mistakes :)

				+1 to keeping your mouth closed. So, so many cases only happen because people confess. Fuck that.<br /><br />However, it&#039;s worth noting even&nbsp; normal interrogation is hugely overwhelming. The IRA paramilitary training is to not look at your interrogators, to find a fixed point on a wall behind them, and to stare at it and to concentrate staring at it.<br /><br />Do NOT get involved in banter or conversation. They are MUCH more experienced than you.<br /><br />

				Go to go along with that O,P. Always not guilty, no exeptions, a case can fuck up a lot of ways, what makes me chuckle is the &quot; no comment guv&quot; you don&#039;t even say that. Just keep your grid shut from start to finish. They can even gauge your guilt or innocence by your voice, Psychoanalysis, so saying &quot;no comment &quot; can get you convicted. Keep it zipped.

Before that time is up the police should either give you a trial date or extend your bail. It doesn&#039;t sound like any of this has happened with you so i suspect you were arrested on suspicion of importing a controlled substance but they didn&#039;t carry it through to prosecution.

				I find it all scary and confusing, pretty certain i was charged tho.<br /><br />Brief summary of what happened; they turned up with a search warrent which i still have a copy of, and i spend the day in the cell as they searched my abode, they then interviewed me, brought out the package in question (smelt fantastic), later during interview i signed a sheet of paper with the misc evidence described/bagged they had gathered from my property and at the end of the interview they formally read out a charge sheet something like &quot;we charge&nbsp; mr/mrs bla that on&nbsp; a certain date for importation of a controlled bla from bla bla&quot; - from what i remember. I have no copies of anything they gave me when i left the cells i was so screwed up i managed to loose the paperwork in the wash.<br /><br />I do remember being told by one of them that it will take a long time before you hear anything, but from previous scrapes usually month 11 you get the letter with a court date for a few weeks later, this is my experience from the couple of previous times ive been in trouble in the past with minor offences.<br /><br />I dont want to say any more publically, but happy to discuss a little further by pm PlutoPete if you think you can maybe help, thanks for your time
