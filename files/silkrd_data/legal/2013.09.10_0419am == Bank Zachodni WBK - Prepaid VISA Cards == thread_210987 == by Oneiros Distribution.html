What would be the penalty for being caught with/using one of these cards?

				You can use them without registering them.<br />They do not flag any activity.<br />They are usually a hassle waiting for an exchange to make the SEPA transfer, and finding exchanges that will let you anonymously make SEPA transfers.

				ATM without cctv are at every gas station in america.<br /><br />3500 USD is the usd limit<br /><br />It is better to have multiple cards and keep track of the amounts and deposits on a speadsheet, easy.<br />It is better to do two separate $500 deposits across multiple cards than a $1000 to one card, as you get more volume, you will find yourself sending 1k to every card all the time, this raises eyebrows from your exchange your withdrawing from.

				Hello<br /><br />I will try to answer your questions:<br /><br />A) Is it possible to register more than one card Per Person and what are the Terms set by the Bank on this matter?<br /><br />Its possible but if one card get flagged for suspicious behaviour all cards might get frozen.<br /><br />B) Are there any known cases of these cards being shutdown and if so, why?<br /><br />No, i havent encountered a blocked card(besides 3months block caused by double withdrawing around midnight).<br /><br />C) When withdrawing Money from the Cards one can see by logging in very specifically what ATM has been used down to a very narrow geographic location - does it have any relevance if one uses the exact same ATM for multiple different Cards? Ie. is there any risk Bank Zachodni WBK would flag Cards as suspicious if they see different people start withdrawing money from the exact same ATM in a very short time span?<br /><br />Theres always risk but for now no one seems to check that matter and it works well .<br /><br /><br />D) Is there any Information if this Type of Service might eventually Expire in the Future or is nothing known about this?<br /><br />Poland is bound to USA and its possible that one day strict policies like in USA will come here to Poland and those cards wont be so easy to aquire anonymously.<br /><br />E) Is there any way for a Bitcoin Exchange to verify the details used for Registering the Account? Ie. can they cross-reference the Name used on an Exchange with the one used for a specific IBAN?<br /><br />Withdraw from bitcoin exchange will only go through if all data matches (banks and exchanges:name address...).<br /><br />F) Is there any Information regarding their Policy of Freezing Accounts? I&#039;ve seen it mentioned they can Freeze the Account for three months if one attempts to withdraw twice near midnight, anything other than this?<br /><br /><br />No, nothing that i know of.<br /><br /><br />Cheers,<br />BioCanna<br />

				butch1200 is a known scammer.&nbsp; Search for his name in the forum.&nbsp; He scammed people on orders and then disappeared.&nbsp; He empties out the WBK card account as soon as you load it.&nbsp; If he&#039;s back selling on here, admin should be alerted.

				I&#039;m curious to know how these cards are loaded from BTC. Must one link it to an exchange account? If so, then it would be necessary to obtain an anonymous verified exchange account.<br /><br />Are there other ways to load these?<br /><br />SS

				First I&#039;ll post what DrugsAndCash and everythingman answered me:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: DrugsAndCash</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">A) First of all you don&#039;t have to register this cards but yes of course for 1 identity you can register 10 cards maximum. But registration is useless and just wasting time.<br />B) Yes I&#039;m victim of case you described. Card has been blocked due to many small transactions from different people as loadings so bank flagged it as card used to receive business payments what is strictly prohibited.<br />C. This can&#039;t be the reason for flagging or blocking card. Flagging or blocking card is caused only by discovering by bank that card is funded from illegal money like funds from paypal scams or stolen from another bank account.<br />D. It won&#039;t expire till goverment won&#039;t change law so I think it will always exist.<br />E. I can help you in this point by giving you exchanger which doesn&#039;t require verification.<br />F. Instant withdrawals after midnight can be the reason of freezing card so we don&#039;t recommend it but you can decrease this risk by doing some payments in stores using card.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />DAC</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote from: everythingman</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Hi<br />its very good topic.<br />thanks<br /><br />a - yes you can but what ? its anonimity card so you register it on fake data<br />b - yes if you exceed a limit and if the bank have a suspicion to money laundering ( but its unlikely if you dont register few cards on the same name ;) )<br />c - low risk because you can withdraw about 150 -200 cash daily and the most step in this is never show you face on ATM camera. This card is to withdraw cash in short time - its to holiday expenses<br />d- i haven&#039;t any information but i monitoring situation ;)<br />e -No they not verify you should find exchange which don&#039;t interesting IBAN they clientc like btc-e , bitcurex itp<br />f - yes if you withdraw on 23;55 you can cash out next on 00;02 cus its new day and its suspicion for him. i think that its only my word<br /><br />I used it for long time and cash out 500 pln every day. if i withdraw about 9 k ( i have in pln limit 10 k ) i change a card and register new on new data and all work fine. ;)<br /><br />cheers</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />With all the answers so far I&#039;ve learned a couple of surprising things. The first and most important is Registration of the Card itself is apparently not needed whatsoever, and only reason to do it is basically to be able to keep track at any time how much Money is Present on them ( however worth keeping in mind is the PIN Code can be changed to a Custom One when registering online ). Seeing as this major obstacle is removed the secondary concern is freezing as they seem to have a Policy of Freezing Accounts if they get too many Transactions from Various Accounts as I&#039;ve understood it. I have to assume this would only be in very small Amounts and a considerable large Amount of Transactions as one could reach the Quota per Year per card within roughly 16 days if one withdraws the max amount every day possible. Now on to the final point, Bitcoin Exchanges:<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen a couple mention the name on the Bitcoin Exchange Account and the name of the Bank Account has to match up, but I suppose this is a moot point if one hasn&#039;t registered a name on the Card at all as it would be impossible to verify this? How about if you actually have a Verified Account, will they at some point wonder why one is withdrawing into so many different Accounts? By the way, is anyone familiar with a Polish Bitcoin Exchange which has the ability to deposit money &quot;Domestically&quot; and thus make the money arrive significantly faster and more consistently in comparison to SEPA transfers?<br /><br />My plan is to write a comprehensive Guide with all the Information available which is deemed to be worth knowing to effectively utilize these Cards, although it seems the scope of this Guide might be much smaller as it turns out the the Key Point of registering the card online wasn&#039;t even needed. :P<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210987.msg1530799#msg1530799">Quote from: Northwest Nuggets on September 11, 2013, 07:41 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">butch1200 is a known scammer.&nbsp; Search for his name in the forum.&nbsp; He scammed people on orders and then disappeared.&nbsp; He empties out the WBK card account as soon as you load it.&nbsp; If he&#039;s back selling on here, admin should be alerted.<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I was not able to find any proof of this whatsoever by searching, although I did find a couple of claims basically naming every single Vendor on Silk Road being scammers - in conclusion either it&#039;s safe to use the cards or every single one is scamming. However you might still have a hypothetical point, so I will take some pictures on how the package is supposed to look like and include them in a future post. :)

				I get the card from butch and feel funny how the envelope is sealed. I think it could have been open, card detail copies and then seal again. It is a standard envelope like how you mail to someone a letter. I think in this situation with steam it can be open up because there is no security seal. And in mine there was a sort of wrinkle pattern all along the sealing.<br /><br />But I dismiss this as paranoid and load 400 euro in the card and spend it in the stores like to buy a packet of cigarettes, a baguette, and so forth. After a short time the card is drained of 200 euro and 5 euro remain in the account.

Some interesting quotes from the thread:<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">On 8/15 $1000 USD disappeared from a prepaid debit card that I purchased from butch1200 and I haven&#039;t been able to call the bank about it yet, because it&#039;s the weekend in Poland.<br /><br />My advice to users of these cards who want to avoid this situation is only load what you intend to withdraw within 24 hours.<br /><br />EDIT: seller is talking with me. Will change or remove this post if the issue gets resolved.<br /><br />EDIT 8/18: seller offered steps to reclaim the lost funds. Apparently this issue is due to the card being unregistered online, so much for anonymous instant debit account. will update soon</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />The last part is especially interesting, as the theory could be someone is scimming these cards before sending them out and then attempt to withdraw money from them at random times. As I mentioned before if one registers the card online one has the opportunity to change the PIN, so the primary question here is simply is the &quot;scam&quot; done purely through ATMs or is the Money simply sent away to another Account? It&#039;s unfortunate all descriptions on the scam are extremely vague so it&#039;s impossible to tell which.&nbsp; :(<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The cards should be safe since they come sealed however even the polish know that shady money is passing through these cards. Since Poland isn&#039;t the richest country on the would it could be one of the workers just stealing cash because they know you won&#039;t go to the police.<br /><br />These cards are intended for small amounts of money on a holiday or whatever not for constant G&#039;s being withdrawn and such.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />So while I don&#039;t doubt there are scammers with these Cards the problematic bit are the worthless explanations by all parties involved so far, it would with some proper Description to be easy to tell how the Scam worked exactly but without that we&#039;re down to wild accusations and theories. What can be said for sure so far appears to be the the longer the Period the Money sits on the Card, the Greater the Risk.<br />----------<br />Edit: For anyone getting scammed try to include this Crucial Information next time:<br /><br />* Can you remember if the Letter looked opened or not when getting it?<br />* What type of Card was it, ie. USD, EUR, or GPB?<br />* Was the Card registered Online ( ie. did you change the PIN ) ?<br />* What did the Information say online about where the Money went ( they have VERY specific Information available if it&#039;s through ATM ) ?<br />* At what exact time/date did the Money disappear, when was money Deposited into the Account?<br /><br />What Vendor it is does not matter much as this sounds like a possible Systematic Error, and to get to the bottom of this one we must be able to tell if it&#039;s a Scam just from an Appearance or Technical Point of View or it can never be solved probably.

				Also another thing to think about is that with these cards you are doing a SEPA transfer to the card. SEPA is only for the euro so if you get a USD card, how does this work? If you are in the US and want dollars must you load the card with euros then convert to USD at the atm? If so that is an extra fee, per withdrawal!<br /><br />Would love to hear more on this.<br /><br />SS

				so far the only way i have found to transfer funds onto the cards is through SR bank transfers and so far the only people i see that do it charges a 10% fee.... with the withdrawal limit at $200, $3 atm fee, and i&#039;m not sure if there is a 2% euro conversion fee... these cards are not really worth it...

Supposedly BTC-E doesn&#039;t require Identification but in return takes a higher percentage in commission, so if one is planning on moving large amounts of funds Fake IDs pay off in the long run. If one wants to take it semi-seriously with Dedicated IP Addresses refer to the following post: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=177551.msg1535342#msg1535342<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210987.msg1550188#msg1550188">Quote from: echo_ on September 20, 2013, 04:25 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How hot are these cards?<br /><br />For example if you wanted to just get one in your real name and use it normally.

As have been mentioned before the cards actually work without a name registered to them, but if you register online you get to switch the PIN number and get access to the cards full history online ( not sure if this is retroactive or not though ). I see now it hasn&#039;t been mentioned clearly anywhere but just go to http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/advanced.php and pick Polish/Poland and use the information provided from that. Either use TOR with a localized Polish IP Number or refer to my answer above and get a Dedicated Polish IP Address.<br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=210987.msg1558625#msg1558625">Quote from: Fajbusiewicz on September 23, 2013, 04:28 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=214296.0<br /></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br />I&#039;ve added you to the original post in this thread, but it&#039;s starting to get a bit crowded with Vendors offering the exact same Product. A suggestion might be to include more information or provide some Service making you different from the other Vendors as most are quite established by now.<br />----------<br />I&#039;ve received my latest batch of EUR Cards very recently and I&#039;ve decided to scan the contents of the Letter and it&#039;s contents so anyone wondering can get a good look of how they look like, I&#039;m surprised no Vendor has done this yet to my knowledge. I&#039;ve censored certain parts with green color with a black border around each such part.<br /><br />The Letter dimensions are width 22.80 cm and height 11.30 cm, it weighs between 28.60 to 28.80 grams. A scan of the Front/back respectively of the Letter: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/Kwqm.jpg / http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/F2MO.jpg - The handwritten &quot;EU&quot; at the left side is from the Vendor who probably does it to keep track of the type. This is how the Letter looks ripped opened on the inside: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/jQPU.jpg<br /><br />First Page Front/Back: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/2NJd.jpg / http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/dDDY.jpg<br />Second Page Front/Back: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/Dh9D.jpg / http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/vaz2.jpg [ Rotated Clockwise 90 Degrees ]<br />Third Page Front/Back [Sealed]: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/fl4f.jpg / http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/5eWi.jpg [ Rotated Clockwise 90 Degrees ]<br />Third Page Opened: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/S0Zm.jpg [ Rotated Clockwise 90 Degrees ]<br /><br />In some upcoming posts I&#039;ll create a guide for how to Register these Cards online and whatever else I might have forgotten to mention. :)

There&#039;s no known way for Bitstamp to investigate if the Polish Cards are registered in the same name as the Bitstamp Account to my knowledge and thus they would not deny it unless they have some secret criteria if it for example looks suspicious, ie. if one attempts to withdraw to 8+ different Cards or something to that effect. Worst case scenario would be they deny the transfer and one is forced to buy the Bitcoins back and do it with some other method instead, but this hasn&#039;t happened to me personally yet so at least for now I know of no issues.<br />----------<br />A Guide on how to register a &quot;Bank Zachodni WBK - Prepaid VISA Card&quot; online:<br /><br />Start by going to http://www.fakenamegenerator.com/advanced.php - go to &quot;Name set&quot; and pick Polish, then &quot;Country&quot; and pick Poland. Click generate and take note of the following fields: Name/Address ( Top Three Rows), Phone and PESEL. Depending on how advanced one wants to be it would be advisable to use a location where the Polish IP resides, but this is only for those overly cautious and might not even matter in the end. After you&#039;ve noted this information go to https://www.centrum24.pl/prepaid/index?index=1491 and click on Rejestracja ( Register ).<br /><br />Stage 1/4 Dane użytkownika ( User Data ): You will now be presented with the following screen/image: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/OhVb.png<br /><br />Rodzaj karty ( Card Type; The type of Card you&#039;re registering, pick &quot;Karta prepaid&quot;. )<br />Login ( E-mail Login; What e-mail you intend to use for receiving E-Mail from the Bank. )<br />Hasło ( Password; What password you&#039;re going to use, keep in mind the password can only be 8-20 characters and has several restrictions - it will also have to be changed later if you intend to actually login. )<br />Potwierdź hasło ( Confirm Password; Just the same password you&#039;ve written in Hasło/Password. )<br />PESEL ( Universal Electronic System for Registration of the Population; Polish National Identification Number, is located in the PESEL Field from fakenamegenerator. )<br />Telefon komórkowy ( Phone Number; Located in the Phone Field from fakenamegenerator, also keep in mind to set the Area so it corresponds with the number. )<br />Imię ( First Name; First name, is located in the Address Field from from fakenamegenerator. )<br />Nazwisko ( Surname; Last name, is located in the Address Field from from fakenamegenerator. )<br />Ulica ( Street; The main Address Line, is located in the Address Field from fakenamegenerator )<br />Numer domu ( House Number; The Number for the Main Address Line, is located in the Address Field from fakenamegenerator. )<br />Miejscowość ( City/Locality; The City the Address is located for, is located in the Address Field from fakenamegenerator. )<br />Kod pocztowy ( Zip/Post-Code; The Zip/Post-Code, is located in the Address Field from fakenamegenerator. )<br /><br />When everything has been filled in, click the green button at the bottom titled &quot;Dalej&quot; which translates into &quot;Next/Further&quot;.<br /><br />Stage 2/4 Dane do rejestracji ( Registration Data ): You will be presented with the following screen/image: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/6wZA.png<br /><br />At this point you should have the first page ( which looks like this: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/2NJd.jpg ) with the Card from the Letter in front of you: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/SZtk.jpg - Green Markings are just Censored and the Red Markings are Information of Interest for Later. Remove the Card and take note of the Red Markings on the following image: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/NAPO.jpg<br /><br />Pełen numer rachunku karty ( Full Account Number; Fill in your IBAN which is 26 characters long, you can either find it on Page one by &quot;Rachunek&quot; or on the back of the Card Itself at the bottom. )<br />6 pierwszych cyfr numeru karty ( The first 6 digits of the Card Number; Fill in the first Six Numbers from your Card, for example almost certain 483047 indicates an EUR Card. )<br />4 ostatnie cyfry numeru karty ( The last 4 digits of the card number; Fill in the last Four Numbers from your Card, simple as that. )<br />Dotychczasowy kod aktywacyjny ( The current Activation/PIN Code; Your current Active PIN, I&#039;ve marked the location of where you can find it in the following image: http://www.torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/k4fj.jpg )<br />Nadaj PIN ( New PIN; Enter your New PIN Code which will be utilized for ATM Transactions. )<br />Potwierdź nadany PIN ( Confirm New PIN; Enter the same PIN Code as above. )<br /><br />There&#039;s three options after this, not sure what difference it would make if checked or not but it&#039;s probably advisable to have them checked as they are as default and just press the green button called &quot;Dalej&quot; which translates into Next/Further.<br /><br />Stage 3/4 Weryfikacja danych ( Data Verification ): You will be presented with the following screen/image: http://torimagesbp2vt3u.onion/i/vRrt.png<br /><br />Here you will be presented with all Information you&#039;ve provided so far.

Congratulations, you&#039;ve now successfully Registered your Card. :)<br />The Online Interface gives you access to detailed History over your Card(s) and most likely the function to send money to other Accounts ( haven&#039;t investigated this Aspect so not familiar with how to use it ).<br /><br />The most important reason/point of registering online is the fact you get to change your PIN Code, and secondarily I personally use it to see whenever the money has arrived at one card ( if I move funds over to say four cards with the same Account I only need to confirm it&#039;s arrived at one most of the time ).<br />----------<br />To transfer funds to your Card, simply take your IBAN and add the characters &quot;PL&quot; before, ie. PL##########################. For SWIFT (BIC code) use: WBKPPLPP

				Very nice indeed! <br /><br />So with the way the exchanges in Europe work, not many of them wire dollars do they? Even though some of the cards can take dollars, what&#039;s the new exchange scenery going to look like? Eventually, when all the exchanges require verification to qualify for moving fiat out in bank wires, the fake ids WILL need to be polish and match your card registration, right?<br /><br />SS
