				You could pretend to be a hooker, then when the cop pulls over (either to send you on your way or to hire you), coax him out of the car (either with a seductive wink or a shriek of &quot;you&#039;ll have to catch me first&quot;), then have a small midget sneak in and do the deed. <br /><br />It COULD work...

Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.<br /><br />You see the potential risk from having illegal drugs sent to your home. You think that if a powerful politician got caught with drugs being shipped to his home -that would illuminate the problem for law enforcement. The problem&nbsp; is that anyone can ship drugs to anyone else in the mail. <br /><br />I think that wouldn&#039;t work and here is why: Selective Enforcement<br />Clearnet: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_enforcement<br /><br />The police do not enforce the laws against people that can get away with breaking them. If you ever wonder why&nbsp; (a very popular and powerful politician) Ted Kennedy was never charged with Manslaughter (accidental death)&nbsp; or at least drunk driving for the Chappaquiddick incident -it&#039;s because the system only enforces the laws against people like you and me.

				Thanks to Bluto, I have another thought.<br /><br />In order to have law enforcement, there must be separate laws to protect LEO than are used to protect citizens (i.e. assault on a person vs assault on a law enforcement officer are treated very differently), otherwise everyone&#039;s say is equal to everyone&#039;s. (A true democracy, if you will.)<br /><br />In the scenario of a politician being found with drugs in their vehicle, you have a couple things going against you in terms of actually having criminal charges brought against them.<br /><br />In the first, they are recognized as being targets for attacks, since that&#039;s what happens to anyone with a notable position in government or with significant popularity. That being said, it wouldn&#039;t be the most difficult thing to believe what they say when &quot;I&#039;ve been framed&quot; comes out of their mouth. Of course this isn&#039;t where it ends, but it&#039;s certainly not as easy as planted the package on some nobody you&#039;ve got beef with.<br /><br />In the second, they have to have demonstrated a past criminal history or at least have some knock to their credibility when they claim framing, in order for any charge to really stick. If they are a stand-up model citizen in their community, it will be much more difficult for them to get picked up for it, especially if it&#039;s an amount that is deemed big enough for selling. (Remember, LE aren&#039;t idiots: they know how much is a buyer&#039;s stash and how much is a seller&#039;s moving inventory.) If a felony amount that&#039;s clearly for selling, wouldn&#039;t it make sense for them to have it if they were having financial issues, and they were unaccounted for at odd hours of the night? Or had unexplained sources of income?<br /><br />If you really want to put someone away, you&#039;d have to do a lot of research. If you&#039;re just looking to scare them or intimidate them, disregard what I&#039;ve said and get down to business. :)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=207142.msg1495122#msg1495122">Quote from: underbelly on August 27, 2013, 10:07 am</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Would be very productive being done to a crooked cop... <br /><br />1.

They&#039;re probably trained to watch for people following them, especially to their home, but if you wanted to find where someone lives, all you need to do is rely on their daily/nightly routine to gather your intel. They are humans are too, with all their human flaws.<br /><br />2) Gloves are the time-honored way of keeping prints from appearing. Nitrile or latex gloves are an option, baseball or driving gloves being a more nonchalant method.<br /><br />As for access, this one&#039;s tricky but not impossible. Like I said, cops are humans too - so are politicians. Watch anyone for a day, and you&#039;ll see plenty of small windows opening to do bad things to their vehicle. I imagine politicians aren&#039;t as used to looking over their shoulder as law enforcement agents are, so they&#039;ll be even easier. It only takes a moment waiting in a parking garage, where the target has just left their vehicle to walk into their place of work, and you&#039;ve already opened a door to their vehicle just before they lock it. People often take several steps away from their vehicle before locking it, and that&#039;s all it takes to get a door open. <br /><br />Of course they&#039;ll notice when the car doesn&#039;t honk (if they usually hit the remote locker enough times to make their vehicle honk when locking), so your window is very small. But again, they&#039;re not expecting to have drugs planted on them. So they return to the vehicle, find a door left partially open, think it strange and do a quick sweep for any changes and close it, going to work with a serious suspicion on their mind - which they never find out until it&#039;s too late if you are good at hiding things in cars quickly.<br /><br />Just a few thoughts on the subject. Great questions. :)

				It&#039;d have to be more believable than that. You&#039;d have to somehow get the politicians DNA, and plant it all over some drugs or a piece, and then leave some kind of evidence that someone would be able to look at and guess it was a politician, and then plant it in some random spot and hope some person turns it in or law enforcement runs across it.

				There has to be a certain amount of man hours spent by LE/internal affairs even when this happens to LEO&#039;s or Politicians.<br />So even if it just costs a few thousand dollars or a few hundread man hours looking into it each and every time a LEO or politician had a loose package mailed to them then it would still be worth it. The smallest amount of drugs would trigger an investigation and no matter how small or how little press attention it gets, it is a small cost and would fuck LE a lot more than it would cost.<br />i.e. cost-benefit analysis says it pays off IMO. <br /><br />This would make the DEA and LE and people in govt look bad too.<br /><br />tl,dr It will cost LE time and money to look into these cases and if this loose package operation is done on a large enough scale it has a few different ways to benefit, while at the same time time costing very little.
