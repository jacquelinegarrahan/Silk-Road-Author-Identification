				Sorry for the poor translation btw, i just ran it through google translate to give you guys an update what is going on here. <br /><br />It is not 100% clear if this bust is based (solely) on their SR activities, since the information was obtained through a phone tap that had been running for a month. It is possible that dutch authorities got a heads up about this from the FBI since the server image they obtained is old enough to precede the wire tap. But it also possible that they got the tap based on other evidence, perhaps the purchase of the mdma power or other equipment. <br /><br />For anyone looking for information: The town is named &#039;Zetten&#039;, which google translate transformed into &#039;Crossing&#039;. <br /><br />Interestingly, no BTC have been seized in this case (yet), just plain old cash so far, over $130k of it.
