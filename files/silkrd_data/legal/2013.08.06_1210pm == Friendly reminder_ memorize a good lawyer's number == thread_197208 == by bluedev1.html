				If bad luck should come your way and you find yourself wrongfully arrested, you will NOT be given access to any of your belongings, including your cell phone (which people rely so much upon for phone numbers these days), so it is very important that you memorize a good lawyer&#039;s phone number.&nbsp; It&#039;s also important to remember to communicate to the LE that you are invoking your right to remain silent and will not answer any questions without your attorney present.&nbsp; &nbsp;After that, you STFU no matter what they say because most of it will be a lie anyway, their only mission after detaining you is to ensure a successful prosecution.&nbsp; No matter what charades they put on, you do not answer any questions without your attorney present, period.&nbsp; &nbsp;You might already be screwed but by talking, things can only get worse, never better.&nbsp; If you say &quot;Can I use the bathroom&quot; they could use this to write in an affidavit that you seemed confused, I am not bullshitting, everything will be twisted to be used against you in some way.&nbsp; That is the nature of our fucked up criminal justice system.&nbsp; <br /><br />And I pray you never need to take any of this advice!

				Personally, if you don&#039;t expect you will be up for serious crimes (anything beyond simple possession), I would never get a lawyer...&nbsp; Refuse duty counsel, get in front of a judge, present yourself well, and say that you are not able to obtain effective legal advice until you are released.&nbsp; If you step up like that, the judge will almost always let a petty crime go with a promise to appear.&nbsp; Then you can delay your date multiple times if you feel it by just showing up and saying you haven&#039;t gotten a lawyer yet.<br /><br />This only applies if you have a clean record and the charges you expect are minor of course.&nbsp; In other cases, like large scale traffickers of harder drugs... it would be better to have that lawyer&#039;s number memorized.

				Hmm, for a simple possession charge you could be right, a lawyer would probably not be worth it if it&#039;s a first offense and not a significant amount.&nbsp; <br /><br />Charges that would come from an investigation into SR related activity would certainly go beyond that though.&nbsp; You would be looking at multiple felonies in the US.&nbsp; <br /><br />At any rate, it&#039;s still not a bad idea to memorize a good lawyer&#039;s number.&nbsp;
