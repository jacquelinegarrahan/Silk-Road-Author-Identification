				I was originally gonna fly down with anywhere from 6-9k in cash(100s&nbsp; and 50s)<br /><br />I spoke to my buddy who will be receiving me when I get down there and he told me that hes gone down with a ridiculous amount of money before and been questioned by dea cuz of all the magnetic strips accumulated setting off flags. <br />I feel as if he woulda had at least 20-30k in cash when he did it and maybe thats why it would happen for him<br /><br />He told me I could easily go with 2-3k in cash all in 100s without raising suspicion<br /><br />I want to bring more than 2-3 k and truly don&#039;t see how just money (especially anything over 10-20k) alone could give them a reason to look further into my life<br /><br />any and all help would be appreciated, leaving within the next 48 hours <br /><br />

				Usually, anything under $10k doesn&#039;t raise flags, I&#039;d keep it under $8000 just to be sure.

				^^^ I was thinking of that actually haha. Ive never mailed large amounts of money like that before, def sounds doable. I don&#039;t know what I would do if that package disappeared, I don&#039;t know that I can trust with 100% that the package doesnt get claimed by someone else at the location I will be staying at.<br /><br />hmmmm<br />sig required.... hmmmmm

				I wouldn&#039;t bring more than $4k on you. Pretty sure you have to claim more than $5k when you are flying, but more than 4 is going to raise eyebrows. Find someone you trust with disposable income and see if they can write you a check for your cash before you fly out. Or do (a) money order(s). It sounds like bullshit, but I&#039;ve heard of people getting arrested for having bills that smell like weed (drugs). Also, TSA doesn&#039;t need a good reason to mess with you. A bunch of 20s, 50s, and 100s are enough to get them to detain you.

				I had a partner who was stopped by airport security and questioned because he had about $60k packed in with his cloths. The airport contacted local police and some guys in suits questioned him and went through his stuff for a few minutes until he called our lawyer, who told him to tell them he wouldn&#039;t consent to anything more without a lawyer present. They let him go pretty quickly after that. If you already have a lawyer in the state you are flying out of that&#039;s ideal, but even if you don&#039;t you&#039;ll get pretty much the same advice from anyone. Legally you are allowed to fly with any amount of money, just stay calm and keep a lawyers number handy.

				I flew with $10k when I was like 19 or 20...but I split it up in 2 bank slaves with my other buddy. It was before the body scanners too so I just put it in my pocket I believe. Man I miss that.

				Yep.......Jah....is correct......they can seize that money.....and you have to prove how you got the money.......8k and under.....and your just on vacation.....:)<br /><br />Friend had 15k seized at the airport.....never got arrested.......but could not provide a good reason for having that cash.....they seized it.....and it took him over a year to get it back.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote"><a href="http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=203931.msg1469867#msg1469867">Quote from: JahBUDS on August 19, 2013, 11:39 pm</a></div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Anything over 10k and you&#039;re getting questioned..

				Carry poker chips/playing cards, wear a poker stars hat, and if you&#039;re really concerned have your lawyer write a letter stating that you&#039;re frequently involved in high-stakes gambling.&nbsp; There is no law regarding how much money you can carry on domestic flights (international is 10k), but as people have said they can grill you about it and confiscate the money if you have no reason for it.<br /><br />Another tactic would be to start a falsified e-mail conversation w/ yourself discussing the purchase of a very expensive item that has to be examined in person before purchase.&nbsp; A piece of artwork would be ideal for this.

				under 10k or have a reason to have all that cash, ie. buying some big ticket item. Find a nice car on CL and if anyone asks, that is why you are in cali and why you have so much cash.

				Cashiers Check. I cant cite the exact cases right now, but technically, if you are carrying a large amount of cash, even if you have an excuse as to why you are, LEO can sieze that cash and make you prove it&#039;s legit, which may take up to a year, and even then they will generally require some type of bribe to get your money back. This is due to a supreme court decision that basically states no one whose funds were received by legitimate means would have that much cash that wasn&#039;t in a bank. <br /><br />Do research (google) &quot;policing for profit&quot;. You MAY get to your destination without any problems but if one does arise, you&#039;re going to be fighting a very long and expensive fight to get your money back, and even then,ggood luck getting all of it back.

I would ALWAYS fly domestically with cash. I put a few grand in my wallet and a few grand in my big carry on and a few in my small carry on. A bank bag with a deposit slip pre-made out to a business account in your destination state is a good idea. But mailing domestically has always worked for me. Internationally I would bring $9,999.99 just to fuck with them if they stop me. It says you know the law and just have a withdrawal slip and a letter of introduction to the guy you wanna buy a boat from in the foreign country.<br /><br />And PLEASE wear a fucking suit and tie and groom yourself and be nice but not too nice.<br /><br />Modzi

				And honestly.. for anyone that knows anything about our shitty economy... I do believe you&#039;re allowed UP TO 10 personal hobbies... WHICH are allowed to generate up to 10k/month... so &quot;high-stakes gambling&quot; would work.. and so would a whole plethora of other things. Be safe.. that&#039;s the number 1 hobby any of us should have though. :) Safe travels.
